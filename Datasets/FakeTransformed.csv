10183,"WATCH: CNN DOES SEGMENT From Bunker In Hawaii, Tells Viewers Hawaii’s Been Preparing For Nuclear Strike Since Trump Took Office…CNN’s Best Survival Tip: “FIND A CAVE”","CNN host Erin Burnett started out her segment on the threat of a nuclear attack by North Korea by explaining to her (very small) audience the danger Hawaii could face if nuclear North Korea, (the same nation Obama left ignored for 8 years), decided to strike Hawaii:  Guam of course, is not the only island within striking distance of North Korea. Another potential target within Kim Jong Un s range is Hawaii, which is where Sarah Sidner is live tonight. She s inside a bunker in Honolulu which houses the emergency center s state warning point.  Of course, there was no mention in Burnett s dramatic warning to her viewers of how Obama ignored the the very real nuclear threat that North Korea posed to the United States, or that President Trump was left to deal with a serious issue that President Bill Clinton bragged about handling while he was in office.Sidner went on to explain the very real threat that North Korea posed to the island of Hawaii and how Hawaiian officials there have been preparing for (here s the magic number)  at least seven months  (which, not surprisingly is about exactly the time that President Trump was inaugurated).Sidner then went on to explain that if a nuclear attack did take place on the island that not everyone would be affected. She explained to viewers in Hawaii, that if a nuclear missile was about to strike, they should get out of their cars and move to the inside of a building or their home, or find a cave. Find a cave?Watch the exchange here: Missile launch from North Korea to Hawaii is 20 mins. To create fear, @CNN reports from an underground bunker. https://t.co/Ylr5jbnk8k   A.D.

4168, Trump FURIOUS After New Poll DEVASTATES His Campaign,"NBC News third post-leaked audio, post-second debate poll shows something quite shocking (but not really): Hillary Clinton is gaining an insurmountable lead over Donald Trump, with just three weeks left to go until election day.The new poll, conducted October 10 through the 13th, with 1,000 respondents, shows Clinton with an 11-point lead, 48 to 37 percent over Trump. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has seven percent in support and Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 2 percent.In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton maintains a 10 point lead, 51-41, with 10 percent undecided.As NBC News put it:To put Clinton s current 11-point lead into perspective, Barack Obama beat John McCain by seven points nationally in 2008. And Obama s margin of victory over Mitt Romney in 2012 was four points.Both pollsters who coordinated with NBC News, Democrat Fred Yang and Republican Bill McInturff, both came to the conclusion that Trump does not have a chance of winning the presidency.One of the biggest contributing factors to Clinton s lead in her 20 point advantage with women (55-35 percent), her 60 point advantage with non-white voters (76-16 percent), and her gain among men in which she s behind by just three points, 48-45 percent.The poll als0 shows President Obama s approval rating at 53 percent, a positive for Clinton heading into the final stretch of the election.Now that the polls have shown a consistent lead for Clinton, Trump has no other way to legitimize his failing, pathetic campaign than to claim it s going to be  rigged  against them thanks to minority communities, dead people, a globalist conspiracy.Now that InfoWars has overtaken his campaign, the public has been turned off and are showing that they are ready for Hillary.Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton an 86 percent chance of winning the election and Trump a 14 percent chance. This marks the 10th day that Clinton has been in the high 80s, the same place she was at after the Democratic National Convention.Trump has a lot of ground came to catch up on. Can he do it in three weeks?

5946, Elizabeth Warren Just Proved Why She’s Trump’s Absolute WORST Nightmare (VIDEO),"If there s anyone who has clearly had enough of Donald Trump s ridiculous bullying shenanigans, it s Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Time after time she has just absolutely pummeled his rhetoric and isn t intimidated at all by his name-calling and hyperbolic antics. If she s not battling him on Facebook, she s battling him on Twitter. If she s not facing off with him on social media, she nailing him in a speech. She wants to make damn sure that pompous man gets nowhere near the Oval Office.Going after him yet again, right before her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president, Warren spoke at the American Constitution Society s national convention. She hit him over the head with the fact that he s a racist bully who is trying to intimidate a judge out of doing his job just because he s of Mexican heritage, albeit born in Indiana. Trump doesn t want him hearing his Trump University case for the very racist reason that Judge Curiel is Latino.One of Warren s best lines from her speech came when she said: Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life. Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself. BOOM! Wow. So, so true.Trump cannot be president. He doesn t have any of the necessary experience required to be leader of the free world. He wants to be president not for the nation, but for himself, to say that he won. He s a blowhard who deserves to be condemned, and you can bet your ass Elizabeth Warren will keeping hitting him, and hitting him hard.And what scares a fragile, insecure man the most?

8865, Racist Moron Gets Fired For This 20 Second Video Of Him Shouting ‘Wetback’… At An Arabic Person (VIDEO),"It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers. Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it. Occasionally, the imbecile will be found and karma will collect their job, or in the very least, they re forced to quit the internet.In this case, the story has one added hilarious twist: The dumbass shouts the slur, loses his job and gets called out   and he couldn t even get it right. During his hand-clapping chorus of  Beaner! Beaner! Wetback! Wetback!  the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is. In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic. Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests. Maybe he felt if he called her something as clever as  towel head  she would detonate.Or perhaps he really is just that stupid.The man, an Oregonian identified as an employee of a small company, Wolcott Plumbing, now has bigger fish to fry. He ll be waiting in line Monday at the unemployment office. After local station KGB got hold of the video and reported on it, a company official wrote: First of all, this is a very upsetting situation. Under no circumstances do I personally nor do we as a company condone the use of abusive language of any kind to anyone. Upon further investigation today, I learned and confirmed it was one of my employees in the video. This employee was immediately terminated. When will idiots like this racist numbskull learn that those cell phones aimed at them while they spew their stupidity are recording?

23008,Patrick Henningsen and Don DeBar Discuss Trump’s ‘Immigration Ban’ and the Media Reaction,"Sputnik Radio s new program Trend Storm is hosted by American geopolitical analyst and writer Andrew Korybko. This week, Andrew explores what s really driving the media uproar and political protests surrounding President Trump s executive order on immigration Andrew Korybko Trend StormUS President Donald Trump s controversial Executive Order to temporarily limit the entrance of select foreign nationals to the US is becoming a larger-than-life scandal of epic proportions.Following through on yet another of his campaign promises, America s new leader has banned people from seven countries from entering the US, building off of the list of supposedly terrorist-prone countries that his predecessor first identified. The immediacy of the order caught many people off guard, and there was confusion about whether it would apply to permanent residents (green card-holders), already-vetted refugees, and individuals in transit. Almost immediately after the announcement was made last Friday, thousands of people across the US flocked to their local airports to protest the measure. In doing so, they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures, which during regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at locations considered essential to the nation s infrastructure.The protesters claimed that Trump had  banned Muslims  from entering the US, and the hashtag #MuslimBan instantly started trending on Twitter. In defense of the motion, Trump and his surrogates said that most majority-Muslim countries were untouched by the temporary border restrictions, pointing out that Indonesia   the world s most populous Muslim country   isn t on the list, for example. Moreover, in a cynical retort to the critics, they reminded the public that Obama had earlier suspended the US refugee program for Iraqi nationals for half a year back in 2011, though no such protests erupted at that time. Nevertheless, it s hard for the Trump Administration to shake the social media stigma that this is a  Muslim Ban , no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to nothing more than a brief review period for high-risk countries prior to the implementation of what s being called  extreme vetting.  This is because the mainstream US media is very sympathetic to what Trump and his spokespeople have termed the  political opposition,  namely, the Democratic Party.The perception management and narrative-building that these two institutions are known for was seen vividly and on full display during the presidential campaign, but it s gotten even more intense since Trump s election. Just like back then, however, it doesn t seem to be doing its intended job, since a Reuters poll released on Tuesday found that 49% of Americans are in favor of the President s action, while 41% are against it.Patrick Henningsen, Founder and Executive Editor of 21stCenturyWire.com and the host of the Sunday Wire Show, and Don DeBar, host of a syndicated daily radio newscast CPR News heard across the US, commented on the issue  .

20481,WHY ARE VAN LOADS OF ILLEGALS Being Moved and Released Away From The Border?,"The insanity continues! The outrageous invasion on our southern border has been so out of control in the past seven years but it s gotten to crisis mode recently with a HUGE surge in illegals from all over the world. Yes, we ve become a GLOBAL MAGNET for anyone to cross our border. Soooo what s the reason for the illegals to be released? You ll never believe it! It s because the detention centers are FULL! No kidding! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents, Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch.The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road. The OTMs are from Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix. Authorities didn t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they re in the country legally, according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter. American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a  credible fear,  Border Patrol sources told JW. None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents, but were told to  promise  they d show up for a hearing when notified, said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation.A security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is called G4S and claims to be the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida. Judicial Watch is filing a number of public records requests to get more information involving the arrangement between G4S and the government, specifically the transport of illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to other parts of the country. The photo accompanying this story shows the uniformed G4S guard that transported the OTMs this week from Tucson to Phoenix.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there s no room to keep them in detention.  They re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,  said one law enforcement official in Arizona.  Just move those bodies across the country.  Officially, DHS denies this is occurring and in fact earlier this year U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske blasted Border Patrol union officials for denouncing this dangerous catch-and-release policy. Kerlikowske s scolding came in response to the congressional testimony of Bandon Judd, chief of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents. Judd told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee that illegal immigrants without serious criminal convictions can be released immediately and disappear into the shadows. Kerlikowske shot back, telling a separate congressional committee:  I would not stand by if the Border Patrol was   releasing people without going through all of the formalities. Yet, that s exactly what s occurring. This report, part of an ongoing Judicial Watch investigation into the security risks along the southern border, features only a snippet of a much broader crisis in which illegal aliens are being released and vanishing into unsuspecting American communities. The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest addressed this issue just a few weeks ago in a hearing called Declining Deportations and Increasing Criminal Alien Releases   The Lawless Immigration Policies of the Obama Administration. Judd, the Border Patrol Union chief, delivered alarming figures at the hearing. He estimated that about 80% of apprehended illegal immigrants are released into the United States.Read more: Judicial Watch",left-news,"Jun 3, 2016",insanity invasion border control crisis mode surge world yes magnet anyone border reason detention department homeland security border court appearance patrol watch government week phoenix bus station way watch group phoenix greyhound station buckeye road border patrol week batch custody couple days family bus ticket trip bother identity country border patrol official matter fare fear border patrol none court appearance hearing firsthand knowledge operation security company government border patrol sector custody firm world security group headquarters watch number information arrangement government transport border country photo story guard week border patrol room detention bus law enforcement official country fact year customs border protection commissioner patrol union catch release policy response testimony chief border patrol labor union line house committee committee border patrol people report part watch investigation security border snippet crisis subcommittee immigration interest issue hearing alien immigration administration border patrol union chief hearing watch
4834, WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager Blames Women For Rape,"Once again, a Republican rape comment surfaces, and it s from the campaign manager of the Republican nominee.Donald Trump s campaign has been full of sexism and misogyny, so it was only a matter of time before his third campaign manager Kellyanne Conway made her own offensive comment about rape.In 2013, despite Republicans being advised to keep their mouths shut about women and rape, Conway appeared in a panel discussion to talk about women in the military. At some point, Conway used rape as an analogy even though rape was not part of the discussion.Conway blamed women for being raped because they are not as physically strong as men and that  rape would not exist  if only women were not so weak. If we were physiologically   not mentally, emotionally, professionally   equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist,  Conway said.  You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off. Here s the video via YouTube. Conway s rape comment is at the 2 minute mark.Conway s comment assumes that all rapes can be prevented simply by being physically strong. Unfortunately, rapists have many tricks to incapacitate their victims, including date rape drugs. Being strong also does not work very well if a rapist has their victim at knifepoint or gunpoint.Instead of blaming rapists, Conway openly blamed women for rape. She was a Republican pollster at the time, but now she is the campaign manager for the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.Clearly, Trump either did not vet Conway at all or he is okay with what she had to say about rape.But this adds to the pattern of Republicans blaming the victim instead of the rapist. For years, Republicans have been saying outrageous things about rape. Here s 40 of them.Trump is just another Republican in a long line of Republicans who apparently believe women are at fault if they get raped. His hiring of Conway clearly demonstrates that. They seem to think it s acceptable to blame rape victims for their assaults, deny women the right to control their own health care, and downplay sexual harassment in the workplace,  Daily Show creator Liz Winstead responded to Conway s remarks.  It s not.

15399,IVANA TRUMP SPEAKS OUT AGAINST LEFTIST RAG’S FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF EX DONALD “RAPING” HER,"Hmmm Ever wonder why the left fears Trump so much? The Daily Beast s Tim Mak and Brandon Zadrozny woke up on Tuesday to find that CNN completely embarrassed them. After publishing a more-than-1,700-word-long invective on Monday evening reprinting old and disproven allegations against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by his ex-wife in divorce proceedings Trump s ex-wife herself came out with a statement to CNN standing by her ex-husband, and discrediting the liberal outlet s hit piece which relied heavily on statements she made in divorce proceedings 30 years ago. I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president,  Ivana Trump, Donald s ex-wife, said in the statement to CNN.Donald and Ivana Trump had three children together Ivanka, Eric and Donald, Jr., Donald s oldest children and now all officials at Trump s company three of Trump s five children.The embarrassing and quick putdown of the Daily Beast story comes just hours after the outlet ran a blistering headline falsely accusing him of rape:  Ex-Wife: Donald Trump Made Me Feel  Violated  During Sex. The sub-headline of the inaccurate article was even worse, directly leveling the false rape allegation:  Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of  rape,  although she later clarified: not in the  criminal sense. The way they justified dredging up the three-decade-old allegation from divorce proceeding transcript, which was again per Ivana s statement to CNN clearly false? Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being  rapists  and bringing crime into the country.  Mak and Zadrozny wrote as the lead of their article before delving into the lurid, old and disproven details.  I mean somebody s doing it!  Who s doing the raping?  Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization. It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump in more ways than one. From there, they delve into the old allegations:  Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used  rape  to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt  violated  by the experience. The incident did come up in the divorce proceedings transcripts and was first reported on widely and publicly by former Texas Monthly and former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III in his 1993 book:  Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. So, what did Mak and Zadrozny do?

1271, Trump Live Tweets About ‘Fox And Friends’ While Mass Shooting In Orlando Unfolds,"Trump spent his second day having a mental breakdown on Twitter with no signs of stopping. Situations around the world are at a particularly dire moment   the Middle East on the brink of war, the terror attack in London, a major infrastructure bill being drawn up   but Trump woke up and immediately turned on the Fox News morning entertainment show, Fox and Friends. Instead of getting his morning intelligence briefing, he live-tweeted incoherently about whatever subjects the Fox hosts brought up.First Trump s Muslim ban Then how Democrats are  obstructing  his ambassadorship picks. (Fact check: They aren t. Trump has nominated almost no one and most spots remain vacant due to his inaction.).@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017Finally, he once again viciously lashed out at the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, taking his original lie and adding even more lies on top to smear the British politician.Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The mayor s  no reason to be alarmed  quote comes from a larger message where he told British citizens that they would be seeing an increased police presence and that the number of cops was  no reason to be alarmed.  Trump stripped the context and pretended the mayor was saying that terror attacks were no reason to be alarmed. Trump said that because on Fox and Friends yesterday a guest made a similar claim. He either hasn t been corrected about the false information he learned on Fox News or doesn t care.Trump did all of this while a mass shooting in Orlando unfolded. Unlike the terror attack in London, this one was a workplace dispute and done with a gun. Five people died.Five people were killed in a shooting at Fiamma, a business on North Forsyth Road near Hanging Moss Road near Orlando, the Orange County Sheriff s Office reported this morning, calling it a  tragic incident. The shooter   a former  disgruntled employee  who was fired in April   then killed himself, shooter, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. The shooter had previously been accused of battering a fellow employee.Trump, who needs reasons to justify his Muslim ban, doesn t seem to care much about mass shootings that don t fit the narrative that only scary Islamic terrorists are capable of violence. His silence on the shooting speaks volumes. It was also in stark contrast to his earlier response to London.When a tragedy hit London, he quickly retweeted an unsubstantiated claim made by right-wing conspiracy site, the Drudge Report. He then spent the night and next morning going on a rant about Muslims. He urged people in England to be scared, doing the work of the terrorists for them.In contrast, when a nearly equal number of Americans die in a way that is painfully normal for the country with a major gun violence problem, Trump can t be bothered to even offer condolences. But then, Fox and Friends, which also hates to acknowledge gun violence, probably didn t mention the shooting so how would our president ever know about it?Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2017",trump day breakdown twitter world moment east brink war terror attack infrastructure bill trump news morning entertainment show fox morning intelligence briefing fox trump ban ambassadorship fact check trump one inaction forever people nothing trump june mayor khan lie top politician excuse mayor khan reason statement trump june mayor reason quote message police presence number reason trump context mayor terror reason trump fox yesterday guest claim information news care trump mass shooting terror attack dispute people people shooting business road moss road orange county sheriff office morning incident shooter employee orange county sheriff jerry shooter employee trump ban mass narrative violence silence contrast response tragedy hit claim conspiracy site drudge report night morning rant people work contrast number way country gun violence problem trump fox violence mention shooting president image pool

3180, General Motors NAILS Trump For Lying After He Accuses Them Of Making Chevy Cruze In Mexico,"Donald Trump just attacked an American car company and got humiliated in response.In his first tweet of the day on Tuesday, Trump accused General Motors of manufacturing the Chevy Cruze in Mexico and shipping it across the border tax-free to sell in the United States. He then threatened them to make the car here or pay a huge tax penalty.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017There s just one problem. Most Chevy Cruzes are made here in the United States by American workers.General Motors fired back at Trump in a statement. General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S. But as a result of Trump s accusations and threats General Motors  stock price tumbled briefly and then recovered. Keep in mind that General Motors was nearly wiped out of existence at the beginning of the Great Recession, which would have cost thousands of Americans their jobs. Trump s attack on General Motors could have harmed the company in a way that would have harmed American workers he the stock price fallen more than it did.And Americans were unforgiving on Twitter in response to Trump s bullshit and even called out the fact that GM CEO Mary Barra is one of Trump s economic advisers.@realDonaldTrump attacks on individuals companies are crony capitalism, with potentially devastating consequences. https://t.co/sUEgf4lLFI  Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump and isn t GM s chairman and chief executive, Mary Barra, one of your appointments to your economic advisory panel?

14736,BREAKING: New CA Law Will Allow Cops To Confiscate Legally Owned Guns,"The drip drip drip of communism in the leftist state of California A new California law scheduled to take effect Friday will allow the police to seize private, legally-owned weapons for up to three weeks without charges or allowing the citizen to contest the seizure.AB1014 was passed last year in the wake of 2014 s Isla Vista shooting, where teenager Elliot Rodger went on a rampage near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six people along with himself.Rodger s parents had reported him to the police prior to the shooting, concerned about his mental health and rants he posted online. But after meeting with Rodger, police decided he wasn t a criminal risk, and consequently didn t search his apartment, where he was stockpiling weapons and ammunition.The new law is intended to stop such a situation from re-occurring. Under the law, a judge has the power to grant a restraining order telling police to seize a person s guns, based solely on accounts from family members or police that the person is poses an imminent danger to others. The restraining order can be granted without the affected person knowing it exists or being allowed time to contest it.Under the law, the factors a judge can consider in granting the restraining order include not only threats of violence, but also prior felony arrests (even without a conviction), evidence of alcohol abuse, and even the simple act of recently purchasing a gun or ammunition.Once granted, police can use the restraining order to confiscate all of a person s guns and ammunition, and the person is also barred from buying or possessing guns and ammo for the duration of the order. A full court hearing must then be heard within three weeks. At that hearing, a judge will be able to extend the restraining order for an entire year. The law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,  Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told Southern California Public Radio.  It allows further examination of the person s mental state. The law expands on California gun laws that are already some of the country s toughest. Police already have the power to seize a person s guns if a licensed therapist informs them that the person s mental state makes them a danger to themselves or others.

3485, Trump Team Allegedly Offering Government Appointments To Entertainment Scouts,"The Trump team has shown one thing in the last month   they are the worst when it comes to draining the swamp. They have packed the cabinet with the biggest, ugliest swamp monsters, whether they be charter school billionaires or Goldman Sachs executives.Just when you thought it couldn t get any slimier, it gets way worse.Apparently, the Trump team is having a hard time finding entertainers for the upcoming inauguration. No one   and that means no one   wants to be associated with that freak show. Not even jail-bait loving Ted Nugent has signed on to help. So naturally, Trump is desperate, lest his ego suffer a blow.The Trump team is so desperate, that they are actually offering government appointments to those who can find and secure entertainment for the inauguration. According to sources who spoke to The Wrap:Donald Trump s inaugural committee is scrambling to lock in A-list Hollywood performers for the parties celebrating him   and having a rough time booking big names, two insiders tell TheWrap. Both said that Trump inaugural committee members have contacted them in recent days offering cash or even a government appointment if they could deliver marquee names.Of course, the team denied this was happening, saying they are instead  organizing an exciting and uniting celebration of freedom and democracy while following all rules, regulations and appropriate standards of conduct. Jenn Topper, the spokeswoman for the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization focused on transparency and accountability in government, said,  Without knowing more specifics about the arrangements, it s difficult to say whether this would violate ethics laws or rules, but it certainly raises questions. Imagine if Hillary Clinton offered government jobs to entertainment scouts. Then again, Hillary Clinton wouldn t have a problem booking big-wigs to attend her inauguration.Donald Trump is already using his newfound power to offer kickbacks to his personal business and to those who help his image. he has no clue what he s getting himself into, but he likes the attention and the ego bolstering (even if it comes at the expense of our democracy).Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images",News,"December 9, 2016",trump team thing month swamp cabinet swamp school way trump team time inauguration one one freak show bait loving trump ego blow trump team government entertainment inauguration wrap trump committee list time committee days cash government appointment course team exciting celebration freedom democracy conduct spokeswoman foundation organization transparency accountability government ethics government entertainment problem inauguration trump power business image clue attention ego expense democracy image pope

21981,Agent Angelina: Are CIA Using Hollywood’s Jolie as Soft Power Operative?,"21st Century Wire says In previous articles, 21WIRE has consistently raised the question of whether or not the CIA and the Pentagon have been using Hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas. This charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a  conspiracy theory    even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice, and one with historic precedents. Seems that the mainstream claim that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that  won t fly anymore.  We have talked about Dennis Rodman, and George Clooney as two high-profile  ambassadors  of the US, inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various PR, strategic or intelligence ends.This latest admission regarding actress Angelina Jolie is even more telling   where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive (and possibly non-existent) Joseph Kony of the Lord s Resistance Army in the jungles of Uganda.Andrew Korybko Oriental ReviewIt s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes CIA psy-op narratives in her films, but this time new leaks allege that Angelina Jolie had also at one time considered being the Pentagon s  bait  to  catch Kony , which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities  foreign policy forays such as Dennis Rodman s  friendship  with Kim Jong-Un. Agent AngelinaAngelina Jolie is the poster woman for the  Hollywood-Intelligence Complex , the perfect example of a willing CIA asset who regularly goes along with  deep state  narratives in her films, such as the anti-Serb production  In The Land Of Blood And Honey . She s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for  humanitarian interventions  abroad, or in other words, imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated  humanitarian  reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in Darfur. Jolie often visits US troops abroad like in Afghanistan, though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist, as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefield.That s no longer the case anymore, though, according to a report by The Sunday Times, a UK-based media outlet, which claims to have read leaked International Criminal Court (ICC) documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal African warlord Joseph Kony. The Sunday Times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall, however, so the average information consumer needs to rely on second-hand sources such as People magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge. According to the celebrity news site: A hoard of 40,000 ICC documents leaked to the French investigative website Mediapart reveals that Jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.She  has the idea to invite Kony to dinner and then arrest him,  reads an e-mail sent by former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, reports The Sunday Times. Forget other celebrities, she is the one,  Moreno Ocampo adds in another email.  She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad [Pitt] will go also. According to The Sunday Times, which has seen the Mediapart documents, Moreno Ocampo hoped that Jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the Central African Republic with a team of US Special Forces.It was thought that their presence would then draw Kony out of his armored compound and enable the US forces to take him into custody. If these allegations are true, then it would mean that Jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of Hollywood operatives to an in-field asset of the Pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission. Truth be told,  catching Kony , as the viral 2012 slogan went, isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. In fact, the whole purpose of the CIA psy-op to  catch Kony  was to  justify  US special forces  presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, which would turn them into a  failed state belt  that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a Chinese-built bicoastal Silk Road through their resource-rich territories.The geopolitics of the Kony diversion aren t the focus of this article, so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this Hybrid War campaign. Instead, it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the  deep state , both in the propaganda and   as can now be seen   in-field operational manifestations. Thus far, it doesn t seem like any of Jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a high-profile covert mission, but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example, it s certainly possible that other  famous people  are doing something similar in serving their governments.ODD COUPLE: Joseph Kony & Angelina JolieThe Rodman-Kim CaseThe most relevant case that comes to mind is Dennis Rodman, who s the US   Kim whisperer  in passing along messages through what he calls  basketball diplomacy  but who actually functions as the best American pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive North Korean leader in person. It s been speculated for a few years already that Rodman might indeed be working for the CIA, but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either  too stupid  or that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that , but these critics never take the time to consider that Rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushed-up drug bust or something of that nature.In any case, his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur Otto Warmbier s release shortly before his death. Given that the American student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine, he probably would have been released whether Rodman came to the country or not, but it s very telling that Kim Jong-Un refused to meet with his  best friend  during this time. Incidentally, it was shortly after this that the war of words and  insult diplomacy  between the North Korean and American leaders really took off, which might have been inspired by Trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious Rodman-Kim connection because Pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up to.Although it s only speculation at this point, it would indeed explain why Trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the  madman theory  in dealing with Kim Jong-Un, as the US Intelligence Community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his North Korean counterpart. With Rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful, the US might have feared that Kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long, and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking, North Korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after Rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear test.The above narrative might sound dubious upon first read, but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that Angelina Jolie was working with the Pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to  catch Kony , which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that Dennis Rodman might have been doing similar field work for the CIA in collecting valuable personal intelligence about Kim Jong-Un.Even if the North Koreans are actually aware of what Rodman is up to nowadays, that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the  Hermit Kingdom , as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the US  deep state Continue this story at Oriental ReviewREAD MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",US_News,"October 11, 2017",century wire question pentagon power order policy charge conspiracy theory evidence practice claim hire someone fly rodman profile trouble order intelligence admission honey pot illusive existent lord resistance army actress time time pentagon bait question motivation policy rodman friendship kim agent poster woman intelligence example asset state anti production land blood honey one grounds anything propagandist role battlefield case report times media outlet court starlet organization chief prosecutor bait times article information consumer needs hand people magazine order charge celebrity news site hoard bait trap idea dinner mail chief prosecutor times times husband republic team presence compound custody propagandist class field asset pentagon mission truth deal run transnational space republic republic fact purpose presence region republic state forever incorporation silk road resource geopolitics diversion focus article author analyses war campaign relationship state propaganda field profile mission drama notch risk example people something couple rodman case rodman whisperer basketball diplomacy pair leader person rodman hire someone time rodman order drug bust something nature case visit country failure kim credit release death student attempt medicine rodman country kim un friend time war insult diplomacy trump intelligence rodman connection basketballer speculation point trump show madman theory kim un intelligence community way counterpart rodman reconnaissance mission cut kim showmanship fact missile summer rodman visit test narrative read light revelation pentagon part operation case rodman field work intelligence kim rodman nowadays mean hermit kingdom value communication state story news century wire work member
5070, WATCH: Actor Robert De Niro SLAMS ‘Totally Nuts’ Donald Trump To Cheers In Europe,"Legendary actor Robert De Niro was in Sarajevo on Saturday to accept an award in recognition of the anniversary of his character in the film Taxi Driver. But while speaking about the movie, De Niro compared his character of Travis Bickle, who has psychological issues and violent tendencies, to the Republican nominee. I don t know, it s crazy that people like Donald Trump he shouldn t even be where he is, so God help us,  he began as the crowd cheered. What he s been saying is really totally crazy, ridiculous   he is totally nuts. But I think now they are really starting to push back, the media   finally they are starting to say: Come on Donald, this is ridiculous, this is nuts, this is insane. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Donald Trump has drawn outrage from around the world with his offensive and threatening remarks ever since he entered the race for the Republican nomination in June of last year.Perhaps most worrying to people living in Sarajevo is Trump s refusal to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.But Trump s outbursts have also included claims that the upcoming presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton and his call for  Second Amendment people  to do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal judges to the Supreme Court, which is essentially a call for gun nuts to shoot her.Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose capital city is Sarajevo, is probably also concerned about Trump s ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin, especially since the Republican nominee has threatened to pull American support from NATO and Russia has been aggressive in Eastern Europe.Make no mistake, Trump is crazy and the people in Sarajevo and the rest of the world really appreciated De Niro for speaking out against Trump at a time when many Americans really do want an egomaniacal dictator wannabe in the White House.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 13, 2016",actor award recognition anniversary character film taxi driver movie character nominee people trump help crowd media insane video trump outrage world race nomination june year people refusal trump election favor call amendment people something supreme court call gun capital city trump president nominee support russia mistake trump people rest world trump time dictator house image capture
15920,DNC CHAIR PEREZ Says Trump ‘Didn’t Win’…Decides To Rewrite Constitution Without Electoral College…,"DNC chairman Tom Perez decided to create his own reality during a speech on Tuesday. This is such a Democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them. It s really pitiful that after so many months that all the Democrats have is this lie The electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters Would you want California and New York deciding our elections? That s what would happen without the electoral college. We bet that Perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it .Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez incorrectly stated  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution  during a Tuesday night speech.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));DNC Chair Tom Perez incorrectly claims  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution Posted by Fox & Friends on Friday, October 27, 2017 The Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution,  Perez said during a lecture at Indiana University Law School.  It doesn t have to be there. The Electoral College, a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states, is clearly laid out in Article II of the Constitution:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Perez has previously stated that President Donald Trump  didn t win  last November s election because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote:Following his comment, Perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact,  in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. There s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says, we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same,  Perez said.  I m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was Maryland. The main supporters of the plan put forward by Perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the Constitution, not an argument that the system doesn t exist.The comment from Perez came during a lecture honoring former Indiana Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said Bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine. VIA: WFBOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH THE CLUELESS LEFT!   If the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.   The Electoral College remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the Constitution empowered it to select presidents. Though occasionally maligned, this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the American people.The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College after much debate and compromise, but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents. Though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency, that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections: 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000.Some see the Electoral College as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few, select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the United States. Others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones.Every four years, around election time, there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct, national popular vote.The Founders  CollegeAs one of The Heritage Foundations legal experts, Hans von Spakovsky, noted in a paper on the Electoral College:  In creating the basic architecture of the American government, the Founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule. Some elements of the Electoral College, such as the indirect vote through intermediaries, were hotly debated at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal, traitor, or similar kind of heinous person. The Founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the American system, but they feared a kind of pure, unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past.The product of the Founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring, and we would be wise to leave it intact.Alexander Hamilton defended the Electoral College in Federalist 68. He argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president, but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. Hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability, and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. As students of ancient history, the Founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy, and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch, they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people. The Electoral College was a compromise, neither fully democratic nor aristocratic.The Constitution states:Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress.In addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule, the Founding Fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities. America s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states, not just the American people as an undifferentiated mass.The total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the District of Columbia included after the passage of the 23rd Amendment adds up to 538. The winner must receive a majority, or 270, of these votes to become president.The system empowers states, especially smaller ones, because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers. Farmers in Iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in New York. A more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account.The states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors. In the early days of the republic, most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors, rather than the people. But, over time, the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead. Every state has opted for popular election at least since the Civil War.Calls to AbolishModern opponents of the Electoral College argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution, criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state-by-state system of voting.Calls to fundamentally change the Electoral College reached a peak after Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the tightly contested 2000 election. Gore narrowly won the national popular vote, and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the Supreme Court stepping in was unfair.One organization, National Popular Vote, has worked toward eliminating the Electoral College through an amendment to the Constitution or a state compact. National Popular Vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country.This plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support, but Heritage s von Spakovsky has called it bad policy, based on mistaken assumptions. Swing states, he wrote,  can change from election to election, and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable. Many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote. Those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote.But this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers. Swing states change over time, and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swing-state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map.Additionally, if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.FINALLY ARE THE DEMOCRATS PROUD OF THIS DISGUSTING MAN WHO CURSES AND LIES?Read more: Daily Signal",Government News,"Oct 26, 2017",chairman reality speech thing narrative push college creation balance york college committee chairman college creation constitution night speech function id return id id net version document script chair college creation constitution college creation constitution lecture university law school college mechanism election president compromise article constitution state manner legislature thereof number number state congress president win election vote comment vote compact winner vote vote compact number bill vote person vote state law plan plan system constitution argument system comment lecture birch year assault writer report college please share president vote time college place constitution system executive people college debate compromise stability process winner vote presidency vote winner college peculiar institution vote president system power election time system vote heritage paper college architecture government state demand representation sovereignty risk minority rule college vote convention part stopgap vote people traitor kind person system kind pure democracy product compromise wise college people whole deal power president election men station deliberation combination choice system amount stability body community choice object history democracy monarch rule people college compromise constitution state manner legislature thereof number number state congress addition protection majority system power election system people mass number district passage amendment winner majority president system population york system account method days people time state vote state election war college argue institution state state system college peak democrat al gore election vote system court organization vote college amendment constitution state vote system time country plan vote level support heritage policy election election today race bill state vote winner vote population time election example state erosion map president vote time man signal
17328,IF YOU CROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY….YOU CAN NOW LAND A JOB TEACHING IN THIS STATE," We re going to have people who are bilingual teachers, and ultimately people who just want to do the right thing for the United States.  So in other words, soon it won t matter if these illegal alien teachers are able to speak english as long as they want to  do the right thing? Gov. Brian Sandoval signed a bill Wednesday that would make it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a Nevada teaching license, saying it would help meet the needs of a  new Nevada. Among the people who flanked the Republican governor as he signed AB27 was Uriel Garcia, a 22-year-old Nevada State College student and recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who was previously denied a license. He said he plans to re-apply as soon as possible to get started on his student teaching and move toward his goal of teaching 2nd grade English language learners. I want to give back to the community that gave me so much,  Garcia said.The old law allowed the state superintendent to give a teaching license to someone who is not a citizen but has a work permit only if there s a teacher shortage for a subject the person can teach. The new law, which passed the Senate and Assembly unanimously, allows those immigrants to get a teaching license if a district has a teacher shortage of any kind.The measure affects immigrants in the deferred action program, also known as DACA recipients or DREAMers. State Superintendent Dale Erquiaga said it s not clear how many new teachers the change will yield, but said his office will track that number going forward.Proponents framed the bill as a way to deal with a major teacher shortage, as well as a way to diversify the teaching force in a state with a high population of English language learners. We re going to have people who are bilingual teachers, and ultimately people who just want to do the right thing for the United States,  Garcia said.Sylvia Lazos, vice chair of the Latino Leadership Council, said the bill better reflects a changing Nevada. These laws that prohibit non-citizens from getting licensed come from another era, another time, when many states were hostile to Germans, Catholics, Irish,  Lazos said.  Modern Nevada is not protectionist, not anti-immigrant, not anti-foreigner. It s a wonderful day for Nevada to affirm that.

22231,"Uber, Google, Twitter, Netflix and Other Tech Giants File ‘Unlawful’ Immigration Retort Against Trump","21st Century Wire says A group of top Silicon Valley tech companies have filed a rare legal brief stating Trump Administration s Executive Order on immigration is discriminatory and  departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades. This legal filing follows the report Friday when a Federal Judge issued a temporarily restraining order blocking US Border Patrol, Customs and Immigration Services from enforcing President Trump s recent executive order, which bars entry to the U.S. to anyone coming from seven  majority Muslim  countries.This story and the leaked text of the legal challenge was a Washington Post exclusive on Sunday . Elizabeth Dwoskin Washington PostSilicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration.On Sunday night, Google, Facebook, Uber, Twitter, Netflix and other prominent tech companies are planning to file legal brief opposing the administration s contentious entry ban, according to people familiar with the matter.The amicus brief is expected to be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is expected to rule within a few days on an appeal by the administration after a federal judge in Seattle issued late Friday a temporary restraining order putting the entry ban on hold. The brief comes at the end of a week of nationwide protests against the plan   as well as a flurry of activity in Silicon Valley, a region that sees immigration as central to its identity as an innovation hub.Companies backing the filing also include Pinterest, Yelp, Square, Reddit, Kickstarter, Github, Glassdoor, Box, Mozilla, Dropbox, Twilio, Zynga, Medium, Pinterest, and Salesforce, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the filing was still being finalized Sunday.Notably, it doesn t appear that Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft are party to the brief. The sources cautioned that the wording of the brief   and the participants   could still change before the filing is made Sunday night.A draft of the filing says that the entry ban, which barred individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days and suspended the U.S. refugee program, is discriminatory. The Order effects a sudden, seismic shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and it departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades,  a draft obtained by The Washington Post reads.  The Order discriminates on the basis of national origin and religion. It closes our borders to the world s most vulnerable people, such as those fleeing the devastation of war. And it establishes discretionary and arbitrary rules for admission to this country, even by immigrants who have lived here lawfully for years.

Cops were called after Gaind called her own parents, back in India, to tell them she was being beaten by her husband and his family.When deputies arrived, they found the door blocked by Kalsi and heard the victim screaming inside  for the deputy to save her and her child,  the Hillsborough County Sheriff s Office said. The deputy burst in and arrested Kalsi before arresting his parents.Police report that Kalsi would regularly beat his wife and had called Jasbir and Bhupinder Kalsi asking them to fly over to help  counsel and discipline  Gaind for being  disobedient .The beatings continued, while Gaind was locked in her room and had her cell phone taken from her.It escalated on Friday, when Devbir Kalsi and his wife got into an argument.The arrest report states that Kalsi struck her  repeatedly and forcefully , and when Gaind attempted to defend herself, his parents began hitting her too, leaving bruises on her face, neck and torso.Gaind s young daughter, who was in her arms during the attack, was also struck in the face.Kalsi then allegedly held a kitchen knife to her throat and threatened to stab her.Devbir and Jasbir Kalsi may face  charges of false imprisonment, child abuse and denying access to 911,  according to the Tampa Bay Times.All three could also be deported back to India.

11120,DINGBAT MAXINE WATERS Tells Islamic Society Republicans Trying To Prevent Sharia Law From Being Enforced In America Is “Contrary To American Values…Threatens National Security” [VIDEO],"Is it simply pandering for votes, or is it possible Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters is really just a complete ignoramus? How much longer will America have to put up with the crazy antics of Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi? Will either of these women ever retire or more importantly, will their constituents ever tire of them? Many of the radical remarks made by Waters and Pelosi went under the radar because we had such a horrible president that he over-shadowed the left-wing nut-jobs California elected to represent them in Congress It s not hard to prove that Sharia Law is such a far-fetched idea when you see videos like the one below where Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters, while speaking to the Islamic Society of Orange County, CA at a town hall meeting in 2012, condemned Republicans in front of a Muslim audience for trying to make it unlawful for Sharia Law to be enforced in America. And that s supposed to be a bad thing? Maxine Waters Stood Before The Muslim Brotherhood & Openly DEFENDED & Advocated For Sharia Law. One Word: DEMENTED! pic.twitter.com/665dfp4Q21  Kevin W. (@kwilli1046) April 16, 2017As for the claim of strategy, one need only look to the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood to determine whether this is a strategy or a conspiracy theory. I ll go with what the Muslim Brotherhood has written concerning this issue. Mrs. Waters is either ignorant (without excuse) or she is complicit. In either case, this woman is not fit to hold office.She then declared that, at the time, at least thirteen states were looking to adopt legislation forbidding Sharia. What is wrong with that? We have a US Constitution. That s the law in the US. Each State has a Constitution and as far as I know, not one of them is Sharia compliant. But what happens when states try and push forward this legislation? You guessed it, the Islamists and their socialist and communist friends come out of the woodwork to try and beat it down. Just look at Oklahoma, where the federal government tried to force them to overturn anti-Sharia law and to pay Islamists $303,333!After speaking about Newt Gingrich s call for Sharia not to be recognized by any court in the United States, she smugly declared that she doesn t mind calling names and telling it like it is, but you will find absolutely no mention in her pre-written speech about the Muslim Brotherhood s goals, will you?In fact, the very document I reference speaks of:Hmmm, global Islamic State, eh? I m pretty sure Barack Obama knew about these goals before his speech the other night when he deceptively declared that the Islamic State was neither Islamic nor a state. But I digress.Islam means to change the very culture you live in and the laws you live under America. If you have any doubts, understand that a current imam at the Islamic Society of Orange County and former president of the Islamic Society of North America, Muzammil H. Siddiqi, issued this fatwa on Islamonline.net (the link has now dead, but did find it in the web archives here).-InfowarsHere is an excerpt from that document: It is true that Islam stands for the sovereignty of Allah the Almighty and Allah s rules are not limited to the acts of worship, they also include social, economic and political matters. By participating in a non-Islamic system, one cannot rule by that which Allah has commanded. But things do not change overnight. Changes come through patience, wisdom and hard work.I believe that as Muslims, we should participate in the system to safeguard our interests and try to bring gradual change for the right cause, the cause of truth and justice. We must not forget that Allah s rules have to be established in all lands, and all our efforts should lead to that direction.

19882,CALL ME “YOUR MAJESTY”: Conservative Student Takes University of Michigan’s New Gender Policy To Task…And It’s AWESOME! [Video],"My husband and I sat in a restaurant booth last night in Michigan and listened to group of college administrators talking about how best to address  sexual fluidity  in the classroom. I heard words like  binary  and  confused  and  in search of sexual identity  being thrown around as if they were the most important issues college kids are facing today. There was no mention of academics, it was all about a ensuring the faculty was in-tune and sensitive to their student s sexual identity. I was barely able to digest my food after listening to these administrators discussing what was of utmost importance to them in the college environment. I am more grateful than ever for conservative students like Grant Strobl, who are boldly standing up to the idiocy of political correctness .especially in my home state of Michigan A new policy at the University of Michigan allows students to choose their preferred pronouns  including the gender-neutral  they  and  ze    to appear on class rosters.With that in mind, one conservative student, Grant Strobl, who is also chairman of the Young Americans for Freedom board of governors, decided to troll the university administration by officially requesting his pronoun to be changed to  His Majesty. And it worked!Although Storbl says he has  no problem with students asking to be identified a certain way,  he thought it important to show just how ludicrous it is for universities to institutionalize the use of  arbitrary  pronouns and threaten disciplinary action if students and staff repeatedly fail to use them. I henceforth shall be referred to as: His Majesty, Grant Strobl.

2388, Trump’s National Security Adviser Thinks Obama Was Right About Terrorism All Along,"Donald Trump s new national security adviser thinks former-President Obama was right all along, at least when it comes to his stance on terrorism.HR McMaster, the respected army lieutenant general Trump chose to replace Michael Flynn after he resigned, told White House staff at a meeting on Thursday that he does not want to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.  You know, what Obama has been saying for years.The Guardian reports: A participant, paraphrasing McMaster, said:  He said he doesn t want to call it radical Islamic terrorism because the terrorists are, quote,  un-Islamic . McMaster, the participant said, indicated that the phrase castigates  an entire religion  and  he s not on board .At the meeting, multiple sources said, McMaster discomfited White House staffers who view the terrorist threat in those religious terms and who were said to have exchanged awkward looks with each other.Participants who attended the meeting said they were shocked by how different McMaster s views are from those of Trump, who has dropped the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  at any chance he got.During the meeting, McMaster also let it be known that he disagrees with Trump on several other points as well. He reportedly  laid out a vigorous defense of the post-second world war liberal order, calling it a guarantor of peace and economic prosperity.  Trump, on the other hand, has attacked these same longstanding foreign-policy goals repeatedly.McMaster also took a stance on Russia that is the polar opposite of his Putin loving boss.  One source said McMaster was  very clear  that he viewed Russia  as an adversary,'  the Guardian reports.Trump chose McMaster as his new national security adviser after Flynn was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had told the Russian ambassador not to worry about sanctions during a phone call that took place before Trump was sworn in.Thanks to Trump s Islamophobic policies, at least one prominent NSC staffer has already resigned. Rumana Ahmed, who worked on strategic communications, stepped down after Trump issued his Muslim ban. She said his  radical Islamic terrorism  rhetoric is really no different from the rhetoric of ISIS.Many who attended the meeting were relieved that McMasters doesn t seem to be a complete crazy person when it comes to foreign policy, but they have no idea how that will  work in context with the rest of the White House .Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 25, 2017",trump security adviser president stance terrorism army trump house staff meeting term terrorism terrorism participant phrase religion board meeting house terrorist threat meeting trump phrase terrorism chance meeting trump defense post world war order guarantor peace prosperity trump hand policy stance russia opposite source russia adversary trump security adviser ambassador phone call place trump thanks staffer trump ban terrorism rhetoric rhetoric meeting crazy person policy idea context rest house image video screen capture
15744,Je Suis HYPOCRITES: FREE SPEECH IS EMBRACED WHEN INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE MURDERED IN FRANCE…Free Speech Is Condemned (BY EVERY MEDIA OUTLET INCLUDING FOX NEWS) When Muslim Terrorists Are Killed In America [VIDEO],"Sooo when terrorists attack Je Suis Charlie, a French newspaper (who makes a living mocking religion) and kills innocent people working for the publication, the world stands tall in support of free speech. When an American hosts a  Draw Muhammed  contest in Texas and two terrorists (who were plotting to kill innocent Americans) are killed just before their plot to kill innocent Americans exercising their free speech rights, the organizer and attendants are criticized for inciting and even inviting violence. Can someone explain how this is not hypocrisy?In truth perhaps I was not  Charlie . After all, I wasn t a religion-attacking atheist. Truth to tell, in the story of Charlie Hebdo, many left out that the cartoon magazine was something that we might call a  liberal rag . It was often offensive and frequently unfunny with attacks on religion, and it didn t limit its criticism to Islam, actually attacking Christianity more. Some even believed it anti-Semitic. Deliberately, purposely provocative.And yet, even though I was none of those things, I was  Charlie . Not because I agreed with any of it. But precisely because I didn t. Because even the provocative offensive speech by assholes, to paraphrase Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic, is protected. Especially the provocative speech, the minority speech, that which offends, that which many may not like. Because the government doesn t have the right to shut down offensive speech for being offensive and neither do terrorists with AK-47s. You do not have the right to kill over a cartoon.Much of the world seemed to agree, leaders linking arms in Paris, being Charlie. Media in the U.S was also generally sympathetic, many pieces running  Je Suis Charlie  in headers.Yet here we are today, a few months later. A similar situation, where Americans exercise their First Amendment right to draw  offensive  cartoons of Muhammad. Yet where are the crowds of media saying  Je Suis Garland ? Where are the crowds of media condemning the attack on free speech? Where are the crowds of media, highlighting even just the fact that this was immediately apparent ISIS-endorsed attack on the United States?WATCH FOX NEWS  MARTHA MacCallum ATTACK EVENT ORGANIZER PAMELA GELLAR FOR ORGANIZING AN EVENT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL:https://youtu.be/mnMRFSg8i2sInstead, what we have is some, like NY Times reporter Rukmini Callamachi and even McClatchy News, in scary fashion, asking when is  provocative speech   too much  and attacking the people who held the event in Garland, more than calling out the terrorists.McClatchy even discusses whether  charges  should be brought against the organizers of the Garland event.So why the difference here for media? Because the group was one they didn t like in a state for which they didn t care with a better result than Paris because of, well, guns?And where has the Federal government s response been to an ISIS-claimed attack on American soil? President Obama hasn t even mentioned it. The press secretary made a fairly perfunctory comment about  violence  not being the proper response to expression even if offensive. One might have thought he was speaking of a video, rather than an Islamist terror attack on the United States. Again, no mention of ISIS, Islamists or terrorism. Meanwhile the President has managed to go on Letterman, to golf and to attend Democratic fundraisers.In the words of Mr. Goldberg, who gets to define what is provocative?I don t know if I would agree with everything Mr. Goldberg writes, but I would defend his right to say it, even if he were provocative. Vox calls the Garland event  hate speech . I think much of what Vox says is hate speech. Who gets to decide? I have multiple options to object to the content by protest and by pen, that is the benefit of being an American. As Mr. Goldberg notes, Iran has a Holocaust cartoon contest every year, basically catering to Holocaust deniers. Are they attacked? No, they are laughed at, they are belittled.Either we are all in or we are not. Either we believe in what we say we do, or we do not. But if we do not, if we allow  offense  or political difference to limit that protected speech, if we start to suggest as some of these writers do, what speech should or should not be  allowed , we move down the slippery slope to the rule of the mob, to the rule of the despot. In an ever-growing media state, where already, even the slightest offense is often seized on and may result in the prevailing view hounding a person from his/her job for differing, this is a frightening thought.Via: Weasel Zippers",politics,"May 5, 2015",newspaper living religion people publication world support speech draw contest plot speech organizer violence someone truth religion truth story cartoon magazine something rag religion limit criticism none speech atlantic speech minority speech government right speech right cartoon world arms media today situation amendment right media garland media attack speech media fact attack news event organizer event times news fashion speech people event garland garland event difference media group state care result government response attack soil president press secretary comment violence response one video terror attack mention terrorism president golf everything right garland event hate speech speech content protest pen benefit cartoon contest year difference speech slippery slope rule mob rule despot media state offense view person job thought weasel

We re Republicans, but we re not political people at all,  Kim Lovley told us by phone when we spoke on Tuesday afternoon. Ava was a big Trump fan, though, and had been tracking his candidacy since he announced.  She said she loved his hair and that he speaks his mind,  Kim said. And since Ava herself is a bit outspoken, that appealed.Kim arranged for the family to see Trump at an event in Farmington, N.H., about three miles from Newport, just over the state line.  When I put [the video] on Facebook, basically it was just for our friends and family to see how happy she was,  Kim said.  It wasn t for any political agenda.  When a friend helped her upload the video to YouTube, though, it blew up. Kim and her husband Jason had been fielding phone calls from members of the media all day.Neither of them has decided whom to vote for, by the way.  I d never been to a rally and a rally is not where her mother wanted to be yesterday,  Kim Lovley told us by phone when we spoke on Tuesday afternoon. But  after going to the rally, I was quite compelled by hearing what Mr. Trump had to say. I thought he gave a great rally. Ava enjoyed it, too, naturally.  Ava had the Best time!!!,  Jason Lovley reported on Facebook.  She enjoyed every minute! Twitter resurrected the viral video yesterday and tolerant hate-filled liberals have done everything from threatening the little girl to suggesting that her parents should have thrown her out onto the road. Unfortunately, for Democrats, Independent voters have been turned off by their party and the hate they spew. Every time Independent voters see reactions like these to an innocent little girl being attacked for being excited to see her favorite presidential candidate, it helps to confirm who they don t want to be associated with.Liberals wasted no time attacking the little girl:This the ugliest shit I ve ever seen https://t.co/VMr6k0H2AP  Nazanin Kavari (@Nazaninkavari) November 21, 2017Liberal Twitter users attacked her because of the color of her skin.this is singlehandedly the whitest, most unseasoned thing i've ever watched. pic.twitter.com/bPZE39wDDZ    (@iwishyouweregay) November 19, 2017Bentley Coop threatened the little 9-year old girl,  I will punch that lil girl in ha face.

6316, Another Win For The NRA: Court Rules That Cities Can’t Protect Themselves From Gun Violence,"If you ve ever thought our government is completely run by the National Rifle Association, your mind won t be changed by this article.A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled on Monday that any laws that cities or states pass to protect their citizens from gun violence are unconstitutional.The case was about three business partners in Alameda, California, who wanted to open a gun store, but they were denied a zoning permit. The court ruled in the partners  favor, saying that the right to bear arms meant the right to buy arms. If  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  is to have any force, the people must have a right to acquire the very firearms they are entitled to keep and to bear,  wrote Judge Diarmuid F. O Scannlain (a Reagan appointee) for the 2-1 majority, quoting the Second Amendment.  One cannot truly enjoy a constitutionally protected right when the state is permitted to snuff out the means by which he exercises it. All of this makes sense until you realize that cities and states can regulate virtually anything else that s sold. If a city chooses not to allow a bar or a massage parlor, that s their right. It should also be the right of a city to help mitigate crime, and if fewer guns do that, they can ban the sale of guns.Unlike gun manufacturers, though, massage parlors and bars don t have massive lobbying arms to control their every move. These graphs are a couple years old, but little has changed. Most of the NRA s bribery money goes straight into the pockets of Congressmen   236 of them Republican and 25 Democrats.You can bet that it was the NRA who propelled this case to a higher court in the first place.Judge Barry G. Silverman, named to the bench by President Bill Clinton, wrote in dissent, describing the case as  a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge. Conspicuously missing from this lawsuit is any honest-to-God resident of Alameda County complaining that he or she cannot lawfully buy a gun nearby,  Judge Silverman wrote.The most ridiculous part of this case is that the ordinance that caused the gun store to be turned away doesn t ban gun stores. It simply says they cannot be less than 500 feet from a residence. They wanted to build it 446 feet away.What this means is that as much as Republicans claim to value property rights (and life), when it comes to guns, there are no property rights. If you don t drool over the thought of guns, your right to keep your children away from guns is non-existent because in the United States, it s increasingly becoming guns before people.Featured image by Ethan Miller at Getty Images.",News,"May 17, 2016",government rifle association mind article court violence case business gun store zoning permit court right arms right arms right people arms force people right judge appointee majority amendment cannot state sense anything city bar massage parlor right right city crime sale gun massage arms move bribery money case court place judge barry bench president bill dissent case mundane dispute amendment challenge lawsuit honest resident county gun judge part case ordinance gun store ban gun residence value property life property drool thought right existent people image miller

He swore he will from now on refrain from saying  anything that can be interpreted as condoning or referencing violence. At the tender age of 69, my wife has convinced me I just can t use those harsh terms. I cannot and will not and I encourage even my friends/enemies on the left, in the Democrat and liberal world, that we have got to be civil to each other. Ted is famous for attacking Democrats with violent suggestions that could be thought of as threats. He has been particularly harsh on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He once suggested that the former president  suck on my machine gun  and referred to him as  a piece of shit.  He also disgustingly suggested that Obama should be lynched. He was very horrendous towards Hillary Clinton, especially when she was running for president. When making references to his guns he suggested she  ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless b*tch. Well, Ted, let s hope you are serious about changing your violent tune.

22093,Virginia Shooter Hodgkinson Was ‘Never Trump’ Fanatic and Devotee of Bernie Sanders,"IMAGE: Democratic Party activist and gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.21st Century WireYesterday, a crazed gunman affiliated with America s radical  progressive  and  Never Trump  movement attacked Republican members of Congress and their staff during a practice session for an annual charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia.Steve Scalise (R-LA)Among those shot were Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), the third ranking Republican in the House.In total, five people were wounded, including two police officers. All were taken to local hospitals for treatment.According to Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, Scalise was standing on second base, fielding balls during batting practice when the shooting began.Had the Capitol Police not been on the scene It would have been a massacre,  said Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  As terrible as it is, it could have been a lot worse. The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, was shot dead by police, dying later of multiple wounds.Hodgkinson, 66, is from Belleville, Illinois, was an ardent supporter of 2016 Democratic Party  presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, but also expressed a rabid hatred of conservatives and President Donald Trump as seen in his Facebook profiles and letters to newspapers. Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It s Time to Destroy Trump & Co,  and Republicans are the Taliban of the USA,  said Hodgkinson.Watch this cell phone footage of the event:However, the story appeared to be an embarrassment for Democratic Party-oriented mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC. Not surprisingly, CNN seemed to avoid any extended coverage of the shooting, opting instead to focus most of its news coverage yesterday on the Grenfell Tower fire in London. Ever since Hillary Clinton s epic defeat last November, most US mainstream media organizations have been going all-out to discredit the new president. CNN s own Kathy Griffin, a 56-year-old  comedian  sparked public outrage last month after releasing a photo and video depicting her holding the bloodied head of President Trump in an ISIS-style video.Other liberal media sources are attempting to frame the attack as a  gun control  story, rather than a politically-motivated act of domestic terrorism.The following is a live debate which aired on RT International on Wednesday night, featuring 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen, Tighe Barry from Code Pink, and  Lionel  a frequent contributor on RT America.

6277, Donald Trump Humiliates Chris Christie AGAIN And It’s Worse Than Ever Before (VIDEO),"Chris Christie s strange loyalty to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has been questioned since the day he pledged his unwavering support to the business mogul. However, every time Trump insults or embarrasses the New Jersey governor, Christie loses even more of the public s respect. This most recent incident further proves that not even Trump has an ounce of respect for Christie, and is really just using him as a prop to make his campaign events more entertaining for his audience.Previously, Trump has humiliated Christie by basically holding him hostage on stage after the NJ governor endorsed him, and dismissing him like an unwanted child during a Tennessee rally by telling him to  get on that plane and go home . This latest incident just adds even more insult to injury. At a campaign event specifically aimed to help Christie get out of his $200,000 debt from his failed campaign   which is embarrassing enough to admit   Trump decided to make matters worse by teasing Christie about something he s always been sensitive about   his weight.Trump had gone on a rant about Nabisco moving factories to Mexico, and mentioned that he was done eating Oreos. Desperately searching for a punchline, Trump looked at Christie, pointed his little index finger at him and said: Neither is Chris! You re not eating Oreos anymore! The crowd erupted into awkward laughter and Trump tried to  soften the blow  by repeating the joke and bringing himself into the equation. No more Oreos, for either of us, Chris! Don t feel bad! For either of us! You can watch this embarrassing moment unfold moment below:To make matters even worse, Trump also announced,  So you know Chris paid off his entire campaign debt tonight  at the rally, clearly rubbing salt in the wound he continually keeps opening. If Christie had any self-respect after the massive failure of his own presidential campaign, you can be sure that it ll be demolished by the time Trump s campaign is over.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",loyalty nominee trump day support business time trump jersey governor respect incident ounce respect prop campaign audience trump stage governor child rally plane home incident insult campaign event debt campaign trump something weight trump rant trump index finger crowd laughter trump blow joke equation feel moment moment trump campaign debt tonight rally salt wound self respect failure campaign time trump campaign image spencer

9230,THE LIST of 34 House Republicans DEMANDING Permanent AMNESTY For Obama’s DACA “Kids”,"Who wants to deport  Dreamers ? Not many people, it turns out. Even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal. That s true even though a lot of what s said about the DACA recipients is PR-style hooey.For example, it s often said   indeed, former President Barack Obama just recently said   that the approximately 800,000 of them were  brought to this country by their parents.  Well, many were. But that s not required to qualify as a protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient under the various plans, including Obama s. You just have to have entered the country illegally before age 16. You could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes. You re still a  Dreamer! Likewise, we re told DACA recipients are college-bound high school grads or military personnel. That s an exaggeration. All that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative,  including online courses and English-as-a-second-language classes. Under Obama s now-suspended program, you didn t even have to stay enrolled.Compared with the general population, DACA recipients are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro- Dreamer  groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most DACA recipients are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans.The DACA recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They re valedictorians. They re first responders. They re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If DACA recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally, these are the poster children for the poster children.  Chicago Tribune34 Republicans in Congress are not about to let the pesky facts about Obama s  Dreamers  get in the way of lobbying Speaker Ryan to grant them permanent citizenship.Numbers USA reports  Thirty-four Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for passage of a permanent DACA amnesty before the end of the year. Reps. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led the effort.While the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a DACA amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must-pass spending bill, they don t insist on any other immigration-related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory E-Verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to Chain Migration.The letter reads:Dear Speaker Ryan,We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients   young people brought to America through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status.Since DACA s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution.We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities.While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do.Here s the list of 34 Republicans who need to be drained from the swamp:Rep. Scott Taylor (VA-2) Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA-4) Rep. Mia Love (UT-4) Rep. Mark Amodei (NV-2) Rep. David Valadao (CA-21) Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-8) Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-8) Rep. Mike Coffman (CO-6) Rep.

Already, British police forces have been conducting exercises on how to deal with various types of terrorist attack. But the EU report claims that government should  consider publicly addressing the possibility of terrorist attack using chemical, biological, radiological or even nuclear materials .The report, ISIL/Da esh and  non-conventional  weapons of terror warns:  At present, European citizens are not seriously contemplating the possibility that extremist groups might use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) materials during attacks in Europe. Under these circumstances, the impact of such an attack, should it occur, would be even more destabilising. Rob Wainwright, head of Europol said after the attacks on Paris:  We are dealing with a very serious, well-resourced, determined international terrorist organisation that is now active on the streets of Europe. This represents the most serious terrorist threat faced in Europe for 10 years. Mr Wainwright warned that ISIS had serious capabilities in terms of resources and manpower.

23448,FBI Arrest Cliven Bundy at Portland Airport – Charged with Federal Conspiracy,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireCliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher at the center of the federal standoff in Bunkerville in 2014, was arrested by FBI agents at around 10pm Wednesday evening as he touched down at Portland International Airport. Bundy, 74 yrs old, of Bunkerville, Nevada, was taken to Oregon s Multnomah County detention center and charged with  conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer    the same federal felony charge made two weeks ago against of his two sons, Ammon and Ryan Bundy.According to Oregon Live, Cliven Bundy,  also faces weapons charges,  dating back to the original standoff in April 2014.READ THE FULL FEDERAL COMPLAINT AGAINST CLIVEN BUNDY HERE. Police Mug Shot: Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy was arrested in Portland last night.Bundy s dramatic arrest came as he was planning to meet up with staunch Bundy supporter, Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, for a Q & A press conference in Portland scheduled for early Thursday morning, presumably to advocate for the Bundy sons and others currently under federal incarceration, and to help mediate a peaceful resolution for the remaining 4 occupiers still held-up at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge outside of Burns, Oregon.The timeline of these events is particularly interesting. Before Cliven Bundy touched down in Portland, Fiore (photo, left) had already arrived in town, but was immediately confronted with a breaking situation on Wednesday afternoon, where reports indicate that there were likely dozens of heavily armed federal tactical and state SWAT members positioned at various points around the perimeter of the occupied federal refuge office building. On Wednesday evening, law enforcement appeared to have decided to make their move to end the occupation by re-taking the protest site and remove its occupants. Fiore then headed to Burns while engaged in a 4 hour-long phone call with the protesters live-streamed on YouTube with nearly 60,000 listeners on the call.Clearly, the FBI had plenty of foreknowledge of Cliven Bundy and Michele Fiore s potentially explosive media spectacle scheduled for this morning. FBI agents appear to have preempted this national (and global) press event by Bundy and Fiore, quickly moving on the protest, and then taking Cliven Bundy out of the equation, or  off the street , as it were. This chain of events over the last 24 hours indicates that the federal government had made decisive moves at key moments   in order to temporarily control the media and political narratives, and by extension, the course of events which have followed. That reality was echoed by Portland attorney, Mike Arnold, currently representing Ammon Bundy, who said earlier today: It s terribly unfortunate the timing of his arrest, given all the progress Assemblywoman Fiore made this evening. In addition to Fiore and Cliven Bundy arriving in Oregon this week, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, posted on Facebook that he had been talking with the four holdouts for a week,  at their request and at the request of the FBI , and was said to be heading for Burns to witness a peaceful resolution. Early on Thursday, Graham stated the following:  I am on my way there  Please keep them, law enforcement officials, and all involved in your prayers, that everyone will be safe. Presently, federal forces are still at the gates of the refuge, with occupiers still inside. According to the Oregonian, the remaining occupiers are 27-year-old David Fry, the man running the refuge protest YouTube livestream, along with married couple Sean and Sandy Anderson, and one other man known by the name of Jeff Banta. It s not completely clear if all the occupants are armed, and there have been some mixed messages over the last two weeks as to what their exact intentions were, and what concessions were possible through negotiations.UPDATE: 4 holdouts all in FBI custody as occupation endsIn an overwhelming show of force, the FBI have surrounded the small one story detached Malheur office building with MRAP armored vehicles and other assets, including multiple surveillance drones positioned overhead. It s not known exactly how many federal agents are in position at the refuge and the surrounding area, but based on similar events, the number could be at least 300, not including state and other law enforcement agents.At the end of January, a team of federal and state agents shot and killed the protest s spokesman, Arizona rancher, Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, in what can only be described as a well-organize, federal and state ambush, involving dozens of vehicles and armed agents (including snipers) positioned along an isolated rural stretch of  Oregon highway 395. The mainstream media are still disingenuously referring to the event as a  traffic stop incident    in what appears to be a well-coordinated PR effort to minimize any accusations of over-reach on the part of the federal agencies.The left-wing arm of the media, and a virtual army of anti-Bundy activists online will certainly be celebrating this latest development as a  government victory .With the iconic face of the public lands issue, Cliven Bundy, now in custody, this will either stir the burgeoning  Constitutionalist  movement, or it will further demoralize it.Cliven Bundy is expected to appear in a Portland federal court this afternoon.Watch this space.READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"February 11, 2016",century rancher center standoff evening airport detention center conspiracy officer felony charge sons bundy bundy standoff complaint bundy shot bundy night bundy arrest supporter press conference morning sons incarceration resolution wildlife refuge bundy photo town situation afternoon state swat perimeter refuge office building law enforcement move occupation protest site hour phone call call plenty foreknowledge bundy media spectacle morning press event bundy protest equation street chain government order media extension course reality attorney mike bundy today timing arrest progress evening addition week franklin son evangelist week request request resolution graham way law enforcement everyone refuge year man refuge protest couple man name jeff custody occupation show force story office building assets surveillance position refuge area number state law enforcement end team state shot protest spokesman rancher well state ambush stretch highway media event traffic stop incident effort reach part left arm media army development government victory face issue custody movement bundy court afternoon watch space standoff news century wire

The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets.Curiel s order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November.Trump, who previously questioned whether Curiel s Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump s support for building a wall on the Mexican border, said Friday that Curiel  happens to be, we believe, Mexican.  Trump called the judge a  hater of Donald Trump  who had  railroaded  him in the case. I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself. I think it s a disgrace that he is doing this,   Trump said.Trump University was started in 2004 to offer courses in entrepreneurship under the Trump brand.

17924,"LIFETIME VICTIMS of Injustice, MICHELLE and BARACK OBAMA Are Looking To Buy $15 Million Piece Of Land From Caroline Kennedy On Martha’s Vineyard","Remember when Michelle Obama told an adoring crowd at the DNC Convention how she had to suffer through living in the White House that was  built by slaves ?Remember in 2015, when President Barack Obama used the  n  word during an interview where he talked about racism in America, and actually tried to convince the host that blacks are victims of racism today, as much as they were 200-300 years ago.Barack Obama invoked the most charged racial slur in American society during an interview published on Monday, as part of an argument that while the US has made great strides toward equality, racism still pervades the nation. Racism, we are not cured of it. And it s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not,  Obama told comedian Marc Maron, who interviewed the president for his popular podcast on Friday and released their conversation online on Monday. It s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior. The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives,  he continued,  that casts a long shadow and that s still part of our DNA that s passed on. Watch:Well, it appears that lifetime victims, Barack and Michelle Obama have finally broken the chains of oppression that have been holding them back since they moved from their mansion in Chicago in 2008, to the White House, and then to their multi-million pad in DC, as they set their sites on 2 separate pieces of VACANT land on Martha s Vineyard valued at $12 million and $15 million each.Word around the island is that the Obamas, who ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha s Vineyard   Harvard professors Henry Louis  Skip  Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few   and they would like to own a place of their own on the island.The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused  up island,  looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented  up island,  including for a two-week stay this summer.)No one s talking, least of all realtors, but we re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market.Both are still available   but they don t come cheap. Sotheby s International Realty is listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million.The listing broker, George Ballantyne of Gibson Sotheby s International Realty, declined to talk to us. The properties appear on multiple sites, including Hancock Real Estate and Sand Piper Realty, which are both located on the Vineyard.

6791," Israelis Throw ‘Death To Arabs’ Rally, Thousands Attend (VIDEO/TWEETS)","The state of Israel has been able to cover up its racism to the world quite effectively over the years through the use of propaganda and a pretense to peace with the Palestinians. Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.

7890, Ben Carson Tells CNN He Thinks His Campaign Might Be A Scam,"During an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson wondered aloud if his presidential campaign is all a big scam.During the interview, a laughing Carson told CNN s Poppy Harlow that his campaign had employed people who didn t really seem to understand finances. A moment later, as if the possibility had just dawned on him for the very first time, Carson added,  or maybe they did maybe they were doing it on purpose. It s impossible to tell if Carson is extremely stupid or extremely good at acting stupid. Either way, he would be an extremely terrifying president.As Addicting Info reported in January, Ben Carson s campaign staff started jumping ship on New Year s Eve, with more than 20 of former staffers resigning in a 24 hour period.The resignations followed months of accusations that the candidate s campaign is little more than a money-making scheme, which also doubles as a promotional tour to sell books.The fact that Carson s campaign has been raising money hand over fist, but investing very little in actual campaign activities, was just one indicator that Carson s presidential campaign was a hoax.As New York Magazine pointed out months ago, the Carson campaign is  structured much more like a scamming venture than a political one. As evidence, New York Magazine also reported, An astronomical 69 percent of his fund-raising totals are spent on more fund-raising. (Bernie Sanders, by contrast, spends just 4 percent of his intake on fund-raising.) In addition to direct mail, Carson seems to have undertaken a massive phone-spamming operation. Spending most of your money to raise more money is not a good way to get elected president, but it is a good way to build a massive list of supporters that can later be monetized. Perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for Armstrong Williams, the figure running the Carson  campaign,  is  business manager,  as opposed to  campaign manager.  It does suggests that Carson is engaged in a for-profit venture. Even more telling, a significant number of the companies hired to run Carson s costly telemarketing and direct-mail campaigns just happen to be run by friends and family members of staffers.Then there s the fact that, while Carson s fundraising totals surpass that of every other GOP candidate, his polling numbers are terrible.While Carson told CNN that  things are much better  with his campaign now, according to the Atlantic, not much has changed.The campaign is still spending huge amounts of money on raising more money, diverting millions to businesses like TMA Direct, which is owned by Mark Murray, one of Carson s top fundraisers.According to the Atlantic, Murray has also long worked with Eleventy and InfoCision, two Akron, Ohio-based companies. InfoCision has been implicated in past scams. Eleventy s president is chief marketing officer for Carson. Communication Management Source is run by Joanne Parker, whose husband Dean Parker departed the campaign in December. According to the latest financial disclosures, the Carson campaign paid Eleventy Marketing $4.8 million in the last quarter, while InfoCision got a whopping $2.4 million. Communication Management Source didn t make out quite as well, being paid $1.3 million.It s almost impossible to believe that Carson doesn t know whether or not his campaign is a scam to bilk low-information conservative voters out of millions of dollars.His weird, out-of-place laughter, combined with his sad attempts to convince the public that it s all behind him now, are pretty good indicators that he s more than aware that his campaign is a hoax.With the money still rolling in, though, Carson is clearly going to try to keep the scam going for as long as he possibly can.Image from wikipedia",News,"February 24, 2016",appearance candidate ben campaign scam interview laughing campaign people moment possibility time purpose way president ben campaign staff ship year hour period candidate campaign money scheme tour fact campaign money hand fist campaign indicator campaign hoax york magazine campaign venture evidence york magazine percent fund raising fund sanders contrast percent intake fund raising addition mail phone operation money money way president way list giveaway title figure campaign business manager campaign manager profit venture number mail family fact polling campaign campaign money money millions direct mark top president officer communication management source parker husband dean parker campaign campaign marketing quarter communication management source campaign scam information millions weird place laughter public campaign hoax money scam image

4938," WATCH: Hillary CRUSHES Trump On Kimmel, Will Draw On Elementary School Experience To Debate Him","Hillary Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night and absolutely killed it.Jimmy Kimmel has spent a lot of time on his show mocking Donald Trump, so it was only natural for him to talk to the Democratic nominee about him.The first segment of the interview was dedicated entirely to discussing the imploding Republican nominee.Right after Hillary sat down Kimmel remarked that the crowd was cheering quite enthusiastically for the  co-founder of ISIS,  which drew laughter from the former Secretary of State, who replied that the claim was one of the crazier things that Trump has said during his campaign.And with all the ridiculous things Trump has said on the campaign trail, Kimmel asked if she gets upset. I don t get upset anymore,  Clinton said,  because I d be upset all the time. Hillary pointed out that Trump s rhetoric is music to the terrorists  ears because they would love to influence our elections in any way they can. It also gives them advertising material to use to draw new recruits.Considering Trump s unpredictability and insanity throughout his run for the presidency, Kimmel wondered how Hillary is preparing to debate him, which drew a very interesting and hilarious response. I watched a lot of his debates during the primaries and he insulted all of his opponents, he insulted all the moderators, he insulted, I guess about 80 percent of the American people and the rest of the world  You gotta be prepared for all the wacky stuff that comes at you. I am drawing on my experience in elementary school. Kimmel also asked Hillary about her health and the claims of Trump and his team that she is unfit to serve because she is not well. Hillary compared Trump s attack to a tabloid story, remarking that the National Enquirer once said she would be dead in six months, but that was a long time ago and she s still full of life. I don t know why they are saying this,  Clinton said.  I think on the one hand, it s part of the wacky strategy. Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. I don t go around questioning Donald Trump s health. Kimmel then challenged her to open a pickle jar to prove her fitness, and she opened it.Hillary then admitted that she had hoped to be running against someone more serious and qualified to do the job of President of the United States. I would prefer to be running against somebody who I thought was qualified to be president and temperamentally fit to be commander-in-chief I don t think we ve ever been confronted with somebody who we see right now in the midst of this election is unqualified and temperamentally unfit. Hillary went on to name three Republicans who have endorsed her and praised their decision to put country first.And at the end of the interview, she read some mean quotes uttered by Donald Trump. But she refused to read the one of Trump saying he would date his own daughter.This was an excellent interview for Hillary Clinton. She dispelled the rampant falsehoods being pushed by Trump and his minions while at the same time showing the American people that she is a positive person who is qualified for the office she seeks.

12307,TRIGGERED? POLICE OFFICER Kicked Out Of Event For Wearing Uniform,"The city s first transgender police officer was kept out of an event at the San Diego LGBT Community Center because she was wearing her uniform.The Transgender Day of Awareness, an annual event to honor those who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence, was held Nov. 17 in the Hillcrest neighborhood. Officer Christine Garcia, who transitioned last year, helped plan the event and was part of the Police Department security detail that watched over a commemorative march down University Avenue. After the march, when Garcia tried to enter the event as a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, she was asked to leave because her uniform could upset others in attendance. When leaders at the center learned what had happened, they apologized to Garcia and San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman.  We do not wish to ever make any community member feel unwelcome   these officers are valued members of our community,  Delores Jacobs, chief executive officer of the LGBT center, said in a statement. Jacobs said the occurrence was a misunderstanding of the center s existing policy of inclusion, which seeks to acknowledge the concerns that members of the community may have without excluding others. Leaders have reviewed the policy with its staff since the event.  While we need to support those that are uncomfortable and honor their reactions to valid and understandable difficult previous experiences, we also need to explain that  our LGBTQ San Diego police liaisons are a valued part of our community,  Jacobs wrote. Longtime LGBTQ activist, City Commissioner Nicole Murray-Ramirez, said the incident was an outrage.  Any officer, be they gay or straight, should be welcomed into our community center in uniform,  he said.  They protect our community and neighborhoods and make San Diego a better place.Read more: San Diego Tribune",politics,"Nov 24, 2016",city police officer event community center uniform day awareness event violence officer year event part police department security detail march university avenue march event member gay queer community uniform attendance center police chief community member community officer center statement occurrence misunderstanding center policy inclusion community policy staff event police part community activist city commissioner incident outrage officer community center uniform community place tribune
5067, Leaked Footage Of Johnny Depp Shows How Aggressive He Was To Amber Heard (VIDEO),"Shortly after Amber Heard revealed that she suffered abuse from a partner, who happened to be famed actor Johnny Depp, many people quickly decided to claim that she was lying. They didn t want to dare believe that such a beloved actor and character on film could be so abusive in real life.Many even said that seeing Heard out with friends and smiling days after she reported the abuse was proof of her lying. As if she s supposed to stay in hiding and never smile again. God forbid she go out with friends and be happy away from a destructive relationship.Well, it seems Heard most definitely wasn t lying as TMZ just released footage that she secretly took of Depp being intoxicated, slamming around, kicking doors, drinking heavily in the morning with very distressing and reactive behavior towards her. Then, when he notices she s recording, getting increasingly angry, grabbing the camera, and then that s when it goes dark.Of course, TMZ stated: Sources connected with Johnny tell TMZ   the video is  heavily edited  and there are portions where Amber is seen smiling and egging him on. The sources add the video was a complete set up by Amber. However, here s the thing, the video was shot in one shot, there doesn t seem to be anywhere it could be edited.It s important to remember to not make a villain of a victim as it is what seems to be happening with Heard because the alleged abuser is a beloved actor. We need to listen to her, especially before this happens to anyone else.Here s the video via TMZ.Video evidence just surfaced of Johnny Depp being extremely aggressive towards Amber Heard, smashes wine glass pic.twitter.com/JgkNDXLUY6  Pop Crave (@PopCrave) August 13, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 13, 2016",abuse partner actor people actor character film life days abuse proof lying forbid relationship well footage morning behavior camera course tell video amber video amber thing video shot seem villain victim abuser actor anyone video video evidence towards glass pic twitter pop august image video screen capture
21121,IS GOP ESTABLISHMENT Responsible For Pro-Amnesty Spanish Version Of Nikki Haley’s GOP Response To Obama’s SOTU? [Video],"This is a very big development. We all knew the GOP establishment has been pandering to pro-amnesty corporations and the Chamber of Commerce, but this is a new low, even for the GOP establishment There is a bigger controversy about to break wide-open that s potentially far more significant than Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell approving Nikki Haley s non-subtle attack on GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. That bigger controversy is the Spanish version of the GOP State of the Union rebuttal containing an  amnesty pledge .As this is written, Governor Nikki Haley is trying to get out ahead of the building expose . Haley just gave a DC press conference claiming she does not support  amnesty ; however, against her earlier admission of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell approving her script   the Spanish version must have held similar approvals.Governor Haley gave the English version, Miami Representative and party-insider Mario Diaz-Barlat delivered it in Spanish.ENGLISH:SPANISH:Here s a (paragraph by paragraph) comparison as translated by the Miami Herald (emphasis mine):  English (Via Haley): No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.Spanish (Via Diaz-Barlat): No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love the United States should ever feel unwelcome in this country. It s not who we are.  English: At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can t do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined.Spanish: At the same time, it s obvious that our immigration system needs to be reformed. The current system puts our national security at risk and is an obstacle for our economy.  English: We must fix our broken immigration system. That means stopping illegal immigration. And it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. Just like we have for centuries.Spanish: It s essential that we find a legislative solution to protect our nation, defend our borders, offer a permanent and human solution to those who live in the shadows, respect the rule of law, modernize the visa system and push the economy forward.  English: I have no doubt that if we act with proper focus, we can protect our borders, our sovereignty and our citizens, all while remaining true to America s noblest legacies.Spanish: I have no doubt that if we work together, we can achieve this and continue to be faithful to the noblest legacies of the United States.It is important to remember the backdrop to this current dual narrative (one the GOPe leadership want to say publicly and one they wish to keep hidden).Back in June 2014 Speaker John Boehner was only two days away from calling up the vote on the Senate  gang-of-eight  amnesty bill, when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was defeated in the Virginia Primary.Mario Diaz Balart along with Paul Ryan and Luis V. Gutierrez were in secret negotiations throughout the spring/summer of 2014 planning the pathway for comprehensive immigration reform.

12641,BREAKING: HILLARY CAMPAIGN Planned Fake “GRASSROOTS” Millennial Movement To Steal Bernie Followers,"Wikileaks released another email showing how phony Hillary s campaign has been from the start. Americans should never believe the polls. Hillary has NEVER given Americans a reason to want to get behind her. Its why she and her camp, with the help of the media are constantly manufacturing what appears to be (but really is not) support for her candidacy. The most HILL-larious part of this whole story is that Hillary s camp planned to use the young Tallahassee Mayor, Andrew Gillum to launch Hillary s fake  grassroots  group after he gave a speech at the DNC about how  trust  in government  can be restored! Here is the attachment to an email addressed to Hillary s campaign manager, John Podesta:CONCEPT PAPEROBJECTIVE:Mobilize young voter participation for the 2016 election in support of Hillary ClintonSTRATEGY: Use young elected officials and entertainers to build a  grassroots  movement of under 40 voters as a vehicle to migrate support for Bernie into activism for Hillary.OPERATIONAL GOALS: Identify young elected officials (YEOs)across the country to become the face of a new organization that is focused on a progressive future. These young elected officials would promote both the organization, the ideas embraced by it and the need for civic engagement with an immediate focus on involvement in the 2016 election. They would be seen as the faces of a new progressivist movement that combines noble goals with political realities resulting in real progress.The organization would be built around a group of ideas or concepts as opposed to parties or individuals. The ideas should always reinforce the message that the under 40 generation needs to engage politically to shape their own future. Building the New Economy, Creating an Empowerment Society, Transitioning to a Sustainable World, Tearing Down Barriers are all phrases which might be included in the messaging. Support for the Hillary would be included in the messaging but initially as tangential to it, i.e.  if you support these things then there really isn t another choice but her . Over time the messaging would transition more into the actionable item of involvement in the campaign and support for its efforts.The organization should be built around a Ready for Hillary type model: grassroots driven, limited engagement of the principal, both an organizational and small dollar fundraising component, centered on-line and in venues frequented by under 40 s   college campuses, with a big emphasis on community colleges, nightclubs, athletic events, etc.The group should be branded separately from the campaign so people who engage with it feel like they created and own it as opposed to feeling swallowed by an organization that defeated them. A distinct name, artwork, website, spokespeople etc would be desired.TACTICS:The program should be launched initially in one state and then expand out. It should be seen as growing and spreading. We want people calling and asking if they can set one up in their state as opposed to forcing the model on them.The YEO s in that state would announce the formation of their group stating theirs goal to help elect a progressive President and engage young people with a goal of making sure their voices are heard and they are ready to participate. It should feel almost like  we got together and decided to do this on our own . Depending on the organizational model, they could say they all support Hillary and are doing it to help but there are bigger and longer term objectives here, etc. Ideally you could say something like the campaign is providing limited resources but has agreed any funds you raise will be directed into youth outreach.They would then do a series of event which would be a college campus  town hall  during the day and a club type event that night. The  town hall  with students would be informal with talking with students about goals, dreams, political reality, how government can make things happen, how sometimes it doesn t, etc. It would end in a pitch for them to become engaged politically to build a progressive future. Later in the evening, these YEO s would attend and speak briefly at a campaign event in a bar/club featuring a local DJ or entertainer and has a nominal contribution as part of attendence. The campus event will be used to build buzz for the second event as well as the campaign itself. As momentum grows for the organization, bigger names would be brought in for the  town hall  events as well as bigger artists for the  club  events, furthering the momentum. Eventually, HRC/WJC/CVC as well as VP and Spouse would be integrated into these events but it should be seen as them coming to the  movement  as opposed to them trying to take it over.RECOMMENDATIONS:This program be launched by Mayor Andre Gillum in Florida. Goal would be early AprilTarget is to have 10 people at launchDo events in Miami, Palm Beach, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando in April.Convene a group of National YEO s in May/June to discuss their involvement.Have organization functioning in 5 battlegound states by June 1   Florida, Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina?",politics,"Oct 24, 2016",campaign start reason camp help media support candidacy part story camp mayor group speech trust government attachment campaign manager podesta concept mobilize voter participation election support use movement vehicle support activism country face organization future organization need engagement focus involvement election progressivist movement progress organization group message generation needs future economy society world support choice time item involvement campaign support organization type model engagement dollar component line college emphasis community group campaign people organization name program state people state model yeo state formation group goal president people goal depending model term something campaign funds youth series event college campus town hall day club type event night town hall reality government pitch future evening yeo briefly campaign event bar club entertainer contribution part campus event buzz event campaign momentum organization town hall club momentum spouse movement program mayor goal people palm beach convene group yeo involvement organization june colorado
2514, WATCH: Kieth Olbermann DESTROYS Trump For Mishandling Intelligence Way Worse Than Hillary Ever Did,"Donald Trump continues to be a national embarrassment who is making our country less safe.At Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, Trump threw a party for his friends and random guests. And as that party went on, Trump was receiving sensitive information from aides as pictures were being taken all around him. Someone even managed to take a picture of and with the guy carrying the nuclear briefcase that the president needs to order a nuclear strike.Trump s lax attitude when it comes to national security intel is particularly alarming and hypocritical since he repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of being irresponsible because of her emails.And Kieth Olbermann trashed Trump for it and pointed out that if Hillary Clinton has done what Trump is doing she would have been impeached immediately by the Republican-controlled Congress. It boggles the mind,  Olbermann began.  The president of the United States was reportedly receiving information vital to the security of the nation about a provocative North Korea missile test in a golf club restaurant. Not merely in a setting of insecurity, but surrounded by and photographed by people who could be anything from gawking tourists to Russian agents. And if this cannot get worse, the president couldn t be bothered to even leave the dinner to go to a slightly more private place where random passers-by cannot take souvenir pictures of a security briefing so they can post them later to Facebook. Oblermann went on to note that Trump staffers were trying to read the information handed to Trump via the flashlights on their cell phones, which can be hacked and used to transmit what they are reading to our enemies without them even knowing about it.Olbermann then destroyed Trump s hypocrisy. Trump slandered Hillary Clinton. You could argue Trump beat Hillary Clinton on charges on insecure handling of emails. Nothing she was ever accused of, nothing, comes close to this debacle near Trump s version of the Bushwood country club during the Korean missile crisis If Clinton had done just this, the Republicans would have impeached her before sunrise. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is reckless with our national security. His guests literally had a front row seat to the information he was being given. Any one of his guests could have easily been a spy from an enemy nation and they would now have information to use against us. This is a serious breach that Republicans in Congress must take seriously and that means they need to impeach Trump.Our national security is not a game. It s life and death for every American citizen.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 15, 2017",trump embarrassment country mar weekend trump party party trump information someone picture guy president order strike trump attitude security trump trump republican congress mind president information vital security nation north missile test golf club restaurant setting insecurity people anything cannot president dinner place random cannot security trump information cell trump hypocrisy trump beat insecure handling nothing nothing debacle trump version bushwood country club missile crisis sunrise video trump security row seat information spy enemy nation information breach congress security game life death citizen image
4207, Meet The Black Man Donald Trump Tried To Murder (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described  law and order  candidate in the 2016 presidential election. But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars. The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger). Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released. They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys  execution. Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered. Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against Trump. They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened? Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park. That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking. Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety. Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime. It is his go-to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 13, 2016",trump self law order candidate election men reality star week trump park men men justice system woman park jogger man crime evidence court judgment damages incarceration trump page ad trial execution men salaam trump incitement salaam salaam trump page ad park era impetus mob justice ad trump phone somebody society drug park type mob justice trump men part pattern nominee attitude towards safety police brutality movement trump length stop frisk city crime go position rhetoric people image capture
5983, Reagan’s Son SLAMS Trump: If My Father Was Alive He Wouldn’t Vote For GOP Nominee (TWEETS),"Yet another conservative is openly expressing his support for the #NeverTrump movement   and it s none other than Michael Reagan, the son of former President Ronald Reagan.On Monday, Michael took to Twitter to tell his followers that he would not be voting for The Donald on Tuesday, and that he firmly believes that his father would also refrain from voting for the business mogul if he was still alive. Of course, Reagan was immediately attacked by Trump s die-hard followers, who tried to argue his claim that the former President wouldn t have backed Trump if he were here today. Here s how that went:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterReagan is one of an overwhelming amount of Republicans abandoning the GOP solely because Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. No one can forget that when Trump was announced as the leader in the GOP race, conservatives all across the country reacted by burning and tearing up their voter registration cards. In some cases, GOP voters left their affiliation with the party altogether.Reagan has spoken against Trump before, with the assertion that his father would not approve of the business mogul being the GOP nominee. A few months ago, during an interview with Newsmax, Reagan slammed Trump s campaign, and the Republicans who support it: My father would be appalled by what s going on with this campaign. Are you a Trump Republican, or are you a Reagan Republican? Because you cannot be both. The words of Reagan s son are particularly humorous considering that Trump has compared himself to Reagan before, when he claimed he evoke[s] the name Ronald Reagan.  Trump said on CBS s Face The Nation: Ronald Reagan was a fairly liberal Democrat, and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative. And he was not a very conservative person, but he was pretty conservative. And he ended up being a great president. Clearly, no one else sees the similarities besides The Donald, and many GOPers   such as Reagan s son   don t have any faith in Trump to be  a great president .Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"June 7, 2016",support movement son president father business course trump claim president trump today amount trump nominee one trump leader race country voter registration affiliation party trump assertion father business interview campaign father campaign republican son trump name trump nation democrat person president one son faith trump president image
14400,WHOA! CONSERVATIVE MEDIA Was In Cahoots With Rubio To Push Immigration Reform,"This is a blockbuster discovery that nails conservative media for being in cahoots with Rubio and other high level politicians in their support of amnesty. The Gang of Eight Bill was the political football being tossed around by Democrats and then Rubio joined in to make it a bipartisan effort. The account of what happened between politicians and media is a perfect example of what s got Americans so ticked off at Washington and the media. It s very obvious that the media was a big reason for Obama s two-term presidency and now we have FOX News selling its soul for Rubio in the 2016 election. The article below will open your mind to the political manipulation happening all the time between media and Washington- it s a stunner:A few weeks after Senator Marco Rubio joined a bipartisan push for an immigration overhaul in 2013, he arrived alongside Senator Chuck Schumer at the executive dining room of News Corporation s Manhattan headquarters for dinner.Their mission was to persuade Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the media empire, and Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of its Fox News division, to keep the network s on-air personalities from savaging the legislation and give it a fighting chance at survival.Mr. Murdoch, an advocate of immigration reform, and Mr. Ailes, his top lieutenant and the most powerful man in conservative television, agreed at the Jan. 17, 2013, meeting to give the senators some breathing room.But the media executives, highly attuned to the intensifying anger in the Republican grass roots, warned that the senators also needed to make their case to Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio, who held enormous sway with the party s largely anti-immigrant base.The dinner at News Corporation headquarters   which has not been previously reported   and the subsequent outreach to Mr. Limbaugh illustrate the degree to which Mr. Rubio served as the chief envoy to the conservative media for the group supporting the legislation. The bill would have provided a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants along with measures to secure the borders and ensure that foreigners left the United States upon the expiration of their visas.It is a history that Mr. Rubio is not eager to highlight as he takes on Donald J. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, who has made his vow to crack down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.Those discussions of just a few years ago now seem of a distant era, when, after the re-election of President Obama, momentum was building to overhaul the nation s immigration system.The senators embarked on a tour of editorial boards and newsrooms, and Mr. Rubio was even featured as the  Republican savior  on the cover of Time magazine for his efforts to change immigration laws. He already was being mentioned as a 2016 presidential contender.Now Mr. Trump has become the Republican leader in national polls by picking fights with Mr. Ailes and offending the Latino voters whom Mr. Rubio had hoped to bring into the Republican fold. And while Mr. Rubio ultimately abandoned the bipartisan legislation in the face of growing grass-roots backlash and the collapse of the conservative media truce, he, and to a certain degree Fox News, are still paying for that dinner. Rubio Discusses Borders & Benefits In Immigration Bill w/ Bill O Reilly The so-called Gang of Eight was four Democrats and four Republicans, including Mr. Rubio, who drafted an immigration bill in 2013. It passed the Senate but was stymied by conservative opposition in the House.Details of the dinner, and a previous one in 2011, were provided to The New York Times by an attendee of one of the meetings and two people with knowledge of what was discussed at both get-togethers.None of the attendees agreed to be identified for this article because the conversations were supposed to be confidential.But on Monday, Mr. Limbaugh shed light on his interactions with the senators when he told a caller frustrated with his criticism of Mr. Rubio that the immigration position the senator had advocated  comes right out of the Gang of Eight bill. Mr. Limbaugh added,  I ve had it explained to me by no less than Senator Schumer. Mr. Schumer declined to comment for this article. But before Mr. Obama s re-election and soon afterward, he could hardly stop talking with conservative senators and media power brokers about the chance to pass comprehensive immigration legislation.As early as March 9, 2011, Mr. Schumer joined Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and another eventual member of the Gang of Eight, at the Palm restaurant in Manhattan, where they made their case to Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Ailes and Mr. Limbaugh in a private room. The senators argued how damaging the word  amnesty  was to their efforts, and walked Mr. Limbaugh through their vision for an immigration overhaul.",politics,"Feb 28, 2016",blockbuster discovery media level support amnesty gang bill football effort account media example media media reason term presidency news soul election article mind manipulation time media stunner senator marco push immigration overhaul executive room news corporation headquarters mission owner media empire roger chairman executive fox news division network air legislation chance advocate immigration reform lieutenant man television meeting breathing room media anger grass case king talk radio sway party base dinner news corporation headquarters outreach illustrate degree envoy media group legislation bill pathway citizenship expiration history rival nomination vow immigration centerpiece campaign era election president momentum nation immigration system tour editorial savior cover time magazine immigration contender trump leader fold legislation face grass backlash collapse media truce degree fox news dinner immigration bill bill gang immigration bill senate opposition house dinner york times people knowledge none article light caller criticism immigration position senator gang bill senator article election media power chance immigration legislation march senator republican member gang palm restaurant case room word amnesty vision immigration overhaul
1774, Conservatives ADMIT They Incited Violence At Berkeley; Here’s Proof (SCREENSHOTS),"Of course, when there s violence in protests, we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around. However, the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist, racist, white supremacist alt-right. Such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the Berkeley protests. The problem is, the alt-right was all over Twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa,  or anti-fascists, whom they ve branded as terrorists.Ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them, one particular person on Twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt-righters what to carry to Berkeley and how to set it up. They seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons.Check out what one of the  leaders,  named General Deplorable, posted to Twitter:General Deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal, so they can carry them into  battle,  as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle. Here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well:And this is General Deplorable s Twitter profile pic and info, which actually contradict each other:Here s the thing: This crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks.  This is what they really are:This is what #BasedStick means: a flagpole that doubles as an insurrectionist s weapon. #Berkeleyprotests https://t.co/ZD2tGdqjk0  Marie Walshe (@lacanlune) April 16, 2017The Berkeley Police Department sees these as weapons. In fact, any stick pole, post, or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool (along with anything else that can be used as a weapon) are prohibited. To listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams, though, it s the anti-Trump protesters who started everything, and Berkeley PD is horrifically biased. Yet, look at what they confiscated:Here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today. https://t.co/3qx3smYwgk pic.twitter.com/A70VCxFYEu  Berkeley Police (@berkeleypolice) April 15, 2017The American flags belonged to the alt-right, and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists. Lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence. They re who every  real American  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals,  but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support.It s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that, either.13 people were arrested and of course, General Deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and Berkeley PD for being biased towards the anti-Trump side, because of course.But they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally. All of this shows that they went there specifically for violence.Watch a short video of melee below:Demonstrators are punching each other and even using skateboards and helmets as weapons in #Berkeley. https://t.co/PAK3WUbllH pic.twitter.com/7G8hLtsA4I  NBC Bay Area (@nbcbayarea) April 15, 2017Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 15, 2017",course violence lot blame injustice injustice anybody racist alt right case today violence problem alt right violence moment fact terrorism person twitter alt sticks fact sticks battle battle violence twitter profile pic thing crowd flag sticks flagpole insurrectionist weapon police department fact pole post tool anything weapon media trump everything park today pic twitter police alt right bloc violence minority fringe group support people course trump side course rally violence watch video melee pic twitter area image capture video

2311, Internet Heroes Make Trump-Putin Facebook Friendship Anniversary Video; It’s BRILLIANT (VIDEO),"The internet is full of hidden gems, and this hostile political environment and corrupt Trump administration has given us some of the most hilarious, powerful memes and videos we ve seen in a while.

283," Trump Lashes Out At Puerto Ricans, Calls Them ‘Ingrates’ In Self-Congratulatory Tweets","Again, these are AMERICAN citizens he is talking about.If Donald Trump had treated Texas and Florida the way he is treating Puerto Rico right now, there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the White House.But apparently, people don t seem to understand that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that Texans and Floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states.Trump has not done that so far. Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates.

Furthermore, Trump insulted Puerto Ricans again. While Mayor Cruz is working to save lives, Trump is busy golfing and rage-tweeting. He is enraged because he thinks brown people should be grateful for what little help he has provided. That s a totally unacceptable way to treat American citizens.

23385,Utah Ranchers Vow to Stand Up to Government Abuse Despite Oregon Arrests,"Sam Levin The GuardianOn 23 January, a group of Utah ranchers gathered in Cedar City and made a pledge: they signed notices of  withdrawal of consent  to be governed   a statement rejecting the authority of the federal agencies that regulate grazing and charge fees to have livestock use public lands.The ranchers were following in the footsteps of Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who at the time was a leader of a land-use protest at an Oregon wildlife refuge and who had publicly refused to pay for grazing rights.Then on 26 January, state troopers in Oregon shot and killed Finicum during an attempted arrest, and two weeks after that, federal authorities detained and charged Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff at his property in 2014. Utah rancher Todd Macfarlane at public hearing in February (Image Source: Salt Lake City Tribune)The aggressive prosecution of the unofficial leaders of the land-use rights movement in the west appeared to be the government s way of sending a clear message that authorities would not tolerate these types of protests.But in remote desert ranges of Utah, ranchers say they remain committed to finding a way to stand up to what they see as federal overreach and mistreatment   even if the most vocal activists leading the charge are now dead or behind bars.There are a number of factors that make Utah a key battleground in the brewing fight, with some questioning whether tensions could boil over and erupt in the form of another high-profile standoff and national controversy.Some in rural parts of central and southern Utah tell stories of extreme overreach by the government, alleging that the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and environmental advocacy groups have used endangered species regulations and conservation initiatives to prevent families from sustaining ranches passed down through generations Continue this story at The GuardianREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Standoff Files",Middle-east,"April 5, 2016",sam group cedar city pledge withdrawal consent statement authority grazing charge rancher time leader land use protest wildlife refuge state shot arrest rancher standoff property rancher hearing image source city prosecution land use movement west government way message desert way overreach mistreatment charge number battleground brewing fight form profile standoff controversy tell overreach government bureau land management advocacy species conservation story standoff news century wire standoff
7489," Samantha Bee Invited Trump Fans To A Party, And All Hell Broke Loose (VIDEO)","Full Frontal host Samantha Bee braced herself and attempted a dialogue with Trump fans away from the mud-slinging happening across the internet. She gave Trump s followers a chance to show a better side of themselves and they blew it. Bee didn t cheat. She didn t walk into a roadside bar and grab a couple drunks with KKK t-shirts on. She invited a diverse array of Trump supporters: women, gay, black, Asian, college graduates, bi-partisan. All were represented. The common theme: none of them were able to put forward a single coherent response when asked the most simple questions about their candidate. And when pressed, all hit the hot button of anger.The host begins by showing footage of some of the racist violence spilling out at Trump rallies across the country. This includes the moment John Franklin McGraw of North Carolina sucker-punching a black protester and threatening to kill him (Trump later stated he would pay the attacker s legal bills, and those of anyone arrested for violence at his rallies).While Trump pinned the blame for violence on Bernie Sanders supporters, Bee showed footage of Trump fans telling bystanders to go to Auschwitz. Go to f**king Auschwitz.  Clearly, not a Sanders fan.But, Bee states, surely the millions of Trump supporters across the country can t be hysterical racists? There must be some sane, rational, people who are choosing to back Trump too. So she picked a sample and offered to put on a lavish party for them in exchange for an open conversation about their candidate and their views.It s actually more terrifying than the racist violence. What you see is smart, open-minded people  choking down their own souls to belong. Bee starts by asking the group how they feel about their candidates statements on banning muslims from the country. Temporarily!  they say, almost in unison.  For our national security. As if this somehow resolves the dilemma. They take no issue with lumping the world s 1.7 billion Muslims together as terrorists.However, when Bee asks them how they feel about white supremacists backing their candidate, they are up in arms at the lumping together of themselves with other Trump fans. One supporter doesn t even look remotely convinced of her own argument as she mumbles: We all love America, I guess. If there s something we can come together on, we want this country to be great, I think everyone can get behind that. Getting angry at the clear embarrassment this question has caused the group, one supporter strikes out with: It s clearly illogical to play the guilt-by-association game because we could do this all day long, To which Bee points out that they have no problem playing that game against Muslims.Silence.Bee moves on, asking the group how they feel about the racist violence breaking out at Trump rallies. They argue that the media is continuing to quote Trump out of context. So Bee plays the video of Trump inciting the crowd to attack a protester, stating that he would do it himself. She turns to the group and asks: Can you acknowledge that it is literally impossible, as a member of the media, to ignore a person when they say they would punch a protester in the face? One supporter dismisses the question out of hand, stating that if you get enough people in a space, somebody is always going to get punched in the face. Ok.Bee mingles around the the party, and chats to the woman who stated that Trump would bring America together. She tells Bee she really wants the wall, to keep out undesirables. When asked who will pay for it, the woman states with glee that Mexico will. Bee s fact checker points out that Mexico is on the record as stating they will not pay for the wall. To which the woman replies, wide-eyed: And you know what Trump said? The wall just got 10 feet taller! Her final chat at the party is with a man clearly on the verge of rage. Bee states that he is making her feel uncomfortable because although he is smiling, there is real anger in his eyes. With another burst of barely suppressed rage and pointing a finger in Bee s face, the man states: There s no anger, it s passion. Don t mistake that. Bee signs off with a resigned sigh that we have to withstand 8 months more of this  passion , while a rolling a montage of violence at Trump rallies.What is clear from the footage is that there s no way of holding a rational argument with a zealot. And what s clear from the Trump fan party is that he is encouraging zealotry, the unquestioning evangelism of Trump, in groups that might otherwise display all the signs of being critical thinkers and evidence-based voters. That is way if anything, this bizarre party is more terrifying than the hysterical scenes at the rallies   because these people know better, and they re choosing to be sucked into the dark world of Donald Trump anyway.

4648, ‘Christian’ Ex-Mayor Raped 4-Year-Old Girl For Three Years And Blames Her For It,"Another hypocritical  Christian  politician gets caught sexually abusing a child and has the gall to blame the victim instead of taking personal responsibility.Former Hubbard, Ohio mayor Richard Keenan faces a lengthy prison sentence after being indicted on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition last month.In 2010, Keenan bragged about his so-called  Christian  values upon becoming the new mayor.  I m a Christian,  Keenan told the Youngstown Vindicator at the time.  Dedicating my life to Jesus has changed my life. Don t preach it, but live it. Over the course of three years, Keenan repeatedly sexually abused a little girl from when she was 4-years-old until she turned 7.Keenan admitted to the crimes after the girl told his wife, who is a pastor, about the abuse.The 65-year-old Keenan also admitted to what he had done to other relatives in a group session at a hospital.He also told a social worker at a psychiatric facility about raping the girl, saying that the abuse began in 2013 but then blamed the little girl for his actions, calling her a  willing participant  who somehow consented to being raped by him.For some reason, Keenan was allowed to go free on $75,000 bond and won t stand trial until April of next year.If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.This is yet another example of a supposed  Christian  committing a heinous crime and being a complete hypocrite.At least in this case the pastor did the right thing by reporting her rapist husband to authorities instead of trying to cover it up like a church in Ohio did earlier this year when a youth pastor raped a teen girl repeatedly. Columbia Road Baptist Church could have prevented the sexual abuse had they fired and reported the pastor for obsessively sending text messages to the girl. But they basically looked the other way and gave the pastor the opening to take his obsession with the teen girl to a sick new level and then disgustingly blamed the victim and demanded that the girl apologize to the pastor s wife.And conservative  Christians  wonder why people are abandoning religion. THIS is why.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 13, 2016",child gall victim responsibility mayor prison sentence rape rape imposition month mayor vindicator time life life preach course girl girl wife pastor abuse year group session hospital worker facility girl abuse girl participant reason bond trial year life prison example crime hypocrite case pastor thing rapist husband church year youth pastor girl road church abuse pastor text girl way pastor opening obsession girl level victim girl apologize pastor wife people religion image

Without the division, the left has nothing Well, the The chairman of Democrats for Trump reacted to repeated calls for the president s impeachment and obstructionist behavior by members of his party. I think it s Trump derangement,  former New York City Council President Andrew Stein said on  Fox & Friends. Ed Henry played video of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) introducing articles of impeachment and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) telling a crowd that President Trump s motives and actions  are contemptible. Impeach 45 every day,  she later said.Stein said he doesn t know why his fellow Democrats think Trump is a  bad guy. Stein thinks President Trump should just continue to take his message to the people. We have to agree that the president needs to go around the lying media to deliver his message.The latest example of lying from the media is the poor treatment of First Lady Melania Trump. The media bombarded Melania with fake news about a tree that needed to be cut down. The press made it seem like  evil  Melania demanded that the tree be removed.

10020,President Trump’s Extreme Vetting Takes the Next Step…But Is It Enough?,"Will the new policy for face-to-face interviews with applicants for citizenship be enough to weed out terrorists who only plan on harming Americans?It s being reported that many seeking citizenship and asylum have converted to Christianity to better their chances of making it into their desired country:Breitbart News reported:Muslims migrating from Syria have admitted to converting to Christianity in a bid to boost their chances of being given asylum in the West, despite the risks associated with apostasy. Two Muslim Syrians living in Lebanon have told The Telegraph that they and their families have converted to Christianity because they believe it gives them a better chance of gaining asylum in the West, and because they can better access aid from Christian charities.Ibrahim Ali, who became homeless after moving to Beirut, told the paper:  A lot of people are doing it to get to Europe, the US and Canada. While I plan to stay in Lebanon, I know hundreds who been baptised just to help their applications. They would do anything to have security for their family. The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it will soon require more people to undergo in-person interviews before they can gain a firmer legal footing in the U.S., carrying out yet another part of President Trump s extreme vetting executive order.While the so-called travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries has garnered most of the attention, it was just a temporary measure designed to give the government the space to stiffen its regular checks so it could be more adept at denying potential terrorists entry.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced one of those new policies Monday, saying it wants more people to have to face in-person interviews before they re giving permanent status in the country.

7680, Bristol Palin’s Absurd Blog Post About Gun Safety Will Make You Weep For Her Children (VIDEO),"Bristol Palin has shown yet again not only how incredibly dense she is, but just how her children could suffer from her ineptitude as a parent and reasonable human being. Her latest Patheos blog post talks about just how lucky her son is to have grown up around guns because of an asinine gun control experiment out of Texas specifically aimed at gun sales to families. It s actually quite sickening.In the video, children are left into a room full of toys, among which is hidden an unloaded handgun. Within 15 seconds a child finds the gun and begins treating it like any of the other toys in the room. Parents stand horrified as their children, cast into an unsupervised play environment, take the gun and point it at each other. In the end, a police officer helping conduct this bogus  experiment  points out that the children playing with the gun come from a home with no guns, where the two children who wouldn t touch the gun come from homes where guns are available and talked about.That s what Bristol Palin decides to jump on. Finally, someone is calling her a good parent, which is, of course, ludicrous, but she seems to be comfortable with it. She wrote: Only the children whose homes had exposed them to guns knew not to touch the dangerous toy. As other children ran around pointing it at each other, two stood back because their parents understood the importance of teaching and appropriate exposure.Parents assume their child will automatically know what is and is not dangerous. The danger is not guns themselves, but a lack of education.So thankful Tripp is around guns and knows how to act around them. The danger is not the gun itself but a lack of education? What a crock of doody. This is America, Bristol. The bulk of guns owned by civilians are because of a lack of education. People believe guns make them safer, that they can thwart crimes and that they are somehow more patriotic for having one. The reality is far simpler: If there were fewer guns, fewer people would get shot.The entire scenario is designed to portray people who don t own guns as bad parents, because their children have no experience with guns. The two kinds of parents portrayed get the exact result you may expect, but Palin, as dense as she is, takes the lesson to the stupid place, arguing that only children who have been exposed to guns have a chance of growing up safe in America.The two types of parents not included that would round out this experiment would be the idiots who think kids don t need to learn about gun safety as long as you leave the safety on and parents who refuse to have guns in their home and add the benefit of educating their children why they are so dangerous. Those parents aren t needed to prove to someone as ill-prepared for parenthood as Bristol Palin that there may be more to this experiment. The notion that raising your children around guns makes them safer would be much more believable if we didn t have to read about yet another toddler killing his sister or a little guy pulling a gun from the glove compartment and shooting Grandpa. If there were no two-year-olds pulling pistols from their mothers  purse and shooting them in Walmart it may be easier to swallow.What may be a better gauge of how safe non-gun homes are as opposed to homes with guns would be to count the accidental firearm deaths from each. I can guarantee you that my children will never grab a loaded weapon from anywhere in my house and pull the trigger. I can also guarantee that they have seen and been taught exactly how dangerous guns are and wouldn t touch one for any reason in somebody else s home, either.It s all well and good to use these parents who probably haven t considered that their kids may run into guns at their friends  houses as bad examples, but in the end, they go home to a house with no guns; to playrooms where no guns will be hidden. Those  responsible  children? They may not have touched the gun but they are the only ones with true access. To think that is in any way good parenting is mind boggling.Here s the full seven-minute experiment:KWWL   Eastern Iowa Breaking News, Weather, ClosingsFeatured image from Gage Skidmore",News,"March 5, 2016",ineptitude parent post son gun control gun video room handgun child gun room play environment gun point end police officer conduct experiment gun home gun someone parent course toy importance teaching exposure child danger lack education danger gun lack education crock bulk lack education people reality people scenario people experience result dense lesson place chance experiment safety safety home benefit someone ill parenthood experiment notion toddler sister guy gun glove compartment grandpa year gauge non gun weapon house trigger touch reason somebody home end home house gun access way news weather image gage
201, WATCH: Reporters DRAG Sarah Huckabee Sanders In Brilliant Fact-Check (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle, not only because he continues to make it worse, but because America is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth.It was only yesterday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing Rep. Frederica Wilson for calling Trump out for disrespecting a Gold Star widow. Kelly also went after Wilson for an old speech in 2015, stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the FBI acknowledging two deceased agents. Little did Kelly know, this lie would ignite a sh*tstorm for the Trump administration.Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest Trump administration. Reporters blasted Sanders with questions in the press briefing, directly pointing out that Wilson s FBI speech completely contradicted Kelly s claims. When a reporter boldly pointed out that Wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech, Sanders stumbled through her response: Absolutely, General Kelly was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As he pointed out, if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes all about yourself, you re an empty barrel. Or as we say in the South, all hat, no cattle. This was hardly the end for Sanders. Because she d defended Kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims, reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech. Sanders claimed she had, and a reporter pointed out that she should know that Wilson actually praised the FBI agents and didn t talk about funding. Even as her spot was completely blown up, Sanders pathetically defended Kelly.The icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if Kelly would respond to more questions over the matter. When Sanders said he already had yesterday, the reporter pointed out: He was wrong yesterday! As usual, the Trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying. Sanders fired back: If you want to go after General Kelly, that s up to you. If you want to get into a debate with the four-star Marine general, I think that s something highly inappropriate.

850," ‘Lie After Lie After Lie’: Fox’s Shep Smith Breaks Ranks, Goes Nuclear On Team Trump (VIDEO)","As the Russia stories surrounding the criminal enterprise known as the Trump Administration continue to pile up, journalists all over network television are demanding answers. However, those journalists are usually not employees of Fox News. For many years, that particular network has generally been nothing more than a propaganda arm for the Christian Right and the most extreme elements of the Republican Party. However, there is one Fox journalist who has gone rogue: Shepard Smith.Now, Smith has been known to buck against the more ridiculous or downright lying elements of his network before. That has included being openly critical of the Trump Administration when most folks there are walking the party line. He s really taken things much further in that direction now, though, since the recent revelations regarding Trump s mini me s attempts to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians during the 2016 election season. Speaking with fellow more-reasonable-than-most Fox host Chris Wallace on Friday, Shep Smith went nuclear. Here is the transcript of that exchange from the Washington Post, which has called the diatribe Smith s  Cronkite moment : We re still not clean on this, Chris [Wallace]. If there s nothing there   and that s what they tell us, they tell us there s nothing to this and nothing came of it, there s a nothingburger, it wasn t even memorable, didn t write it down, didn t tell you about it, because it wasn t anything so I didn t even remember it   with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower? If all of that, why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know? My grandmother used to say when first we practice to   Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling. And there are still people who are out there who believe we re making it up. And one day they re gonna realize we re not and look around and go, Where are we, and why are we getting told all these lies? This is amazing, considering the culture over at Fox. Don t fall in lockstep? You re probably risking your job. Further, since Fox and their constant lies, spin, bigotry, misogyny, and all manner of distastefulness is so toxic to the other, more credible networks, a person might have a difficult time finding journalistic employment elsewhere. Given all of that, this was an amazingly courageous thing to do.Thank you for bringing real news to America s most deceitful network, Mr. Smith. Hats off to you, and keep it up. Perhaps CNN or   dare I say it   MSNBC will give you a shot should Fox heed the calls from deluded Trumpkins to fire you.

18024,LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD SUFFERS Worst Summer For Movies In 25 Years,"With the list of Hollywood actors and entertainers that Americans have decided to boycott over their sickening public hate for our President, is it really any wonder we re seeing the worst box office numbers in 25 years? Meryl Streep used her allotted time for accepting her lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to trash President Trump. At the start of her dramatic speech, Streep bemoaned to her fellow liberals that Hollywood  belong to one of the most vilified segments in America right now .  It appears that she hit may have actually the nail on the head. The problem with arrogant actresses like Meryl Streep who falsely believe that because they ve been gifted with exceptional acting abilities, that Americans should fall in line with their radical political beliefs or we are ignorant.""As my friend Princess Leia said to me once: take your broken heart, make it into art."" #MerylStreep pic.twitter.com/GzOHo7O729 #GoldenGlobes  Richard Hine (@richardhine) January 9, 2017And then there s Robert DiNero, who called candidate Trump  a punk,   a pig  and  an idiot.  Only days before the election, DiNero angrily admitted that he would like to assault our soon to be President, claiming,  I d like to punch him in the face .The list of Hollywood losers who have made vile, unfounded and even threatening remarks against a man who has put his very successful life on hold in an effort to save our nation is vast. The list of Hollywood losers who have said they would like to harm our President is also rather significant, starting with Madonna who got a visit from the secret service after she told a large, adoring group of women at the Women s March in DC, that she d like to blow up the White House.And then there s  comedian  Kathy Griffin, who saw her career literally blow up after making an ISIS style video holding up a decapitated and bloodied head of President Trump. Is Hollywood s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.The results have put the squeeze on the nation s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company s most recent quarter  simply a bust. Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day   a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales   down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began.  LA TimesBreitbart   Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is  6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.The summer box office is down a whopping  16% compared to 2016.Can a handful of titles   It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8   save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe.

1782, Trump Just Went Full Hypocrite On National Parks And He’s Getting TRASHED For It,"Donald Trump is a hypocrite and even conservative outdoor groups know it.America s greatest and most enduring treasure is its National Parks. Conservation of these lands started under Republican President Theodore Roosevelt and has continued to this day as every president has created new National Parks to preserve natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.But Donald Trump is on a mission to destroy everything that is good in this country and one of his targets are the very National Parks that millions of Americans visit every year.Trump s 2018 budget slashes funding for the Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service, by $2 billion and he has signed an executive order making it easier for mining and drilling to occur in and around the parks.In short, Trump doesn t want to give the National Park Service the money to protect the parks and he wants to let oil companies pollute them.Despite these facts, Trump had the gall to pretend that he loves our National Parks and that he wants to protect them.In a proclamation issued on Friday, Trump declared that protecting America s national parks is important to him and his administration. It is a priority of my Administration to protect these magnificent lands, and to ensure all Americans have access to our national parks, as well as to other National Park Service sites, throughout the next century It is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren. Again, Trump s budget would hurt our National Parks and mining and drilling would do lasting damage to lands that are supposed to remain pristine for future generations to come.In response to Trump s proclamation, conservation organizations trashed his hypocrisy. We re really surprised and disappointed to see the administration come after national parks this way,  senior manager for the National Park Conservation Association Nicholas Lund said.  With all that s going on in the world, drilling in our national parks should just not be a priority. Even the conservative-leaning Sierra Club had strong words for Trump. If he actually cared about protecting our parks, he would have never proposed a budget that slashes their funding to historically low levels at a time when investments are needed to maintain America s best idea,  executive director Michael Brune said.  Our parks and the people and economies they support need real commitments, not empty gestures. Indeed, our National Parks directly benefit the communities around them because of tourists, campers, hunters, photographers, and a multitude of people who desire to see America s natural wonders, the same natural wonders that their ancestors saw years earlier.That s what is at stake here. The National Parks belong to the people and they should be protected for all time, not exploited.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017",trump hypocrite outdoor treasure conservation president day president trump mission everything country millions year trump budget interior department park service executive order mining drilling trump park service money oil trump gall proclamation trump administration priority administration access park service century hope budget mining drilling response proclamation conservation hypocrisy administration way manager park conservation association world drilling priority leaning sierra club trump budget time idea executive director people multitude people stake people time image mark
8525, The End Of The Republican Party In One Simple Graph,"After getting crushed in the 2012 election, the Republican Party realized that they needed to appeal to more than just old angry white men. But they didn t do that. Instead, they doubled down on anti-Latino sentiment. Then they tripled down. Then they played their Trump card and that was the end of the GOP s Latino outreach. Now, Pew Research Center has released a study that confirms the Republican Party is doomed. Not only is the fastest growing group of voters Latino, Millennials (who already dislike the GOP intensely) make up the fastest growing segment within that already critical demographic.In other words, the people the least likely to vote for Republicans are going to be one of the most powerful voting blocks in just a few years. Just to make it a little more clear, here s what the growth of Latino voters looks like by the millions:And almost half of them are Millennials. If I were a Republican, this graph would make me wake up screaming every night. It s like the Grim Reaper showed up on my doorstep and said,  Hola, Gringo! I d feel bad for the GOP but they really did bring it on themselves. A few years ago, they MIGHT have been able to appeal to Latino voters. But the last two years have seen a repeat of the exact same short-sighted stupidity that drove the black community away from voting Republican for the last 50 years. Trump sped up the process considerably but it was already happening. You cannot tell an entire group of people that you hate their very existence and then be surprised when they vote against you.Republicans have painted themselves into a corner with no chance of escape. In order to rally their aging base, they demonized Latinos by pretending immigration was an existential threat of America. They were so successful in this that they cannot, in any way, appeal to Latinos without immediately alienating the old angry white people that keep them in office. But without the Latino vote, Republicans cannot possibly continue to compete at the national level for much longer.It s the most delicious Burrito of Electoral Doom imaginable and I can t wait to dig in!Feature image via Pew Research",News,"January 26, 2016",election party men sentiment card end outreach research center study party group segment demographic people voting growth millions half graph night reaper doorstep gringo feel repeat stupidity community trump process group people existence corner chance escape order base immigration threat way appeal people office vote level burrito doom wait image pew research

1746," Fox Host LOSES IT, Expertly Rips Trump’s ‘Buy American’ Policy APART (VIDEO)","While most of America can see right through to the flaws of Donald Trump s policies, it s always a special moment when someone from Fox News recognizes it.Earlier today, Fox host Shep Smith tore Trump s latest executive order apart, noting that it could actually ruin America s economy instead of help it. Smith, who has been a vocal critic on Trump before, expertly pointed out that Trump s announcement of a  Buy American and Hire American  order will actually cause the cost of goods in America to skyrocket.Trump s new plan will review the H-1B visa program for foreign workers; a program that many massive companies use. Pointing out that the program serves a purpose, Smith explained: Tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, and others all hire thousands and thousand of using it. Even automakers, including Ford and GM, use this program to find engineers. Executives for those companies argue they can t always find enough American workers with the skills needed for the specific jobs. They also claim the program encourages students to stay in the United States after school. Then, Smith went after Trump by pointing out that even the POTUS himself doesn t buy or hire American when it comes to his own businesses: But the White House says the companies take advantage of those visas, that they bring in large numbers of foreign workers pay them less, and drive down wages. President Trump himself has gone back and forth over this program. And as for the president s push to  buy American,  opponents point out the obvious, that some of the president s own products were made from workers from about a dozen other companies. And besides  the price of everything at your Walmart and your local store and everywhere else goes way up for you. Smith is exactly right and brilliant for exposing Trump s own hypocrisy, and for explaining to conservatives that the man they elected is not going to help America like they thought he would.You can watch Smith take down Trump below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017",trump moment someone news today host smith tore trump executive order economy help critic trump trump announcement order cost goods plan program program program purpose smith apple thousand ford use program specific program school trump buy hire house advantage wages president trump forth program president push president dozen price everything store way trump hypocrisy man image

9227,JUST IN: Pro-ISIS Terrorist Who Intended to Blow Up NYC Bus Terminal During Rush Hour Came To U.S. Through CHAIN MIGRATION Program Democrats Are Fighting For,"In September, President Donald Trump tweeted a new condition for a potential deal with Democrats on immigration. Trump warned that he would not budge on allowing the failed  chain migration  program to continue in the United States. CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  he wrote.CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 Business Insider attempted to paint a softer picture of the harsh realities (like terrorism) that chain migration brings with the unpopular program to the United States.Chain migration is a term almost exclusively used by immigration hardliners when referring to the family-reunification-based component of the US immigration system, through which US citizens or lawful permanent residents may sponsor close family members to join them in the US.Prominent anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA have frequently denounced chain migration, describing it as a process that admits  indefinite  numbers of unskilled immigrants based on family connections alone and that prompts foreigners to view US immigration as a  right or entitlement. Immigration proponents, however, describe family-based immigration as essential in helping new immigrants assimilate into US society. The American Immigration Council argues that newcomers who can bring family members with them when they immigrate to the US have stronger social and economic support that helps them  navigate the system. Trump s tweet about chain migration on Friday could signal a new bump in the road for any immigration deal with Democrats. The bipartisan Dream Act, recently reintroduced in Congress by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, includes a pathway to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, whose protections under the DACA program will be phased out over the next six months.FOX News reports  An attempted suicide bomber who set off a rush-hour explosion at the nation s busiest bus terminal is a Bangladeshi national living in Brooklyn who was inspired by ISIS, law enforcement officials said.The suspect in Monday morning s blast at Port Authority in midtown Manhattan was identified as Akayed Ullah, 27.

18015,BREAKING NEWS: DACA IS DONE! WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama’s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans,"President Trump keeps another promise. The winning streak for Americans continues The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives.

1413, GOP Senator Says Flynn Stonewalling Russia Investigation,"According to Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Michael Flynn is not willing to cooperate with the committee s investigation into Russian interference in American elections.In an interview with Capitol Hill press on Thursday, Burr told reporters that Flynn s attorneys  have not yet indicated their attentions  to comply with a subpoena, despite the fact that is only  a day or two left  before Flynn will be forced to produce documents and testimony or be held in contempt. Senator Burr was careful to couch his words to maintain an impartial stance, but reporters present said that the senator was clearly upset by Flynn s disregard for the investigation.Burr initially said that Flynn wasn t going to comply with the subpoena, but walked that statement back in order to make it clear that there was still time for his lawyers to reach out to the committee if they chose to do so.Do the MSM think I'm dumb enough 2 accpt their interview rqusts only 2 see my words twisted/spun 2 fit their #fakenews agenda? #WastingTime  I LOVE AMERICA?? (@mflynnJR) May 17, 2017Flynn himself has declined to comment on the investigation altogether, although his son, Michael Flynn Jr. has been talking on Twitter.Refusing to comply with this subpoena will all but disqualify Flynn from the immunity he sought last month, when his lawyer went on Twitter to beg multiple investigations to consider offering it to his client.Immunity from prosecution typically follows a clearly defined legal path, where the guilty party first meets with prosecutors and tells them everything he knows in a sealed session, which gives them time to consider making a deal. This is called a  proffer session  and Flynn has shown no willingness to do it.Instead, it appears as though Flynn and his attorneys expect the senate committee to blindly trust that Flynn has something meaningful to say in exchange for immunity.Judging by Burr s response, the senators aren t biting, and they re starting to lose their patience.

6053, Trump Angrily Goes After Hillary’s Competency With Misspelled Tweet,"On Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous Donald Trump would be not only to the nation, but to the world. She delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that Trump simply cannot be our next president.Not taking too kindly to the fact that Clinton was going after him, Trump quickly took to his medium of choice   Twitter.Trump wrote: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn t even look presidential! Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016If only he knew how to spell teleprompter.And does Trump consider name-calling, explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential? Apparently so.Oh, and yes, Trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well, and it was about as awkward as a 13-year-old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling.Truth be told, Trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a 13-year-old boy, probably more along the lines of a five- or six-year old. It s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people Hillary has cooties. Maybe he already has. Who s to know, really?Trump can go after Clinton all he wants on foreign policy, but the facts are the facts, and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience. For example, he has none, and she s a former Secretary of State who is more traveled than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic. She s brokered peace deals, for goodness sake.At the end of the day, it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done, and Trump most certainly is not that person.

6946, Boeing Cuts 10% Of Jobs After Receiving $8.7 Billion In Government Tax Breaks And Subsidies,"The Commercial Airplane Corporation, Boeing, announced job cuts for 2016 are likely to reduce the company s workforce by ten percent, roughly 8,000 jobs lost, according to Seattle Times. The company cited operating and labor costs as the reason for the job cuts, but that is inexcusable given the company received $8.7 billion in government subsidies and tax breaks in 2013 for building the 777x in the state of Washington. The company has already eliminated 9,000 jobs in the region since 2012.Boeing epitomizes how the economy is rigged to favor corporations and the wealthy. Boeing is assisted by the government to increase production and built new operations, and in return the government does not receive any share of the profits. In the company s efforts to increase profits, the workers and their families carry the burden. There is no accountability or terms of conditions for companies like Boeing who receive government handouts. This is corporate socialism.Robert Reich told Rolling Stone in an interview this past October about the building blocks of capitalism,  every one of these building blocks has been altered over the last 30 years by very powerful money interests who have succeeded in changing these building blocks so that they improve the finances and enhance the profits of big companies   Wall Street and the very wealthy   but make most other people worse off. He added in the interview a free market cannot exist without government setting the rules, but the government has been setting the rules to favor wealthy corporations who have been insulating themselves from the competitive market.What we have seen in the past few decades, and has worsened in the wake of the Citizens United SCOTUS ruling, is corporate and wealthy influences have pushed for government to set the rules in their favor so they can maximize their profits while the working and middle classes in this country. Politicians now have to worry more about who is going to fund them or their opponent in an election, leaving little to no time to focus on what is actually best for the public interest.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"April 12, 2016",airplane corporation job company percent times company operating labor reason job company government tax state company region economy government production return government share company burden accountability government socialism stone interview building capitalism building money building street people interview market cannot government government market wake ruling government favor working classes country opponent election time interest image
3810," Obama Takes Pity On Trump, Plans To Hold His Hand Because He Is Just So Damn Clueless","Donald Trump has no idea WTF he is doing. None. I know, shocking, right? Thankfully, President Obama has decided to take pity on him (or maybe he s really taking pity on us) and is planning to help Trump figure out just how this president gig actually works.After winning the election on Tuesday, Trump visited the White House to meet with Obama and formally begin the process of transition. Sources familiar with the meeting told the Wall Street Journal that it quickly became abundantly clear that Trump was completely clueless. Trump and his team didn t even know that they were responsible for staffing the West Wing. The president has concluded that, for the good of the entire country, he is going to have to help his successor try to learn a thing or two.The WSJ reports: During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance. He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. To say that Trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement. He and all the people that he has working for him, who are the best people if you remember, couldn t manage to google this shit? But President Obama, being the true leader that he is, has decided that he will take one for the team and spend his last days in office mentoring the buffoon who will take his place.

The protesters also lit tiki torches as it became dark. I m her to take part in this great celebration of our heritage and to say  no  to the city of Charlottesville. You re not going to tear down our statue and you re not going to replace us,  said Richard Spence, white nationalist leader.You ll remember Spence as the asshole who was punched in the face on inauguration day in D.C. Spence lead this protest which received a lot of community backlash   from the same people who are against taking down the statue. This event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK,  said Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, who opposed removing the statues.Listen, Singer, if you disagree with the actions of touch-wielding racists mob, why do you oppose removing the hate-fueling racist statue?

781, Trump’s America: White Supremacist Blogger Given Job As Federal Judge,"The most controversial judicial nominee on President Trump s list was just confirmed on Thursday in a U.S. Senate vote catastrophe.Meet John Bush, a lawyer from Kentucky and an outspoken political blogger who bashes on gay rights and who believes that the Roe v. Wade decision was equally as deplorable as the Supreme Court s 1857 pro-slavery decision.This right-wing nutjob is now the newest judge on the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.John Bush has published over 400 articles in his career as a right-wing blogger. Under a fake pen name, he regularly cites conspiracy theories and fake news stories from alt-right media reports   including the ridiculous story that President Obama was born outside the U.S.During his confirmation hearing, Bush attempted to downplay his destructive alt-right views as  political activity.  He openly made a pledge to separate his personal politics from his work as a judge on the courtroom bench.The confirmation hearing final vote came in with 51-47, without Republican John McCain.This is the fourth judicial nominee of Trump s to win confirmation, with twenty-two pending nominations. There are far more judicial vacancies on the federal bench than usual, and Trump is actively seeking to fill the slots. The president is looking for judges who are conservative but also young and able to serve for a long time in an effort to permanently shift the judiciary over to conservative activists. At this rate, Trump will quickly erase the judicial nomination gains made by the Obama administration over his entire two terms.Feature Image Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Image ",News,"July 23, 2017",nominee president trump list vote catastrophe meet lawyer gay roe decision court decision wing judge circuit court bush career wing pen name conspiracy news alt media story president confirmation hearing bush alt activity pledge politics work judge courtroom bench confirmation vote nominee trump confirmation bench trump president time effort judiciary rate trump nomination gains administration image photo mark image
7058, Daily Show Finds Disturbing Comment Donald Trump Made About His Daughter In 1994,"On Tuesday, April 5th, the Daily Show with Trevor Noah surfaced a 1994 video clip from the show,  Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.  The host of the show asked Donald Trump and his wife at the time, Marla Maples, about their hopes for their 1-year-old baby daughter. Donald Trump s response was totally creepy. Well, I think that she s got a lot of Marla, she s a really beautiful baby, and she s, uh, she s got Marla s legs. We don t know whether or not she s got this part yet,  Trump said regarding his wife s chest,  but time will tell. His wife at the time nervously laughed at Donald Trump s inappropriate comment.The Daily Show aired this clip in a line with several other overtly sexist comments Donald Trump has made about women. In addition to his abrasive relationship with Fox News Host Megyn Kelly, the current Republican front runner for the presidential nomination has criticized former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina for her looks, condescendingly belittled other reporters, made sexist remarks towards Hillary Clinton, Arianna Huffington Heidi Klum, his ex-wives, women on his TV show, Celebrity Apprentice, and countless others.In 2013, he tweeted that women should expect sexual assault in the military, and wrote in a book published in 2006 women are basically objects meant to look good. Beauty and elegance, whether in a woman, a building, or a work of art, is not just superficial or something pretty to see,  he wrote.Donald Trump s record of overt sexism is endless and spans his entire life in the public eye. He can t seem to get through an interview without making some sort of sexist remark or conclusion, and the scariest part is millions of his supporters agree and applaud every single word he says. The fight for gender equality still has many obstacles to overcome and the condoning of Donald Trump s behavior by his supporters and those in the media who don t bother to acknowledge and criticize it bring those obstacles out into the open for the public to see. As feminists, which every Democrat should consider themselves to be, we need to ensure sexism isn t dismissed or neglected as acceptable or commonplace, rather these sexists, especially ones with such a platform as Donald Trump, need to be engaged and held accountable for their remarks.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 6, 2016",show video clip show host show trump wife time year baby daughter trump response lot baby part wife chest time wife time trump comment show clip line trump addition relationship news host front runner nomination candidate show celebrity apprentice countless assault book beauty elegance woman building work art something trump record life eye interview sort remark conclusion part millions word fight gender equality trump behavior media public democrat commonplace platform need image courtesy
8867," This Pill Is 25,000% More Expensive In America Than In India – And You Can Blame The U.S. Government For It","In 2013, Gilead Sciences Inc. filed an application with the FDA for a new drug that they claimed could cure hepatitis C. The drug was nothing short of a miracle.The new wonder drug was named Sovaldi. Where previous hep C treatments had a minimal success  rate and involved 6-12 months of grueling treatment that involved a slew of harsh side effects, Sovaldi cured people at a 94%+ rate in one 12-week treatment. It was so good, that Gilead received the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is given to drugs that show a tremendous advance over existing options and treatments.After an astonishingly fast review process and approval by the FDA, Gilead filed a patent for Harvoni which is Sovaldi combined with an NS5A inhibitor. Demand for Harvoni skyrocketed globally because currently there are approximately 130 million to 150 million people living with hepatitis C around the world.To call this a medical advance of historic proportions would be putting it mildly. The unfortunate fact is that the very thing that makes Harvoni so wonderful is what makes it absolutely terrible  if you happen to live in America.In the U.S., a 12-week course of Harvoni costs $84,000   $94,000. It works out to approximately $1000 per pill. If you lived in India, the cost per pill is $4.I get it. The cost to develop a drug can be staggering. Research and development work, plus the employees who perform it, are not free. Then there are trials and further tests. It all gets expensive. But here is the problem; Gilead didn t do any of these steps. It turns out, Sovaldi was already invented by a group called Doctors of the World at Cardiff University in 2007.DotW is claiming that Gilead merely copied their publicly funded research, rushed it through FDA approval and patenting, and then immediately jacked the price to reap an absolutely insane profit. It worked. In 2014, Gilead had a total revenue of $24.9 billion compared to $11.2 billion in 2013.Comparing this to India, you start to see the disgusting truth of it all. The Indian government denied Gilead a patent in their country, on the grounds that they couldn t prove that the drug was more effective at treating hep C than what was invented at Cardiff University in 2007. This has forced Gilead to actually compete in a free market.Due to not having a government-sanctioned monopoly in India, Gilead was forced to sell their pill at $4. This results in a total cost to save your life of about $340.For the cost of the same treatment with the same pill in America, where we have  the most amazing healthcare system in the world,  you could literally move to India, live there for about 2 years, take the drug for a few weeks during that time, get cured, then move back and still come out saving money.How freaking ridiculously insane is this?!A lawsuit was filed by Doctors of the World against Gilead as well, on the basis that the drug molecule was not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Seeing as India s regulatory agencies and patent office has already concurred with the opinion in this lawsuit, things do not look to be going well for Gilead in the future. I personally wouldn t be buying their stock.This brings us to the heart of the problem. Gilead essentially ripped off publicly funded work, copied a drug, then  innovated  by mixing it with a secondary drug to call it unique. This justified the technicalities required for a patent, but it violated the spirit for which patents are intended. If the FDA and U.S. patent office did some due diligence and used India as a precedent, denying Gilead their vulture capitalism cash cow, this would not be an issue.The FDA has a problem with revolving door crony capitalism. One example is FDA member Milton Packer, who chairs the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. Packer reviews applications for drugs submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval. He is also financed by Novartis and has spoken on their behalf to the advisory board he himself chairs. He has also gone to bat in his own committee for GlaxoSmithKline in 2003, Spoke for Sanofi in 2009, and consulted for Pfizer in 2010.Packer s activities, while part of a government board meant to impartially regulate pharmaceuticals on behalf of the nation, scream conflict of interest. And he is only one person among many who participate in this sort of nonsense.Government involvement in a market, especially one like pharmaceuticals, is desperately needed. However, when that government involvement ends up being corrupted to where it serves the needs of corporations over people, it becomes a government-sanctioned monopoly that is enforcible by law.Real progressive regulatory and patent reform is so desperately needed in America, and any presidential candidate who is serious about helping the middle class should make it a primary focus of their campaign.Featured image via drugs.com",News,"January 9, 2016",application drug hepatitis drug nothing miracle drug hep success rate treatment slew side effects people rate week treatment breakthrough therapy designation advance review process approval patent inhibitor demand people hepatitis world advance fact thing week course pill cost pill cost drug research development work problem group world university research approval price profit revenue truth government patent country grounds prove drug hep university market government monopoly pill cost life cost treatment pill system world drug time money insane lawsuit world basis drug molecule patent patent office opinion lawsuit future stock heart problem work drug drug patent spirit patent office diligence precedent vulture capitalism cash cow issue problem door crony capitalism example member packer cardiovascular committee packer approval behalf board committee spoke packer part government board behalf nation scream conflict interest person sort government involvement market government involvement needs people government monopoly law reform candidate class focus campaign image
14389,THE “OBAMA PROJECT”…Does Barack Have Secret Plans To Punish White America After He Leaves Office?,"Is Barack Obama planning to use taxpayer money to travel around the world campaigning for UN Secretary General?The Jerusalem Post reported that Barack Obama has privately campaigned to succeed Ban Ki-moon as United Nations Secretary General at the end of 2016.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also reportedly working with moderate Arab States to prevent this transition.Netanyahu remembers well just how US President Barack Obama brushed aside Israeli objections and went ahead with the P5+1 nuclear agreement with Iran.Now, Netanyahu is reportedly planning some personal payback.The sources said that once Netanyahu got wind of Obama s plans, the prime minister began to make efforts to submarine what he has referred to as  the Obama project.  Via: Gateway PunditThis shocking report outlines how the United Nations believes Americans should be paying reparations to African American descendants of slavery. You don t need much of an imagination to picture Barack Obama moving seamlessly into the role Secretary General of this global sham of an organization. Is the UN simply laying the groundwork for a future Secretary General Barack Hussein Obama? The United States should consider reparations to African-American descendants of slavery, establish a national human rights commission and publicly acknowledge that the trans-Atlantic slave trade was a crime against humanity, a United Nations working group said Friday.The U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent released its preliminary recommendations after more than a week of meetings with black Americans and others from around the country, including Baltimore, Chicago, New York City, the District of Columbia and Jackson, Mississippi.After finishing their fact-finding mission, the working group was  extremely concerned about the human rights situation of African-Americans,  chair Mireille Fanon Mendes-France of France said in the report.  The colonial history, the legacy of enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the U.S. remains a serious challenge as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. For example, Mendes-France compared the recent deaths of unarmed black men like Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police to the lynchings of black men in the South from the post-Civil War days through the Civil Rights era. Those deaths, and others, have inspired protests around the country under the Black Lives Matter moniker. Contemporary police killings and the trauma it creates are reminiscent of the racial terror lynchings in the past,  she told reporters.  Impunity for state violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Some of the working group s members, none of whom are from the United States, said they were shocked by some of the things they found and were told.For example,  it s very easy in the United States for African-Americans to be imprisoned, and that was very concerning,  said Sabelo Gumedze of South Africa.Federal officials say 37 percent of the state and federal prison populations were black males in 2014. The working group suggests the U.S. implement several reforms, including reducing the use of mandatory minimum laws, ending racial profiling, ending excessive bail and banning solitary confinement.

14696,"[VIDEO] GERMAN MAYOR Blames Victims Of Mass Rape, Sexual Assault By Muslim Migrants For Not Defending Themselves","Because blaming the Muslim migrants who raped and sexually assaulted an untold number of women on New Years Eve would be politically incorrect and certainly not very hospitable A political scandal is developing in Germany as ordinary citizens wake up to the scale of the migrant crime cover-up, and the callous reaction of the mayor of Cologne to mass-sex crime on new year s eve.The Mayor of Cologne has spoken out about the attacks, but her carefully chosen words are unlikely to delight many. Rather than addressing the root causes of the violence   unlimited mass migration and a totally failed system of integration   the newly elected pro-migrant mayor instead blamed the victims of the sexual abuse for having failed to defend themselves against the immigrant attackers.Here is a video of the shocking chaos that took place on New Years Eve:Speaking on live television this afternoon mayor Henriette Reker, who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to October elections by an anti mass migration campaigner, said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants.She remarked:  The women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don t happen again. This means, they should go out and have fun, but they need to be better prepared, especially with the Cologne carnival coming up. For this, we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves .What form this guidance will take is presently unclear, the mayor could take inspiration from young victim whose modest clothes protected them from the worst consequences of walking at night in areas controlled by migrant men. The woman said:  Fortunately I wore a jacket and trousers. a skirt would probably have been torn away from me .Despite her words of warning towards women in the city they could prepare for more violence against them, she refuted the suggestion there was any link between the attacks and migrants, contradicting her own chief of police.An opposition council member has today sounded the alarm bell on the deteriorating state of control the local government has over the city of Cologne, and in an official letter from the council group has warned those planning to come to the famous Cologne council next month  the city and the police  are unable to guarantee the safety of locals and tourists .Council group leader and lawyer Judith Wolter said in her letter to the people of Cologne today:  I want as a member of the Cologne City Council  to submit a travel warning for the carnival time in Cologne city centre. Especially the area in and around the central station, the cathedral and the adjoining area towards the banks of the Rhine for tourists (and locals) is no longer considered even in normal times as safe. For months, there is in these areas numerous thefts, open drug dealing, robberies and harassment of all kinds  Dozens of women were sexually harassed in public and there was at least one rape. Neither the city nor the police are able to guarantee in the territory described the safety of tourists and locals. Especially for women it must be assumed that a high security risk is here in the evening and night hours. At New Year s Eve there was a legal vacuum and a no-go area for women. With the climax of the Carnival season it is unfortunately expected to be a similar situation .German police have admitted to losing several urban areas to migrant gangs as so-called no-go zones, but this is possibly the first time a public square in the centre of a European city has been acknowledged by officials as having been lost to criminality, and out of the control of police at night.News of the attacks was suppressed for days, with just short reports of isolated incidents in Cologne city centre making it to local outlets on New Year s Day.The Kolnifsche Rundschau described the scene at the railways station as  largely peaceful  and made no effort to describe those who attacked the young women, one of which told press she had  fingers on every orifice  after she was stripped near naked.Only after nearly 100 victims of assault and abuse came forwards to police, and stories of attacks started circulating on social media did the truth of the situation start to slowly emerge, forcing local police to hold a press conference on Monday afternoon.Despite the chief of police admitting the enormous scale of sexual assault and confirming the attackers were of  North African and Arab  origin, much of the mainstream media is still in damage control mode, either trying to shift the focus from migrants, or avoiding the events completely.

7834, Big Corp. Is So Afraid Of A Liberal SCOTUS They Just Settled A MASSIVE Lawsuit,"It looks like Justice Antonin Scalia s untimely death is not just causes Republicans to lose their minds in fear, a giant corporation embroiled in a class action lawsuit is just as scared. In fact, they are so afraid of the possibility of a split or liberal Supreme Court that they have settled their lawsuit for almost a billion dollars.Dow Chemical was set to go in front of the SCOTUS after a 2013 ruling by a Kansas court upheld a massive $1.06 billion judgement against the company for price-fixing. The company sued and found liable after being accused of colluding with four other chemical companies (Bayer AG, BASF SE, Huntsman International LLC and Lyondell Chemical Co.) to fix the prices of polyether polyol products   which are used to make urethane foam   in order to overcharge customers in the  90s and early 2000s.The company was counting on Scalia to rule in their favor and overturn the huge judgement, but then he died. His death meant that one of two things would happen 1.) they d go in front of 8 justices and get a split decision which would uphold the $1.06 billion ruling, or 2.) they would face a liberal court if Obama gets someone on the court and the judgement would also be upheld. When they realized that they were screwed they issued a statement announcing they d settled and blamed it on Scalia s death:The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) has entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the In re Urethanes Class Action litigation. In this settlement agreement, Dow has agreed to pay the plaintiff class $835 million Growing political uncertainties due to recent events within the Supreme Court and increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits have changed Dow s risk assessment of the situation. Dow believes this settlement is the right decision for the company and our shareholders.Translation: Scalia died and f*cked us over, so now we are being forced to pay $835 million to all of the people we hurt.Scalia s death didn t just hurt Dow though, there are a number of other huge corporations set to go in front of the court, including Microsoft and Tyson Foods.What s actually really infuriating about this is that Dow was so sure that they were going to win this case until Scalia croaked. This guy was such a corporate shill (as are the rest of the conservative members) that big companies who had judgements levied against them were happy to go in front of the court because they knew they d win.So, while this sudden settlement may be hilarious, it is also pretty damning. It really highlights how much the conservative Supreme Court has hurt average Americans in order to help big business.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"February 26, 2016",justice death fear corporation class action lawsuit fact possibility split court lawsuit chemical front ruling court company price company chemical se foam order overcharge company favor death meant front split decision ruling court someone court statement death dow chemical company dow settlement agreement class action litigation settlement agreement dow plaintiff class court likelihood business class action dow risk assessment situation dow settlement decision company translation people death number front court dow case guy shill rest front court win settlement supreme court order business image

There s no denying that the Fairey poster raised Obama s cool factor a few notches with the artsy LA crowd and the urban hipsters. We guess you can say that this artist is a little responsible for the  HOPELESS  8 YEAR TERM OF OBAMA SABO CRASHES OBAMA ARTIST S NEW EXHIBITION:Well, he was debuting his new exhibition,  Damaged,  Saturday night in L.A. According to HuffPost, the show is his largest to date and features printmaking, sculpture, painting, mixed media, collage, and more.For a guy who preaches against capitalism, this Obama artist sure is making lots of dough Sabo even called him out on it in a series of tweets below. Fairey is milking his Obama-fame for every last drop he can get from the liberal elitists in Hollywood.Fairey reportedly created his  We the People  series specifically to protest President Trump: The state of our society is damaged,  Fairey stated at a press preview of the exhibition on Friday.  I know it sounds pretty dire, but acknowledging that we need to do better is the first step. Sabo, for one, believes Fairey needs to do better . MINE WAS THE ONLY REAL PUNK ART THERE,  the street artist proclaimed on Twitter Sunday. He added that his MAGA flag was taken down after about 30 minutes.  SABO SAD,  he said.

4908, Chicago Police Dept. Points Out TWO Huge Flaws In Trump’s Chicago Violence Lies,"Trump s wild lies continue unabated as he continues to say that he s met with people that have never once spoken to him. This time, he s claiming he talked to the Chicago Police Department about the city s violence, and a  top officer  told him that he could solve the problem in just a week. The problem, according to Trump, is that they don t have the authority to do so.Trump appeared on Bill O Reilly s show, where he was asked about how to solve Chicago s violent crime problem. Trump spun a whopper of a lie answering that: How? By being very much tougher than they are right now. They re right now not tough. I could tell you this very long and quite boring story. But when I was in Chicago, I got to meet a couple of very top police. I said,  How do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge   to a specific person   do you think you could stop it?  He said,  Mr. Trump, I d be able to stop it in one week.  And I believed him 100 percent. Har de har har   Trump will say anything to convince people that he knows what he s talking about. There is no way to solve any city s violence problems in a single week. Of course, to avoid looking like the fool he is, he said that he didn t ask for this mysterious officer s strategy when O Reilly asked for it.That vagueness is one of the ways that Trump maintains credibility despite all his lies.CPD refuted his claim that he s spoken to them, and one of their spokespeople said: We ve discredited this claim months ago. No one in the senior command at CPD has ever met with Donald Trump or a member of his campaign  Beyond that, the best way to address crime is through a commitment to community policing and a commitment to stronger laws to keep illegal guns and repeat violent offenders off the street. Once all of this became common knowledge, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, tried to turn it around on the media by saying that Trump had never said he met with top brass. She claims that s what the media said, which is in keeping with the campaign s assertions that the media intentionally twists his words.CPD has disputed claims from Trump before. Back in March, when he canceled a rally due to violence and said that CPD told him to do so, they said that nobody had ever met with him, let alone told him to cancel his rally for safety reasons.Trump doesn t even know when he s lying because he does it so much. This is another example of that.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",trump people time police department city violence officer problem week problem trump authority bill show violent crime problem trump whopper lie story couple police charge person trump week percent trump anything people way city violence week course fool ask officer strategy vagueness ways credibility claim claim one command trump member campaign way crime commitment community commitment repeat street knowledge trump campaign spokeswoman media trump brass media campaign media trump back march rally violence nobody rally safety example image spencer
3992, Democrats In Four States Are Now SUING Trump For Voter Intimidation,"Democratic party leaders from four states have officially filed federal lawsuits against Donald Trump and his advisor Roger Stone, as well as the state Republican parties for conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, were spearheaded by Marc Elias, who is the general counsel for Hillary Clinton s campaign. The suits request a federal judge to step in and prevent the defendants from activities such as monitoring polls and verbally harassing voters.The suit against Trump, Stone, and the Nevada Republican Party, which was filed by the Nevada Democratic Party, quotes an unnamed Trump official who said, [w]e have three major voter suppression operations under way.  This, says the suit, is proof of their intentions.The complaint also says: Trump s supporters have responded with pledges to descend upon polling places in  certain areas  where many minority voters live in order to interfere with their efforts to exercise the franchise Immediate relief is necessary. There are only 8 days left until Election Day, and early in-person voting in Nevada is well underway. Trump s calls for unlawful intimidation have grown louder and louder, and the conspiracy to harass and threaten voters on Election Day has already resulted in numerous acts that threaten to interfere with the voting rights of registered Nevada voters. Stop the Steal, a super PAC formed by Stone, is also named in the suit. According to the lawsuits, Stone has a history of engaging in voter intimidation, racist and misogynist hate speech, and incitement to violence. The complaint further states that Trump has repeatedly spread  misinformation  about voter fraud by claiming that the election is rigged against him. An example of this is October 20 when Trump told a crowd gathered at a rally in Delaware, Ohio that Clinton is  truly capable of anything, including voter fraud. The lawsuit also states that Trump, Stone, and the local Republican parties have blatantly violated both the Voting Rights Act and the Klu Klux Klan Act.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 31, 2016",party trump advisor roger stone state intimidate minority election marc counsel campaign judge suit trump stone republican party party trump official voter suppression way suit complaint trump minority order franchise relief days election day person voting trump intimidation conspiracy election day steal pac stone suit stone history voter intimidation racist misogynist hate speech incitement complaint trump misinformation voter fraud election example trump crowd rally anything voter fraud lawsuit trump stone voting act act image chip
3680, Hateful Letter To Food Bank PROVES We Need Food Stamps (IMAGE),"A few days before Thanksgiving, a food bank in Central Texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a Trump supporter.Dear Foodbank:I don t understand who these poor folks are that need food. I assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to Texas for  free stuff.  And of course, our unemployed Africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.I expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost the election. Too bad; How sad.I also wonder if your organization is not one of those Phoney-Baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.In sort, no way.Signed,Citizen RobespierreNaturally, the food bank was mortified. The lack of empathy was disturbing,  says Paul Gaither, marketing and communications director for the Food Bank.  Most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. It s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  Gaither said.  Most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. Source: GivingCityAustinBefore I tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. First off, food should never be treated as a luxury. You can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. Of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.As for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. They are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. Collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. We should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.It s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. Texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi have lower wages. In other words, in states like Texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.Now, back to the food stamps argument. One Republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. While that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. People s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. We tried that in the past. It didn t work.Instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. If you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? No. That s where government comes in. Making sure Americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. Relying on bigots like Citizen Robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.As for the Central Texas Food Bank, well, they are a damn good charity. They score 100 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. The vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.Featured image via State Farm/Flickr.",News,"November 25, 2016",days food bank letter trump supporter understand food stuff course trouble equivalent year welfare lazy course drug food congenital liar rodham election organization baloney living sort way citizen food bank lack empathy marketing director food bank anything list people people times meet anyone source food letter food luxury life time people people year food border food border part year country nothing return people food people wage wages wages laziness nothing ability food table food argument government safety slack idea sort people ability people economy charity market work time history writer letter example charity charity minority government food citizen question matter food bank damn charity charity navigator majority people image state farm
4454," President Obama Rips Sexist, Fat Shaming Trump A New One (AUDIO)","Monday night s presidential debate showed a stark contrast between two personalities. One was calm and cool, even under stress and the other was a bloviating braggart who couldn t maintain his temper.On top of those  qualities,  Donald Trump is sexist and he proved it Monday night when Hillary Clinton brought up Trump s record of fat shaming a former Miss Universe. President Obama, as the father of two girls and the husband of a strong woman, was having none of that. One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest   he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them   and he called this woman  Miss Piggy,  then he called her  Miss Housekeeping  because she was Latina,  Clinton said Monday toward the end of the debate, as she ran through a list of things Trump has said about women.  Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November. Trump didn t really have an answer for Clinton, but the next day, he took to the talk show circuit and he doubled down on the fat shaming. On Fox & Friends, the morning after the debate, Trump said about Machado: She was the worst we ever had. The worst,  Trump said.  The absolute worst. She was impossible,  he continued.  She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight. And it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that her attitude. We had a real problem with her so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl; this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it was not quite that way, but that s OK. Hillary has got to do what she has got to do. Source: AZ CentralPresident Obama had enough! He, like every American should be, was deeply offended at Trump s fat shaming. In a telephone interview with Steve Harvey on Wednesday, Obama said there s no way he wants that in the Oval Office: You had somebody who basically insulted women and then doubled down I think this morning in terms of how he talks about them and talks about their weight and talks about, you know, how they look instead of the content of their character and their capabilities,  Obama said,  which is not somebody that I want in the Oval Office.

4740, Trump Threw Mar-A-Lago Fundraiser For Woman At The Center Of Bribery Scandal,"Just a few days after she made the decision to let an investigation of Donald Trump s Trump University slide, the former reality TV star held a fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi at his palatial Mar-A-Lago compound.News of the cash-fueled party comes as Trump faces renewed criticism after being fined by the IRS after it came to light that the Trump Foundation illegally funneled money into Bondi s re-election campaign.In March 2014, Donald Trump opened his 126-room Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 7, 2016",days decision investigation trump trump university reality star attorney pam mar compound news cash party trump criticism light trump foundation money election campaign march trump room palm beach resort person pam attorney general election campaign trump university trump check attorney general night fall foundation pac mar star power trump campaign boost post trump event mansion party trump windfall flow campaign money news relationship trump campaign media trump involvement corruption foundation optics charity place trump behavior attorney general trump university donation image

A Ballwin Police officer was in critical condition after he was shot in the neck during a traffic stop late Friday morning, police said.The male officer had stopped the car for speeding on northbound New Ballwin Road about 11 a.m., police said. As the officer went back to his car, the driver got out,  advanced quickly  and fired three shots at the officer, police said.Said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar:  Make no mistake, we believe that Ballwin officer was ambushed. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch agreed. It was clearly an ambush, an attack,  he said.  There was no confrontation, no argument, no nothing. He also said it appeared that one of the shots might have been fired after the officer fell.The gunman fled north on New Ballwin Road and was captured in Manchester several miles northeast of the shooting scene, after jumping out of the car and running, police said.A semiautomatic handgun was recovered, according to St. Louis County Police, who are taking over the investigation.The suspect, identified as Antonio Taylor, 31, of the 1200 block of Tower Grove Avenue, was charged with first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, armed criminal action and unlawful possession of a weapon. Bail was set at $500,000.Belmar, the St. Louis County chief, said his department has gone to 12-hour days throughout the weekend as result of heightened sense of alert after all that has happened nationally and now locally. We need somebody out there to meet us halfway, because it is very difficult for police officers to do their jobs now,  Belmar said.  At some point we need to tone down the rhetoric. The officer had radioed in that he was stopping a car about 11 a.m., police said. Then 911 dispatchers began getting reports of an officer shot.A woman living in the 300 block of New Ballwin Road near the scene of the shooting said she heard two gunshots and ran out her front door to see what happened. After seeing the wounded officer, she grabbed a towel to put on his neck to try to stop the bleeding. I tried to help the officer,  the witness said.  I just hope he s OK. The woman who helped the officer said she isn t trained as a nurse or first responder.  I m just a mom,  she said.She said her friend called 911 while a nurse performed CPR.Other residents living near the scene of the shooting said they heard gunshots but didn t know what they were at first. I thought it was kids or firecrackers or something,  said a resident on the street.  I m looking outside at many, many police officers. They all need our prayers. A camera in the police car caught the shooting on video, Scott said. He urged anyone else with any video of the incident to call police.Criminal historyIn 2006, Taylor was charged and convicted in Beck County, Okla., on charges of second-degree robbery and unauthorized use of a vehicle, online records from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections say. He was sentenced to five years in prison and was released in 2009.That same year, St. Louis prosecutors charged Taylor with unlawful possession of a firearm for a July 7, 2009 incident.He pleaded guilty, but his prison sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Mullen, online court records show. Mullen also ordered him to have mental health and substance abuse evaluations.Taylor then faced federal and state charges after being caught with a gun on June 14, 2010.Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Mehan, who prosecuted the case, said that on June 14, 2010, Taylor was caught with a gun in car that had been carjacked the day before.When he pleaded guilty to the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, Taylor admitted running when stopped by police and discarding a handgun.U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton sentenced him on Jan. 14, 2011, to 30 months in prison.He received a two-year sentence in St. Louis Circuit Court for a gun charge and resisting arrest, to run concurrent with the federal sentence.In June of 2013, Taylor wrote a letter to U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton asking to be released from supervised release early. Taylor wrote that he wanted to pursue an acting career. He said he had been working, had been free of violations and had not failed any drug tests.But later that month, his probation officer said that Taylor had repeatedly failed to show up for those drug tests, failed to report to the probation office, left eastern Missouri without permission and had been accused of assaulting his girlfriend when she refused sex.She also said that Taylor had contact with the police in Los Angeles on June 20, 2013.In that incident, Mehan said that Taylor was the passenger in a car that was stopped for not having license plates. Taylor was the passenger, and became extremely agitated after the stop, screaming and waving his hands around. After he was arrested, police found a loaded 9 mm pistol, Mehan said.In April of 2014, Taylor admitted violating his supervised release and Hamilton sentenced him to 15 more months in prison.He was released in March of 2015.McCulloch said police work is 99 percent routine and  there s no way to predict that something like this is going to happen.

1921, WATCH: Chuck Todd Puts The Screws To Mitch McConnell For Not Giving Merrick Garland A Chance,"Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017",court garland body replacement president president centrist judge garland supreme court justice job constitution behavior thing nominee confirmation hearing furthermore court nominee senate election year claim chuck response insistence court nominee tradition middle election year time everyone president house counsel shoe foot president vacancy middle election confirmation hearing court nominee history election year court fact senate justice year office senate election year election year franklin murphy court senate plenty precedent history proving senate tradition court election year confirmation hearing garland vote senator rationale confirmation garland floor rationale election look year people trump nomination people vote reason confirmation hearing precedent record trump reason senate response garland way garland senate conduct precedent kind resolution court election year president senate court nomination end video excuse curt justice fact control senate court seat garland confirmation hearing someone court way garland image
21716,WHY IS OBAMA DISARMING COPS IN AMERICA At Same Time Terror Threat Is Being Raised?,"In the face of mounting threats of terrorism and civil unrest in U.S. cities, President Barack Obama is arbitrarily prohibiting local police and sheriff departments from obtaining military surplus equipment from the Defense Department as part of what many law enforcement officers are calling his war on police.Beginning on Monday, Obama visited a number of high-crime areas   especially those with large black populations   to explain the need for his unilateral action, according to news sources on Monday.President Obama s spokespeople said Monday that the administration will no longer give local cops some types of protective gear and vehicles while putting stricter controls on other weapons and equipment distributed to law enforcement. The details were released prior to Obama s visit to Camden, News Jersey, Monday afternoon to give a speech on how he will address police officers allegedly using racist tactics based on racist departmental policies.Obama and his supporters view police wearing protective riot gear and using armored vehicles as being overly-aggressive in neighborhoods that are predominately black and Hispanic. The President even accused some departments of issuing bayonets, which is demonstrably untrue, according to one police officer who claims she voted for Obama in 2008.  This President actually shows his dislike for local cops. I believe he wants to federalize policing and do away with local and state law enforcement. While the constitution prohibits that, when was the last time Obama cared about what the constitution says,  said Iris Aquino, a former police detective.During Obama s speech in Camden, New Jersey, a city reputed to have the highest violent crime rate in the United States, not once did he mention the police officers who were gunned down by blacks or whites within the last few months, noted a New York City police official who has been active fighting against the anti-cop Mayor Bill de Blasio.  That s because Obama like many liberal-left ideologues believe that police officers are the primary oppressors of minorities. The fact that Obama and the  racial-division industry    which includes the likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson   keep blacks in a state of poverty in order to use their anger and resentment for their own political interests appears to escape the notice of the news media, another group that doesn t care about dead cops,  he said.Originally police officers were led to believe that Obama would continue the Pentagon s military surplus program, however a panel of his sycophants warned that there is a propensity for misuse of equipment such as armored vehicles, high-powered firearms and camouflage. But not one example of police misusing an armored vehicle has been reported.  I have not heard of one incident in which police misused an armored vehicle. These are defensive vehicles used by cops to protect themselves from gunfire, Molotov cocktails, explosives and weapons of mass destruction,  said former law enforcement commander Jack McGowan.  High-powered firearms? The police use nothing that even resembles a  powerful  firearm. And camo clothing is clothing. No one gets hurt from a shirt s design pattern,  McGowan said.Besides cutting off the flow of equipment that would have gone to local law enforcement, the Obama government considering a recall of certain equipment that was already give to local police and sheriffs departments.  I ll highlight steps all cities can take to maintain trust between the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line, and the communities they re sworn to serve and protect,  Obama said in his weekly address out Saturday.Obama believes law enforcement is a necessary evil, claim his opponents.  He s never showed local cops any respect. He also doesn t trust any agency he doesn t directly control. This is an American leader who wants to federalize the law enforcement function and he has a lot supporters who trust big government over states rights,  political strategist Michael Baker.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani s Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he believes a  war on police,  exists in America, the anti-cop attitudes are being stoked up by Obama and his minions.  After 20 years of incredible crime reduction accomplished by thousands of dedicated police officers, the public has become complacent now that they are safer,  said Safir.  They have let the anti-police pundits and talking heads convince everyone from the president to the attorney general that police are racist and brutal.

She spoke to Inside Edition this week as Weiner awaits sentencing for transferring obscene material to a minor.The girl is not being named because she is still a minor but her father gave permission for her face to be shown. She was 15 when she struck up an online and text relationship with Weiner in January 2016.It sparked a months-long exchange between them which included graphic messages and topless photographs of the 53-year-old former New York congressman.In her interview this week, the teenager said she was  disgusted  by the messages she received from Weiner who, at the time, was still living with wife Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton s closest aides.The teenage girl first made contact with him through a private Twitter message where she told him she was a fan in January 2016. She was aware the previous sexting relationships which torpedoed his political career and but said she wanted to see if he would take the bait given Clinton s presidential bid.  I knew that Hillary Clinton would be running for president in the year 2016 and I wanted to see if Anthony was still up to the same antics,  she said.After speaking briefly on Twitter, she and Weiner soon began exchanging text messages and his input quickly turned sexual.  I knew it was going downhill and really fast,  she said.For months afterwards, they exchanged sexually graphic text messages and he sent her photographs of himself in various states of undress, sometimes posing with his son.

8934, Bernie Sanders Roasts Donald Trump: ‘I Don’t Have To Spend Money’ To Make Him ‘Look Dumb’ (VIDEO),"On Tuesday s edition of  The Nightly Show, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders promised to steal the White House from Republican front runner Donald Trump if the two should ever face off in the presidential election.On the show, host Larry Wilmore asked Sanders what he thought about Trump s much-reported use of the word  schlong  to insult Hillary Clinton. Sanders, making a joke out of Trump s numerous nonsensical remarks, said: I don t know the answer to that. I have yet to recover from Trump s shock that women go to the bathroom. I m still recovering from that, so  schlonged,  I haven t figured out yet. Wilmore pressed on, asking Sanders if he would  schlong  The Donald if they went head to head for the presidency. Sanders replied,  Let me say, we will beat him badly. How s that? Wilmore also brought up the fact that someone had been writing anti-Trump messages in the sky last weekend, right above the Rose Bowl Parade. Wilmore asked Sanders if he d had anything to do with it, since there had coincidentally been a rally for Sanders at the same time. Sander responded with something we all know to be true: I don t have to spend money to make Donald Trump look dumb   he does it all by himself. You can watch Sanders roast The Donald below: The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveIn later parts of the interview, Sanders took the opportunity to express his support for President Barack Obama s executive action on guns, blasting Republicans for trying to hold back an initiative that was so badly needed in America. We re not getting any cooperation from the Republicans, no matter how many horrific mass shootings we see. I think the most important thing we have to do now is to expand and improve the instant background check. What the president is trying to do now is deal with the so-called gun show loophole. Many of Sanders  constituents in Vermont are responsible gun owners, but Sanders said they accept the dangers that can come with firearms and don t argue that policies must be in place to avoid their misuse. People hunt and they do outdoor things   that s what we do. But the vast majority of the people understand, in my state, and I think around the country, that it s imperative that we do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Criminals (and) people who are mentally unstable should not own a gun. That s my view, and there is a broad consensus around that. Also touching on the Black Lives Matter movement, Sanders and Wilmore agreed that the media has blown controversial issues out of proportion. Sanders said, I think white people are as appalled as African-Americans and Latinos in seeing what we re seeing on television, and that is unarmed people being killed while they re in police custody. The Vermont senator, who has made criminal justice reform a crucial part of his campaign, also stressed that reducing police brutality would be one of his priorities as president: The first, and maybe most, important is to make sure that if a police officer breaks the law, that officer   like any other public official   must be held accountable. Other things that we have to do is demilitarize many of our local police departments. We have to make police departments look like the communities they serve, in terms of diversity. What appalls me is that we have more people in jail today than any other country on Earth   more than China, 2.2 million people   and that s why we need real criminal justice reform. We ve got to make sure that kids have jobs and education, rather than hanging out on street corners unemployed.

8579, White High-Schoolers Break The Internet With This Truly Racist Yearbook Photo (IMAGES),"A group of seniors from Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona posed for their yearbook photo this week. But instead of high fiving, or the lens snapping them mid-leap   they opted to spell out a racial slur with their t-shirts. The image has since gone on to break the internet.It s fairly common for Seniors to celebrate their photo day with t-shirts that, when they assemble for a group photo, spell out a word or phrase. It could be the name of the school, their social group, or so on. But as AZ Central reports, this one was different:A photo shows six smiling girls standing with their arms around each other, wearing black shirts with letters written on them in gold tape that, even with asterisks in the middle, unmistakably spell out the n-word.The photo has a small circle in the corner, indicating it was originally posted to Snapchat, where photos disappear after 24 hours.The image began appearing across Facebook shortly after: What appears to have happened, is that the girls assembled for their class photo with their lettered t-shirts. In a large group, they spelled out:  Best you ve ever seen, class of 2016 . Then, a group of six girls decided to pose in a smaller photo in which they used their letters to spell out the slur.Jill Hanks, Executive Director of Community Relations for the Tempe Union High School District, which oversees Desert Vista said: That was not a school photo, That was taken off to the side somewhere and I don t know who took it or who posted it. We found out about it when everyone else did, when it popped up on social media. They do not represent DV or the community as a whole. These are six students who made a really bad decision. They do not reflect the rest of the student body, the 3,100 other students that go here, staff that work here or anyone in our district, She emphasized the class will undergo  sensitivity training  in efforts to have them understand and empathize with issues around race and history.Once  word  began to spread, a major backlash began. Over 5,000 people have signed a petition calling for the students to be expelled for racism.Petition to have the #DesertView racist high school students put up for expulsion due to their anti-Black behavior. https://t.co/fX1xvJZMcj  Melaninqua (@BlvckConscious) January 23, 2016And Twitter lit up with reaction too.Yes!

According to Atlanta Black Star:Tempe Union Superintendent Dr. Kenneth R. Baca released the following statement:The event that took place today at Desert Vista will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable for any racial slur to be used regardless of intent. We need to understand that words matter. I can assure you the appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.A letter also was sent home to Desert Vista students from Principal Dr. Christine Barela which read:Dear Desert Vista Families,We want to let you know we share your outrage and disappointment over the actions of a handful of our students today. We want to make it crystal clear those actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated at Desert Vista. Those actions do not represent who we are as a campus. We can assure you we will discipline these students in accordance with district policy and our student handbook. While we don t discuss individual discipline, we can tell you that in addition, the obvious need for sensitivity training will be addressed. As a precaution, Phoenix Police will be increasing security at and around Desert Vista.This has done little to calm tension in the area or in the press and social media.I'm tired of AZ being in the spotlight for racism! 5-day suspensions for these #DesertVista girls are NOT ENOUGH! pic.twitter.com/Uwvb8QK5G2  phxsoul (@PhxSoul) January 22, 2016It s clear that  we didn t mean anything by it  is well past its sell-by date as an excuse for this sort of racist behavior.

6678, Colbert Outs Republicans As The True Weirdos For Obsessing Over Who Goes To The Bathroom (VIDEO),"Late Show host Stephen Colbert hilariously took aim at bathroom obsessed Republicans on Tuesday night and hit the bulls-eye.Colbert began by talking about how anti-LGBT conservatives have organized a boycott of Target because the company unveiled a policy in which transgender people can use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. And then he told the audience where he stands on the issue. Here s the thing. I don t care if you re male or female, what sex or gender identity someone is, I   and I mean this sincerely   do not want to share a bathroom with anyone. For two reasons: No. 1   and No. 2,  Colbert began.Unlike Republicans, Colbert says when he goes into the restroom he has no desire to look at everyone s genitalia to ascertain whether they are transgender or not. When I am forced to use a public bathroom   which is infrequently, thank God   I go in there with blinders on. I don t know who s next to me. It could be a centaur next to me, for all I know. I don t even like to look at myself in the mirror afterwards. I know what I did. I m there for a surgical strike   get in, get out, minimal casualties. Colbert doesn t even care if a famous celebrity or a fan is standing next to him. He simply wants to do his business with no chit-chat and get the hell out. I m not there to make friends. If we ve just come out of a movie and you re standing next to me, I don t want to talk about how irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr. is as Iron Man. I don t care if you re Robert Downey Jr. yourself. Second, if you re a fan of mine   that s wonderful,  he continued.  Please don t try to shake my hand in there. Because I know what you just shook. Also, if there are a bunch of open stalls, don t take the one next to me. It s not the buddy system. With that being said, Colbert concluded that Republicans are the real weirdos for obsessing so much over who is using the bathroom and what their genitalia is. To all those lawmakers out there who are so obsessed with who s using what bathroom and what plumbing they ve got downtown   newsflash: You re the weirdos. Here s the video via YouTube.Colbert is absolutely right, of course.Republicans are not only obsessed with gay people having sex, they are obsessed with who is using the bathroom. In fact, they actually expect people to inspect the genitalia of other bathroom users and report them to authorities.Kansas Republicans recently introduced a pair of bills granting students $2,500 every time they see and report a transgender student using the bathroom, which means they would actually have to look at what each person has between their legs in order to cash-in.The fact that conservatives even thought of such bills is sickening. And considering that Republicans themselves have been arrested for misconduct in bathrooms while not a single transgender person has committed such a crime, it makes one wonder why we don t have laws banning conservatives from using public restrooms. After all, they seem to be the only ones who can t control themselves.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 27, 2016",show host aim bathroom night eye boycott target company policy people bathroom gender identity audience issue thing care sex gender identity someone share bathroom anyone desire everyone genitalia public bathroom god mirror afterwards strike get get celebrity fan business chit hell movie iron man care fan mine wonderful try hand bunch buddy system bathroom genitalia bathroom video course gay people sex bathroom fact people genitalia bathroom pair time student bathroom person order cash fact misconduct person crime wonder image
21632,BLACK WOMAN IN CHARLESTON WARNS “There’s gonna be a race war against ‘Cracka’s'”,"All the progress that s been made with race relations in America since the civil rights era has been ignored by so many angry blacks who ve bought into the carefully orchestrated Obama, Sharpton and Holder race war funded by their friend, George Soros. Since the liberal mainstream media wants to use the horrific massacre in Charleston to attack conservatives, disparage white people and act as if Dylann Roof s actions represent a normalcy, I thought it only fair to bring up the case of a black woman from Charleston, Sista Solove, who this week essentially asserted that white supremacy is leading us towards a race war against  crackas. She made the statement on Wednesday while speaking with Breitbart Texas editor Brandon Darby outside the Mother Emmanuel American Methodist Church in Charleston.When he asked her what she thinks will ultimately result from Roof s actions, she replied,  The real question is   if it were the other way around, what would that be? https://youtu.be/_o-rzGRSu8sIf a black person   if a nigga killed nine crackas, he would be dead. We wouldn t even be talking about his raggedy ass. Okay. But this cracka is,  Oh, he s mentally ill. Oh, ya know, pray for him. Oh, they ve got support systems for him.No, it s an agenda, and there s going to be a race war because it continues to happen. You cannot go pray. You can t be a child at a playground. You can t wear a hoodie with Skittles. You can t be black.What s a good nigga supposed to do, Massa? What s a good nigga supposed to do not to get shot? That s a good question, ain t it?The reason Roof happens to be alive to this day is because he complied with police orders and did not resist arrest. This places him in stark contrast to the likes of, say, Mike Brown and Eric Garner.The comment about  a child at a playground  referred to 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who died in an unfortunate incident after a bystander reported  a male sitting on a swing and pointing a gun at people.  The gun turned out to be fake, though according to reports, Rice reached for it when the cops told him to put his hands up.And as for the comment about how  you can t wear a hoodie with Skittles,  that referred to Trayvon Martin, who was justifiably shot by George Zimmerman after he attacked the guy for no legitimate reason whatsoever.Anyway. Sista Solove then delivered what Breitbart contributor Lee Stranahan accurately described as  the academic Marxist message of  white privilege  that underscores the current Black Lives Matter movement :It s called white privilege. You don t understand where our anger comes from. No one gets it. Our history comes from our family telling us,  Oh, you can t be black. Don t do this, don t go to that fountain, don t do this  and we re still dealing with this shit. What are we going to do with the anger? What are we going to do with the anger?

When the wife of the man the left has attempted to label a  sexist  (with no factual basis) arrives in Japan with the President in a couple of days, she too will have an all-female security detail. But that s still not good enough for the liberal media. Today, a female writer for the liberal rag, The Washington Post wrote an article about the all-female security detail for the First Lady and the President s daughter. The article suggests that the decision to employ an all-female security detail,   is actually kind of sexist LOL!Amanda Erickson goes on to demean an belittle the female police officers in Japan, suggesting that they aren t really properly trained to do the type of work their male counterparts are capable of doing. Near the end of the article, she throws in a jab about Michelle Obama also having an all-female detail in Japan.It s funny, but we just can t remember The Washington Post criticizing her or the female police force when Mooch made her awkward appearance in Japan, where Mooch talked about, what else? Inequality yawn!When the first daughter arrived in Japan on Thursday, she was greeted by dozens of black suit-wearing female bodyguards from Tokyo s Metropolitan Police Department.The all-female security team was deployed to protect Trump from the thousands of adoring fans she has in the Asian nation, but it seemed their usual body armor and riot gear was not fitting attire to guard Ivanka.Melania Trump and other female dignitaries will be protected by an all-woman police team during the Japan trip https://t.co/TEDsbtHC07 pic.twitter.com/Z4N7AAfN0M  CNN (@CNN) November 3, 2017 We opted for a more cultivated look to suit the occasion,  an officer in charge of the security plan told Japan s Asahi Shimbun.Wrapping up a productive day of meetings with Foreign Minister Kono, Minister Kato and Minister Noda on workforce development and women s economic empowerment.

7498, Trump Supporters Form Militia To Beat Up Protesters At Rallies Just Like Hitler’s Brownshirts (IMAGE),"Sounds like they should call themselves the Brownshirts, because that s what this group basically is.At Donald Trump rallies across the nation, his supporters have committed violence against protesters with little or no restraint   or consequences for that matter.One rally in North Carolina last week alone saw two black men get physically assaulted by racist white guys who clearly didn t care if they were being filmed or not, but they attacked their victims anyway despite not being provoked to do so. They didn t do it in self defense, but out of hatred and entitlement.Rallies in St. Louis and Chicago have nearly sparked race wars between white racists and protesters, and Trump has even led his supporters in a pledge that included the Nazi salute.Trump claims that his rallies are not violent and that no one has ever been injured at one of his events.So, it really comes as no surprise at all that a group of Trump supporters are actually forming a militia to beat up protesters who they claim are  Far-left agitators  and the real culprits committing violent acts.A group on Twitter called  Lion s Guard,  described themselves as  An informal civilian organization dedicated to protecting the safety and security of innocent, peaceful Trump supporters from violent Far-Left agitators. The group then tweeted out an invitation to other Trump supporters who would like to  forcefully protect  rallies and referred to themselves as the real victims of beatings and violence. Do you want to provide security protection to innocent people who are subject to harassment and assault by Far-left agitators? If so, you are welcome to join. That s the mission   to protect innocents who can t hire their own security guards. We are unarmed but willing to forcefully protect people if need be. We are *defensive*, *protective* of innocents who are being beaten and harassed for their political views. And then the page was taken down after the page owner received a threat, but they promised to create a website to coordinate actions the group takes.Here s a screenshot of the Twitter page via RT.Image via RTAgain, this group sounds like wannabe members of the Brownshirts who served Adolf Hitler during his rise to power in Germany, whose primary purpose was to provide protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies from those they deemed socialists and communists. At one such assembly in November 1919, Hitler s Brownshirt friends ejected hecklers by force by throwing them down the stairs. At another meeting in February 1920, dissenters who tried to shout Hitler down were violently removed. And in November 1921, a melee broke out when the Brownshirts attacked protesters during a Hitler speech.This is same kind of violence that is already occurring at Trump rallies across the country and now a group of his supporters are taking it a step further by creating a group dedicated to  forcefully  taking down protesters if a Trump supporter merely feels threatened.Trump has already been repeatedly labeled a fascist this month, and this new group only makes that label stick.

16376,YOU WON’T BELIEVE THIS! CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR’S Desperate Move To Help Elect Hillary," I wrote AB 2466 because I want to send a message to the nation that California will not stand for discrimination in voting California Gov. Jerry Brown signs bill allowing felons to vote from their jail cells pic.twitter.com/6bhKD4hOZJ  FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 29, 2016Despite widespread opposition from law enforcement, Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill that will allow thousands of felons in county jails to vote in California elections as part of an effort to speed their transition back into society.Through a representative, Brown declined to comment on the bill by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), who said it would reduce the likelihood of convicts committing new crimes. Civic participation can be a critical component of re-entry and has been linked to reduced recidivism,  Weber said when the bill was introduced.On Wednesday, Weber said California is setting an example at a time when other state s are trying to limit voting rights. I wrote AB 2466 because I want to send a message to the nation that California will not stand for discrimination in voting,  Weber said Wednesday after the bill was signed.Sen. Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) criticized the approval of the legislation, which takes effect Jan. 1.Bates said the new law will undermine the integrity of elections by allowing people in jail to decide close contest. It is very disappointing that felons still serving their sentences behind bars will now be able to vote since Governor Brown failed to veto this really bad bill,  Bates said in a statement.Read more: LA Times",Government News,"Sep 29, 2016",message nation discrimination jerry bill jail twitter fox opposition law enforcement jerry bill county part effort transition society brown bill weber likelihood participation component entry recidivism weber bill weber example time state message nation discrimination weber bill approval legislation effect law integrity people jail contest governor brown bill statement read times
22202,NOTHING NEW: ‘Fake’ & Weaponized News Has Long Haunted Our War-Weary World," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, and due to our readers  engagement on this important issue, 21WIRE is extending its #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign for additional week, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media s  fake news  assembly line  Hearst vs Pulitzer battle for the yellow journalism title (Image Source: US Library of Congress)Mark Anderson 21st Century WireToday s  fake news crisis is by no means a recent phenomenon born during the Presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, as the mainstream media would have us believe, even while big media outlets hypocritically label alternative news outlets as the sole source of fake news.Not only is America suffering under the maliciously misleading fake news peddled by today s  mainstream  media; America and the world also have gravely suffered, at least since the mid-19th Century, under an orthodox media that was   and remains   a weaponized menace to peace and social concord. There is hardly a more unsettling example of an early war-mongering media figure than famed editor Horace Greeley.Stepping back for a moment, it s notable that the liberal-internationalist New York Times  unlike liberal-left street protestors who typically march against U.S. military intervention in foreign lands   has long interpreted liberalism quite differently on the geopolitical level. Our esteemed  newspaper of record  spanning three centuries, has frequently used its pages to call for, justify or not seriously challenge claims made by governments as the pretext for highly questionable military interventions. This has led to the current reality of perpetual, unwinnable  conflicts  that are prosecuted without even the pretense of Congress officially declaring war as the Constitution requires.And pesky facts   such as the reality that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein never possessed the kind or quantity of  weapons of mass destruction  to excuse the U.S.-led coalition s March 2003  shock and awe  intervention in Iraq   have never been allowed to obstruct the Times  support for Iraq and subsequent wars. The role of the Times, along with its staff reporter Judith Miller, in presenting the false case for that war is well documented. In addition to this, a tertiary story that Saddam Hussein was hosting al Qaeda terrorists and he have been involved in the 9/11 attacks of 2001, was concocted by members of the Bush Administration and then injected into both the US and British mainstream media.All that was needed was somebody to hate in the true Orwellian tradition, so the military-industrial-banking-intelligence-media complex gave Americans Iraq as the phony target of their revenge.DRUMMING-UP A  CIVIL  WARAll told, the Times  famous slogan,  All the News That s Fit to Print  might just as well be:  All the Wars That Are Fit to Fight. So, it s all the more ironic that of all newspapers, the New York Times, on July 28, 2011, in a respectable article by James M. Lundberg, clearly outlined (in accordance with other sources) Horace Greeley s unhinged Times-style actions to help propel the U.S. into an incredibly bloody war against itself   the grossly misnamed  Civil War.  (A civil war is that in which two or more factions fight for control of a government, while this war involved southern states seceding from the Union to form another government. Big media and court historians don t even bother using correct terms.)19th Century media mogul Horace Greeley.Horace Greeley (1811-1872) founded and edited the widely influential New York Tribune. Having served briefly as a congressman from New York, he also was the new Liberal Republican Party s unsuccessful candidate in the 1872 presidential election against incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant  the celebrated Union general whose military actions were partly made possible by Greeley s poison pen. To Greeley, the pen was not mightier than the sword; rather, his pen was a sword, wielded in zealous pursuit of a fratricidal war that ended up solidifying federal dominance over the several states.Under the robber barons of Greeley s day (who would later foist a central bank on America, based on several economic  panics  that the big newspapers hyped, instilling widespread fear) such federal dominance became an enduring debt slavery that, to this day, has arguably made all Americans into perpetual serfs under the yoke of compound interest, massive taxes and endless toil. And Greeley s fingerprints are all over that bleak outcome, however unwitting he may have been about it.Greeley and the Tribune railed over the South s black agrarian slavery and urged the North to take up arms to  end  such servitude, while northern media moguls kept extremely quiet about the slavery of children working in northern factories.Lundberg noted,  It didn t take long for Horace Greeley, the nation s most loved, hated and widely read newspaper editor, to become impatient with the progress of the war. From the moment news of Major Robert Anderson s [northern] surrender at Fort Sumter reached New York City, drumbeats and bugle calls for immediate military action could be heard in the columns of Greeley s paper, the New York Tribune. Greeley and his deputies, while ignoring the towering task that others would have to undertake to prepare for the anticipated titanic collision of military forces, poured his messianic vision into the Tribune s pages to sway the people toward war, although even President Lincoln himself was not yet on  the same page  as Greeley. But the delusional Mr. Greeley would not settle for a mere sovereign making his own decisions. Never mind the logistical challenge of assembling, arming and training a suitable military force   the people, or at least the [Tribune] editors, were ready, and there was hardly a moment to lose. What appeared to be lacking, from Greeley s perspective, was a necessary vigor from President Lincoln and his administration,  Lundberg wrote.  Within a week of Lincoln s initial call for volunteers on April 15, 1861, the Tribune was already sharply critical of [Lincoln s] apparent sluggishness. Greeley gloated that the  People  supposedly stood ready to fight  with old flint-lock muskets if [they] can get no better.  But, he wondered,  Will the government stand by the People?  And before April was out and military operations still hadn t started, Greeley, casting objectivity aside and seeking the dehumanization of the South, was reminding Lincoln:  We are at war with these pestilent rebels and traitors,  while urging  heavy and instantaneous blows at Maryland and Virginia. The manipulation of the narrative did not end there. Greeley even called for the absolute conquest of the South on the first of May, 1861.  We mean to conquer them,  he blathered,  and we shall do this most mercifully, the more speedily we do it.  Who could argue with an offer as gracious as merciful conquest?As Lundberg explained, Greeley believed  the Union could be saved and much bloodshed spared with swift, decisive Federal action. And swift, decisive action would be effective because the Rebels were weak, disorganized and unlikely to fight if their cause of independence appeared lost.  Moreover, Greeley believed that  secession had been the work of a small minority of fire-eating fanatics; a quick blow and a little taste of the full force of the Union Army would embolden the silent majority of Southern Unionists he believed had yet to be roused. But it was easy for Greeley, who couldn t have had the slightest idea how this clash of arms would turn out, to assume from the safety of his desk that bloodshed could be spared by a quick attack. Such a large-scale battle of Americans against Americans   brother against brother, fathers against sons in some cases, reddening U.S. soil itself on such a huge scale   was an unprecedented, utterly unpredictable thing. If sparing bloodshed was to be the goal, then avoiding war would have been the prudent path. But poisoning public opinion via newsprint, in favor of war, would make war appear unavoidable on both sides of the conflict.Greeley, having seriously injured himself chopping wood on his Chappaqua Farm, tapped Fitz Henry Warren, a Washington correspondent, to watch over the newspaper. Warren promptly filed a trembling dispatch, describing Union forces in ultra-glowing terms. And while Greeley popularized the well-known words  Go West, young man  in the days of westward expansion and the opportunities it afforded, another phrase that historians associate with Greeley s newspaper was born in latter May of 1861:  On to Richmond! But according to Lundberg, it was Warren who sired that refrain and also declared:  Unloose your chivalry, Man of high command . . . pierce the vitals of Virginia, and scourge the serpent seed of her rebellion on the crowning heights of Richmond. Keep in mind that the simmering North-South conflict hadn t yet morphed into a full-blown war, even as Greeley s paper agitated for all-out war and never allowed for cooler heads to prevail. For many, the unavoidable question is: Whose war was this? The Union s? Or the New York Tribune s?Warren wasn t the only Tribune staffer to escalate the nation into full-blown war. The  On to Richmond!  slogan, which at first was printed in the Tribune s tiny type within dense columns of war correspondence, was given new life with slightly different wording by the Tribune s Charles A. Dana about a month later. As Lincoln and his commanders continued careful deliberations, Dana recklessly threw the paper s full weight behind Warren s idea that Richmond must be taken immediately. Beginning June 28, the paper s masthead bore in boldface what Dana called:THE NATION S WAR-CRY Forward to Richmond! Forward to Richmond! The Rebel Congress must not be allowed to meet there on the 20th of July! BY THAT DATE THE PLACE MUST BE HELD BY THE NATIONAL ARMY!Greeley did come to his senses a little. He soon came to regret his subordinates  choice of words when the Union s push toward Richmond became the deadly debacle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 following the approximate schedule that had been urged by the Tribune. Furious rebuttals against Greeley came from the Northern public and some press, as saner minds saw the travesty of the situation at a time when unlike today mainstream news journals were not so centrally controlled and offered a reasonable divergence of opinion.As Lundberg related,  Henry Jarvis Raymond s Times blasted the  insane clamor  of  certain reckless journals  and their  senseless and incessant cry  of  Onward to Richmond. But the Albany Evening Journal, offered an especially precise appraisal:  The  on to Richmond  dictators [emphasis added] have added another year to the war, a hundred millions of dollars to its cost, and opened graves for fifteen or twenty thousand more soldiers. The Albany paper, perhaps not realizing the full import of its own words, had pinpointed what Greeley s Tribune had become   a weaponized media, which would become the norm in the mainstream media as the 19th Century gave way to the 20th Century, and into the 21st Century.WAVERING FALSE FLAGSThe great  unmentionable,  however, is something that this New York Times account of Greeley s exploits did not address and which the Times will always avoid altogether: That the South s April 1861 attack on a Union military outpost at Fort Sumter, S.C., which provided the initial push toward the  Civil War,  would be a harbinger of things to come   in that it was a type of  false flag  operation, clandestinely arranged by the White House to maneuver the South into firing the first shot, the same basic model used against Japan in the lead-up to Pearl Harbor 80 years later.And less than 40 years later, when the American battleship USS Maine, on Feb. 15, 1898, was destroyed in Havana harbor, the media s lack of seeking accurate knowledge as to exactly what blew up the ship gave leading 19th Century newspapermen the platform they needed to instead detonate  information bombs , once again, instilling fear and overriding wiser counsel in order to blame Spain, and catapulting the U.S. into the Spanish-American War   the first international-scale war that set the dangerous precedent of constant U.S. military patrols and interventionism across the world.The leading fake news figures of that era who so inflamed public opinion toward that war are still household names: William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, the latter being the namesake of the famed Pulitzer Prize in Journalism.  These two moguls, who became emblematic of the era of sensationalized  Yellow Journalism , competed to see who could better ratchet up war fever against Spain.Hearst, on whom the movie Citizen Kane was loosely based, with Orson Wells playing the media mogul, was an especially reckless newsman. Ironically, Hearst had developed his passion for journalism in his early 20s and wrote for the Harvard Lampoon while a college student before working as an apprentice for the New York World s editor, none other than future rival Joseph Pulitzer.  Hearst s father had become wealthy from Western mining interests, so the younger Hearst was able to use his dad s backing to acquire the New York Journal. As Hearst sought to gain readership for his New York Journal against Pulitzer s New York World, he pursued increasingly sensational stories,  author and history teacher Ian C. Friedman noted online.   Front pages shouted about the boy who bit into a stick of dynamite thinking it was candy and leading to an  awful death,  and a tale of a deranged girl running down a street with her hair  all ablaze,  and other stories of violence, sex, catastrophe, and mayhem were typical of what became known as yellow journalism, so named because the newly-introduced colored comics sections often spread [yellow ink] to other parts of these newspapers. Hearst s penchant for publishing fake or exaggerated stuff as if it s  real  or accurate was given full reign as he angled for an ill-advised, pointless U.S. intervention in Cuba. In so doing, he took the forbidden leap from journalism to war participation. [He] was persistent in finding ways to achieve it, including organizing a daring and successful rescue mission to free a young, female Cuban political prisoner, Evangelina Cisneros, which he proudly trumpeted on the front page of the Journal,  Friedman added.  Though the Cuban insurrection against their Spanish rulers was stagnating, Hearst continued to send many of his high-profile writers and illustrators to the Cuba in hopes of capturing a great story.  Among Hearst s employees was the famed illustrator Frederic Remington.  In 1897, Remington became very bored by the lack of anything newsworthy in Cuba and cabled to Hearst,  Everything quiet. There is no trouble here. There will be no war. Wish to return. Responding to Remington s message, Hearst famously replied,  Please remain.  You furnish the pictures and I ll furnish the war. Less than three weeks later, the USS Maine exploded in Havana s harbor. The cause of the explosion that claimed 274 lives remains a mystery to this day.  Theories include that the ship detonated an external mine; that the blast was caused by an undetected internal coal fire; that it was attacked by the Spanish; and even that it was intentionally attacked under a clandestine American operation to force the U.S. into the war on false pretenses.Clearly, if we do not know what happened to the Maine even now, then Hearst certainly did not know what happened at the time of the explosion, yet he published headlines such as,  CRISIS AT HAND . . . SPANISH TREACHERY . . . Maine Destroyed by An Outside Attack, Naval Officers Believe. Other  war first, ask questions later, if ever  situations would follow. The May 1915 sinking of the British passenger ship Lusitania, which, having been secretly loaded with munitions, is thought to have been used as bait to help spark World War I. And even if the German U-Boat which sank her was not directly  baited,  the British admiralty, in tandem with the American admiralty, knowingly and willfully let that ship leave New York loaded with munitions, bound for   shark-infested  waters (German U-boats). Yet the existence of the munitions was not officially admitted until 1982.Nearly 1,200 unwitting passengers and the crew perished in an event that shifted American opinion against Germany, priming the pump for the U.S. to enter the war.Moreover, gutsy historian John Toland and retired sailor and researcher Robert Stinnett, among others, exposed the FDR Administration with reams of evidence demonstrating how Washington DC knowingly baited the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor, an event which sparked U.S. entry into World War II (and also for treacherously denying Pearl Harbor s commanders any warning of the coming attack).Stinnett, who earned 10 battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation in World War II and was in the same naval aerial photography group as George H.W. Bush, was no flunky. His book on Pearl Harbor,  Day of Deceit  absolutely destroys those who hopelessly cling to the  surprise attack  narrative, which still includes the deceitful big media.There was also the second of the two Gulf of Tonkin incidents on Aug. 4, 1964, in which North Vietnamese forces allegedly fired upon the U.S. Naval vessels. But an in-depth U.S. Naval Institute review found that the Aug. 4 incident, which was the turning point that led to full U.S. involvement in the Vietnam conflict, never happened.  There was not a second attack on U.S. Navy ships in the Tonkin Gulf in early August 1964. Furthermore, the evidence suggests a disturbing and deliberate attempt by Secretary of Defense McNamara to distort the evidence and mislead Congress,  the USNI concluded.Congress, without a responsibly skeptical press to rely upon, soon passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to cement the U.S. into what became the Vietnam nightmare. But no formal war declaration ever occurred.TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE? Yet, as increasingly more people in our Internet age ask harder questions and finally discover the truth about all these watershed events, only mainstream editors, reporters and court historians, with rare exceptions, believe the old official narratives anymore narratives which ushered America into wars in such a manner that war has become a permanent fixture in U.S. geo-politics.Put another way, the Western press has not only utterly failed to stop the power of government from ballooning into a perpetual war machine   despite institutional claims that it  speaks truth to power    the mainstream media has been a major agent in justifying and escalating wars, without ever acknowledging its dreadful history of doing so. Covering-up real history and failing to consider other viewpoints and correct the record is arguably another form of fake, weaponized news because it denies the world a full reckoning of its past, thereby making future wars much more likely.Instead, an honest look at history shows, with only minor exceptions, that the mainstream orthodox press of yesteryear laid the groundwork long ago for the modern centralized news institution that relishes in  fear porn    supporting ongoing war, mayhem and grave economic uncertainty by covering up past and present realities, avoiding solutions and constantly recycling the corrosive narratives that go nowhere and cause real, lasting harm and have put, and continue to put, large swaths of humanity into early graves.*** Author Mark Anderson is an investigative journalist and features writer for American Free Press, and is editor of The Truth Hound.

22949,NEOCON FILES: The Kagans Are Back – Wars to Follow,"Consortium News Exclusive: The neocon royalty Kagans are counting on Democrats and liberals to be the foot soldiers in the new neocon campaign to push Republicans and President Trump into more  regime change  wars  Robert Perry Consortium News The Kagan family, America s neoconservative aristocracy, has reemerged having recovered from the letdown over not gaining its expected influence from the election of Hillary Clinton and from its loss of official power at the start of the Trump presidency.Back pontificating on prominent op-ed pages, the Family Kagan now is pushing for an expanded U.S. military invasion of Syria and baiting Republicans for not joining more enthusiastically in the anti-Russian witch hunt over Moscow s alleged help in electing Donald Trump.In a Washington Post op-ed on March 7, Robert Kagan (photo,left), a co-founder of the Project for the New American Century and a key architect of the Iraq War, jabbed at Republicans for serving as  Russia s accomplices after the fact  by not investigating more aggressively.Then, Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the neocon American Enterprise Institute, and his wife, Kimberly Kagan, president of her own think tank, Institute for the Study of War, touted the idea of a bigger U.S. invasion of Syria in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on March 15.Yet, as much standing as the Kagans retain in Official Washington s world of think tanks and op-ed placements, they remain mostly outside the new Trump-era power centers looking in, although they seem to have detected a door being forced open.Still, a year ago, their prospects looked much brighter. They could pick from a large field of neocon-oriented Republican presidential contenders or   like Robert Kagan   they could support the establishment Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, whose  liberal interventionism  matched closely with neoconservatism, differing only slightly in the rationalizations used for justifying wars and more wars.There was also hope that a President Hillary Clinton would recognize how sympatico the liberal hawks and the neocons were by promoting Robert Kagan s neocon wife, Victoria Nuland (photo, left), from Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to Secretary of State.Then, there would have been a powerful momentum for both increasing the U.S. military intervention in Syria and escalating the New Cold War with Russia, putting  regime change  back on the agenda for those two countries. So, early last year, the possibilities seemed endless for the Family Kagan to flex their muscles and make lots of money.A Family BusinessAs I noted two years ago in an article entitled  A Family Business of Perpetual War :  Neoconservative pundit Robert Kagan and his wife, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, run a remarkable family business: she has sparked a hot war in Ukraine and helped launch Cold War II with Russia and he steps in to demand that Congress jack up military spending so America can meet these new security threats. This extraordinary husband-and-wife duo makes quite a one-two punch for the Military-Industrial Complex, an inside-outside team that creates the need for more military spending, applies political pressure to ensure higher appropriations, and watches as thankful weapons manufacturers lavish grants on like-minded hawkish Washington think tanks. Not only does the broader community of neoconservatives stand to benefit but so do other members of the Kagan clan, including Robert s brother Frederick at the American Enterprise Institute and his wife Kimberly, who runs her own shop called the Institute for the Study of War. But things didn t quite turn out as the Kagans had drawn them up. The neocon Republicans stumbled through the GOP primaries losing out to Donald Trump and then   after Hillary Clinton muscled aside Sen. Bernie Sanders to claim the Democratic nomination   she fumbled away the general election to Trump.After his surprising victory, Trump   for all his many shortcomings   recognized that the neocons were not his friends and mostly left them out in the cold. Nuland not only lost her politically appointed job as Assistant Secretary but resigned from the Foreign Service, too Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE NEOCON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NeoCon FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"March 17, 2017",consortium news royalty foot campaign president trump change consortium news family aristocracy letdown influence election loss power start trump presidency family invasion anti witch hunt help trump post march photo founder project century architect war jabbed russia fact director enterprise institute wife president think tank institute study war idea invasion street journal march standing world think trump era power door year field establishment candidate interventionism president wife photo secretary state secretary state momentum intervention war russia regime change agenda year endless family lots money family article family business war pundit wife assistant secretary state family business war war russia congress jack spending security husband wife duo punch complex inside team need spending pressure community clan brother enterprise institute wife shop institute study war trump sanders nomination election victory trump job assistant secretary service story consortium news century wire subscribe member

16937,95 YR OLD WWII VETERAN Writes Scathing Letter To Obama: “I can’t figure out what country you’re the president of”,"When WWII veteran and Pearl Harbor resident, Harold Estes wrote this letter, he was a retired Master Chief Boatswains Mate. He died on May 7, 2011. This is the most amazing and honest letter to our Community Organizer In Chief that you will ever read. Although this letter was written in 2009, its content is surprisingly still very timely. He discusses Obama s disdain for our police, military and America in general and even addresses his warped views on race in America. Enjoy Dear President Obama,My name is Harold Estes, approaching 95 on December 13 of this year. People meeting me for the first time don t believe my age because I remain wrinkle free and pretty much mentally alert.I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1934 and served proudly before, during and after WW II retiring as a Master Chief Bos n Mate. Now I live in a  rest home  located on the western end of Pearl Harbor allowing me to keep alive the memories of 23 years of service to my country.One of the benefits of my age, perhaps the only one, is to speak my mind, blunt and direct even to the head man.So here goes.I am amazed, angry and determined not to see my country die before I do but you seem hell bent not to grant me that wish.I can t figure out what country you are the president of. You fly around the world telling our friends and enemies despicable lies like: We re no longer a Christian nation   America is arrogant    (Your wife even announced to the world,  America is mean-spirited.  Please tell her to try preaching that nonsense to 23 generations of our war dead buried all over the globe who died for no other reason than to free a whole lot of strangers from tyranny and hopelessness.) I d say shame on the both of you but I don t think you like America nor do I see an ounce of gratefulness in anything you do for the obvious gifts this country has given you. To be without shame or gratefulness is a dangerous thing for a man sitting in the White House.After 9/11 you said,  America hasn t lived up to her ideals.  Which ones did you mean?1. Was it the notion of personal liberty that 11,000 farmers and shopkeepers died for to win independence from the British ?2. Or maybe the ideal that no man should be a slave to another man that 500,000 men died for in the Civil War?3. I hope you didn t mean the ideal 470,000 fathers, brothers, husbands, and a lot of fellahs I knew personally died for in WWII, because we felt real strongly about not letting any nation push us around because we stand for freedom.4. I don t think you mean the ideal that says equality is better than discrimination. You know the one that a whole lot of white people understood when they helped to get you elected.Take a little advice from a very old geezer, young man. Shape up and start acting like an American. If you don t, I ll do what I can to see you get shipped out of that fancy rental on Pennsylvania Avenue. You were elected to lead not to bow, apologize and kiss the hands of murderers and corrupt leaders who still treat their people like slaves.And just who do you think you are telling the American people not to jump to conclusions and condemn that Muslim major who killed 13 of his fellow soldiers and wounded dozens more. You mean you don t want us to do what you did when that white cop used force to subdue that black college professor in Massachusetts who was putting up a fight? You don t mind offending the police calling them stupid but you don t want us to offend Muslim fanatics by calling them what they are, terrorists.One more thing. I realize you never served in the military and never had to defend your country with your life but you re the Commander-in-Chief now, son. Do your job. When your battle-hardened field General asks you for 40,000 more troops to complete the mission, give them to him. But if you re not in this fight to win, then get out. The life of one American soldier is not worth the best political strategy you re thinking of.You could be our greatest president because you face the greatest challenge ever presented to any president.You re not going to restore American greatness by bringing back our bloated economy. That s not our greatest threat. Losing the heart and soul of who we are as Americans is our big fight now. And I sure as hell don t want to think my president is the enemy in this final battle.Sincerely,Harold B. EstesHarold B. Estes and many of his peers are part of a generation that is known as  The Greatest Generation.  Estes, a World War II veteran credited with helping bring the USS Missouri and Bowfin museums to Hawaii, and who gained Internet fame with a letter written to President Barack Obama telling him to  shape up and start acting like an American,  died Tuesday May 17, 2011.Bringing the battleship Missouri to Pearl Harbor started as an idea tossed around in 1994 by Estes, retired Adm. Ron Hays and Navy veteran Edwin Carter, according to the museum.Estes served over 20 years in the Navy. He took to the Navy like the proverbial duck takes to the water. Estes loved the Navy and the Navy returned that love. His first ship was the battleship California, later sunk at Pearl Harbor.Estes was a true gentleman. He didn t have a political bone in his body, and he loved America and his fellow veterans.A letter critical of Obama penned by Estes several years ago went viral on the Internet and references to it are still numerous.",Government News,"Dec 7, 2015",veteran pearl harbor resident letter master chief letter community organizer chief letter content disdain police race president name year people time age navy retiring master chief mate rest home end harbor service country age one mind blunt head man country die figure country president world nation wife world please nonsense war globe reason lot tyranny hopelessness shame ounce gratefulness anything country shame gratefulness thing man house notion liberty independence ideal man slave man men war ideal lot nation push freedom ideal equality discrimination one lot people advice geezer man shape rental avenue apologize people people condemn cop force college professor fight mind police thing country life commander chief job battle field mission fight life soldier strategy president challenge president greatness economy threat heart soul fight sure hell president enemy battle part generation generation world war veteran bowfin fame letter president battleship harbor idea veteran carter museum navy navy duck water navy navy ship battleship sunk harbor gentleman bone body letter

12972,BREAKING: NYC BOMBING SUSPECT ARRESTED After Shooting NJ Cop!,"Ahmad Rahami has been identified as a suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings over the weekend, and he has been taken into custody Monday after shooting a police officer in Linden, New Jersey, around 11 a.m.Thankfully the officer injuries are non-life-threatening, a senior official told NBC News. Two sources said that Rahami had also been shot and is on the way to a local hospital.This Saturday, a bomb exploded in the New Jersey shore town on Seaside Park, forcing a large charity race to cancel. Later the same day, a bombing in New York s Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people. Officers found a possible secondary device nearby. Then on Sunday, five additional explosive devices were found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Rahami, a 28-year-old Afghan-born U.S. citizen, was identified as a suspect on Monday in the bombings after authorities found a fingerprint on one of the devices that had not been detonated.The suspect was sleeping in the doorway of a local bar when the bar owner happened to recognize him and called 911.  The police approached Rahami and he sat up. The officer recognized him and told him to put his hands up. Rhami then shot the officer in the stomach but the officer was wearing a bullet proof vest so his injuries are thankfully minor. Rahami ran and started shooting at cars and passersby when he was shot and then taken into custody.  The story is developing.Obama didn t comment on the breaking story at his news conference. He also never mentioned the suspect during the short press conference.H/T [ NY Daily ] ",politics,"Sep 19, 2016",suspect york jersey weekend custody police officer jersey officer life official news way hospital bomb jersey shore town seaside park charity race day york neighborhood people device explosive train station jersey year citizen suspect fingerprint suspect doorway bar bar owner police officer officer stomach officer bullet proof vest ran custody story comment story news conference suspect press conference
15767,[VIDEO] LEFTIST CNN ANCHOR TELLS RACIST US REP THE #BaltimoreRiots Are Vets Fault “They come back from war…and they’re ready to do battle”,"Whiskey, Tango, Hotel   Don t worry, Brooke clarified her ludicrous statement by saying:  These veterans are coming back from war and they just don t know their communities.  Yeah okay thanks for clarifying Brooke Radical leftist and open racist, Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings appears to have the answer however, he s got the DOJ involved in an investigation from  top to bottom  of the Baltimore Police Department. Once their shake-down is complete, the racist crackers will be outed, they ll be fired  and everyone can go back to business. As usual, where s there s a Democrat, there s a taxpayer funded government solution As if it s not hard enough to have to watch racist Democrat, US Rep. Elijah Cummings offer his  expert opinion  on the Baltimore riots/race war he s just giddy about we now have to listen to leftist CNN  reporter  Brooke Baldwin tell us these riots are the fault of our returning US Veterans How much more idiocy can America take? Here s a great example of a courageous US Veteran who stood tall last night in the face of a large group of thugs who were threatening the Baltimore Police with rocks and other projectiles.  Is this who you were referring to Brooke?Here s the original interview with US Rep. Elijah Cummins:After more than a year of CNN pouring gasoline all over America with hysterical, and oftentimes phony, stories of American racism, the left-wing network s afternoon anchor Brooke Baldwin finally took it to the next level by blaming American veterans for the Baltimore riots.In a pathetic suck-up interview with Democrat Congressman Elijah Cummins, Baldwin never once had the moral courage to ask the failed Baltimore City congressman if the left-wing policies ushered in by a half-century of a Democrat monopoly in Baltimore might have something to do with the city s ills. Instead, she said of young military veterans who become police officers,  I love our nation s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don t know the communities, and they are ready to do battle. The context was a discussion about increased training and retraining for the Baltimore police.There s no question Baldwin is hoping to launch a narrative with that smear.This is pure CNN; throwing out anti-science smears towards the best people this country has to offer while it is in reality the rioters who are  doing battle.  It is savages who are looting and burning and causing anarchy, not the police. But it is the Baltimore police who have 15 wounded among their ranks. It is the Baltimore police who calmly did not do much battle during Monday night s riots.Baldwin and CNN just can t help themselves. This is a cable news network that relentlessly launches Hate Campaigns to smear decent people, like Christians, as a way to deflect from the evils done by the Gaystapo and the thugs who are tearing down predominantly black, working class cities like Ferguson and Baltimore.Essentially, what Baldwin said to the world was,  Don t hire veterans! They re too damaged to be trusted with authority.  We re back to the Vietnam-era where leftists smear our heroes to cover up the real problems. CNN wants us to believe unstable veterans are the problem in Baltimore, not unstable families.But she loves veterans.Here s a great follow up interview with Mr. Valentine, the fearless veteran the residents in the city of Baltimore are fortunate enough to have living amongst them:Wine and live television tend to reveal just how ugly some people really are.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 28, 2015",hotel statement war thanks leftist racist democrat rep answer investigation police department shake racist crackers everyone business democrat taxpayer government solution racist opinion race war reporter fault example veteran night face group police interview year gasoline racism left wing network afternoon anchor level suck interview congressman courage city congressman left century democrat monopoly something city nation war battle context discussion training police question smear science people country reality battle anarchy police police police battle night cable news network people way class world hire authority era problem follow interview fearless city television tend people news

5217, WATCH: Obama DRAGS Trump In Epic Fashion On The World Stage,"President Obama let loose on Donald Trump, describing the Republican presidential nominee as simply unfit to serve as President of the United States.In a press conference at the White House alongside the Prime Minister of Singapore, Obama as asked about Trump s attack on the family of deceased Army Captain Humayun Khan.""The Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president,"" President Obama says https://t.co/wjCjJOvbM5 https://t.co/fb5yN5gmpq  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) August 2, 2016President Obama said: The Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a gold star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country. The fact that he doesn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues, in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia, means that he s woefully unprepared to do this job. Obama s comments come as Trump has piled one screw-up on top of another, from attacking the Khan family, erroneously stating that Russia never invaded Crimea, going after local fire marshals, and calling Hillary Clinton the  devil. On Tuesday morning Trump even made light of Purple Heart winners as a supporter gave him a replica and Trump laughed about how  easy  it was to get one. The incident occurred as a New York Times report examined Trump s claims of how he avoided serving in the Vietnam War and found that he has made multiple contradictory excuses over the years for how he stayed out of the conflict.His campaign is also in trouble. Trump recently fired two senior staffers, including the man who put together the B-list celebrities who appeared at the Republican Convention.By contrast, Hillary Clinton has seen an uptick in her polling after the convention. CNN recorded the biggest post-convention bounce they ve polled since 2000, with the new CNN/ORC poll showing her 9% ahead of him, 52% to 43%. NBC found a similar result.

7092, Fox News Host DESTROYS His Colleagues For Kissing Donald Trump’s Ring (TWEETS),"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld has taken to Twitter to vent his rage at senior Fox hosts for treating GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with kid gloves, and he got brutal.Gutfeld made his remarks in response to the Republican Town Hall on Sunday night, and he was not pulling any punches.

Of course, it s hard to feel too sorry for Gutfeld, working for an organization which cares so little for the facts, that it s viewers have been found to be less informed than those who watch no news at all.

2759," BREAKING: Trump DEVASTATED, Drops Anti-LGBT Executive Order After Facing Public Outrage (DETAILS)","If the halting of Donald Trump s disgusting Muslim ban was any indication, Trump is quickly learning that the American people will do whatever it takes to stop his tyranny from infringing upon the true values of America and the constitutional rights of every citizen.Recently, the Trump administration tried to move forward with an executive order attacking LGBTQ rights, and was forced to drop it after America responded with an onslaught of backlash and criticism. Facing immediate public outcry, the White House released a statement: President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he was throughout the election. The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression. The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump. Of course, the statement makes zero mention of the fact that Trump might create another executive order that would allow for workplace discrimination. However, Trump s draft of his halted executive order would have allowed employers to fire workers based on their sexual orientation, and would have allowed federally funded adoption and social service agencies to discriminate against the LGBT community. Federal employees would have also been able to refuse service to LGBT individuals. With that being said, it s hilarious that the White House s statement talks about how  respectful  and  supportive  Trump is when it comes to LGBT rights. But regardless, we re just fortunate that he s been stopped in his tracks.Trump s tyranny is terrifying, but one small silver lining that shouldn t be forgotten is the fact that he is so thin-skinned and sensitive. His narcissism and desperate need for approval make him more easily swayed to public pressure, and public protests bother him more than anything else. The media was swift in reporting Trump s executive order draft before he could sign it, and the public worked just as fast to express outrage. This takes away significant power from Trump, as it is truly humiliating for him to receive so much backlash on the world stage. We need to keep this momentum going, and build upon the resistance we ve already seen   because it is working.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"January 31, 2017",halting trump ban indication trump people tyranny citizen trump administration executive order onslaught backlash criticism outcry house statement president trump community president trump election president nominee community nomination acceptance speech community violence oppression executive order workplace discrimination direction president trump course statement mention fact trump executive order workplace discrimination draft executive order orientation adoption service community service house statement trump tyranny silver lining fact narcissism need approval pressure anything media trump executive order draft fast outrage power trump backlash world stage momentum resistance image pool
4022, Gary Johnson Has ANOTHER Insanely Incoherent Meltdown During Interview (VIDEO),"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson isn t doing too well in the polls, and a recently released interview is not going to help him. Apparently, Johnson is beginning to feel the pressure and he s taking it out on the press by giving unpredictable interviews   unless he s just trying to take a page out of Donald Trump s book by acting erratic.When Johnson was interviewed by the Guardian s Paul Lewis, there were several tense, uncomfortable moments   such as when he yelled at Lewis for mentioning his dwindling poll numbers or questioning his tax policy.The interview begins on an awfully uneasy note when Johnson flat-out admits to Lewis that he s stupid while sporting a very creepy smile   and it s clear that Lewis doesn t understand if Johnson s being serious or not. The interview is confusing from the start, as Johnson doesn t seem focused or able to control his mood.The worst part was toward the end of the interview when Lewis corrected Johnson that his support in the polls was now only 6%, not the 10% that Johnson claimed. Johnson responded by blowing up and yelling: Why are you even interviewing me? I don t get it. If I m doing so poorly, is this to preside over a funeral here? It s not a funeral! It s a celebration! Another horrible moment came when Lewis asked Johnson to explain his tax plan. Lewis brought up the fact that most economists disagree with Johnson s approach to nix federal income tax and enforce nationwide consumption tax   which made Johnson unravel right in front of the camera. Johnson admitted that Congress wouldn t approve of his tax plan, and then fired back with a weird detour about legalized marijuana: Look, I don t want to argue. I don t want to argue, really. Look, I came out for the legalization of marijuana, let me just use that as an example. And I will tell you, I had people in my face for years and years and years talking about how stupid and idiotic it was that we should allow marijuana to be legal. Lewis was understandably shocked, and he had to ask Johnson why he d bring up marijuana when they d been talking about taxes. Johnson yelled,  It s leadership!

4433," BREAKING: Lawsuit Shows Trump Wanted To Fire, Replace ‘Unattractive’ Female Employees","While Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway continue to boast about how uplifting and fair the billionaire mogul has been to his female employees (hiring, promotions, large salaries), court documents obtained from the Los Angeles Times paint a more sinister, misogynistic view into how Trump really felt about female employees.In other words, it highlights exactly the kind of person Trump is and just how he treats women.According to the court documents, Hayley Strozier, director of catering at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, accused Trump of asking managers to fire  unattractive  waitresses and replacing them with  attractive  ones instead:I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were  not pretty enough  and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women.Other court documents from 2012 document that Trump had asked Sue Kwiatkowski that his premises in Los Angeles should showcase only  attractive  women:Donald Trump always wanted good looking women working at the club. I know this because one time he took me aside and said,  I want you to get some good looking hostesses here. People like to see good looking people when they come in.  I and the other managers always tried to have our most attractive hostesses working when Mr. Trump was in town and going to be on the premises.In Donald Trump s America, a woman is not judged on her merit and ability to get the job done, but by her looks   and if she doesn t have the looks, she s out of a job. Because of Trump s ridiculous and sexist demands, managers were often forced to hire inexperienced, inept employees due to looks over the experienced, capable employees who didn t fit the mold of  attractive  enough.The outrage lies within one caveat: he only did this with female employees, not males. Either Trump thinks all men are drop-dead gorgeous or he really does have a blatant disregard for treating women with respect.And it s not like the ill deeds towards these women did not go unpunished. As part of a  broader labor relations lawsuit  (which includes other complaints than sexist mistreatment), Trump had to compensate:The bulk of the lawsuit was settled in 2013, when golf course management, without admitting any wrongdoing, agreed to pay $475,000 to employees who had complained about break policies. An employee s claim that she was fired after complaining about the company s treatment of women was settled separately; its terms remain confidential.If Trump really treated women with respect, why did he have to give hush money to a female employee who complained about ill-treatment of not just her, but women overall?Maybe someone should tell Kellyanne Conway before the next time she starts babbling on about how great he is.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",trump continue billionaire court times view kind person trump court director golf club trump trump tell times club restaurant court document trump sue trump club time aside people people trump town trump woman merit ability job job trump inept mold outrage caveat men disregard respect ill part labor lawsuit trump bulk lawsuit golf course management break employee claim company treatment hush money employee treatment someone time image spencer

He asked if it was significant, considering that former President George W.

It has the magnitude of the industrial revolution, but the speed of the digital revolution. We re still not changing fast enough. It s not just the scientific community warning us now.

9022, Texas ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Shoots 6-Year-Old In Spine After Family Makes Wrong Turn (VIDEO),"When Texas governor Greg Abbott said that Texans should  be tolerant  of anyone they see with a handgun in light of the state s recent decision to allow concealed carry permit holders to openly display their sidearms, one thing he didn t think about is that every single person carrying a gun isn t necessarily licensed to do so   but he effectively told residents to accept that every single handgun they see is legal because reasons.Unfortunately, this simply empowers the criminal element   after all, according to the NRA, everyone with a gun is a  good guy  who will save the world. That is, until the  good guy  rips off his mask and reveals that he was a  bad guy  all along.On Tuesday, a  bad guy with a gun  (who looks exactly like a  good guy  until he actually begins shooting) fired numerous rounds at a vehicle containing a family that had done nothing worse than make a wrong turn, severely injuring a child. The family was in the area looking for a tire shop when they became lost and pulled into the parking lot of some townhouses to reroute their GPS.According to investigators, the car s lights were shining on another car. The occupant became annoyed, walked toward the family s vehicle and fired nine shots, one of them piercing through the vehicle s taillight and striking a 6-year-old girl, the bullet lodging itself into her spine. Panicked, the driver attempted to escape as the shooter fired four more rounds at the vehicle as it exited the property. The family drove down the street to a motel and flagged down an officer. The little girl was rushed to the hospital for treatment.A SWAT team detained a person of interest who was arrested on unrelated charges, but he has still not been charged in the child s shooting according to police.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via Examiner",News,"January 2, 2016",tolerant anyone handgun light state decision permit thing think person gun handgun element everyone gun guy world guy mask guy guy gun guy vehicle family nothing turn child family area tire shop parking lot car car occupant family vehicle vehicle taillight year girl bullet spine driver shooter vehicle property family street motel officer girl hospital treatment swat team person interest child police report image examiner
3152, Republicans Vote To DEFUND The U.N. In Retaliation For One Single Issue,"House Republicans have long since made clear their dislike and disdain of the United Nations. Some of them seem to buy into conspiracy theories that the U.N. is trying to take our sovereignty away from us. Others are just idiots, and the House GOP proved that when they passed a resolution that would allow Congress to yank our funding from the U.N. over just one issue.That issue is the apartheid state of Israel, which is also home to an awful lot of human rights violations. The U.N. recently approved a resolution declaring Israel s settlements in Palestine illegal, and the U.S. abstained from that vote, so it passed 14-0. In retaliation, the GOP wants the option of yanking our financial contributions unless the U.N. does what they want.The Zionists we ve got in Congress called this resolution  anti-Israel.  Sen. Ted Cruz said: I believe Congress should end U.S. taxpayer funding for the United Nations unless and until the U.N. reverses this anti-Israel resolution, and I believe there will be considerable support in Congress, I hope in both parties, to do exactly that. The House Freedom Caucus, made up of Tea Partiers who are uber-religious, will meet next week to discuss two options: Decreasing/ending funding entirely, or making our funding voluntary   something Congress has to decide on every two years.And Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put in his two cents with: The United Nations will regret this vote and I hope the Obama Administration will realize the massive mistake they made on their way out of the door. Seriously? Yes, seriously. Worse, though, Sen. Tom  Tehran  Cotton, the architect of that ridiculous letter threatening Iran, said: Any American with any common sense knows that Senegal and Malaysia don t set the agenda for the Security Council, the United States does. And this resolution would not have gone forward if the United States did not want it to go forward. So the whole world should bow to us, including the peacekeeping United Nations. We are completely and utterly beyond reproach, at all times, in all situations. Yeah, we re that awesome. Nobody should condemn Israel for anything, ever, period, end, because they are, apparently, God.Oh, please.Never mind all the good the U.N. has done. Protecting Israel, and sending taxpayer dollars there, is so important that it s worth killing 22 percent of their budget to make a point. Israel called the vote a betrayal, and since we apparently dance to their tune (despite all conservative cries that we re a sovereign nation), we ve decided the U.N. betrayed Israel, too.Israel s settlements in Palestine are illegal, make no mistake. Republicans like to paint the U.S. as this bastion of freedom and democracy, but they like to practice that selectively. Otherwise they d condemn Israel, as the rest of the U.N. did, and that would be that.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"January 5, 2017",house dislike disdain conspiracy sovereignty house resolution congress issue issue state home lot resolution illegal vote retaliation option congress resolution sen congress taxpayer anti resolution support congress house freedom caucus tea week something congress senator graham vote administration mistake way door cotton architect letter sense agenda security council resolution world reproach times nobody anything period end please taxpayer percent budget point vote betrayal tune nation mistake bastion freedom democracy practice rest image chip
4008, Trump Supporter Kicked Out Of Trump Rally; Bet You Can Guess Why (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s popularity with African-Americans is somewhere near zero. Still, there are some African-American Trump supporters, but it appears that Trump doesn t want anything to do with them, at least not when they show up to his rallies.An African-American Trump supporter attended a rally for the GOP candidate on Wednesday in Kinston, North Carolina. Soon, Trump s other supporters began singling the man out by waving their signs in his direction. When Trump saw him, his initial response was,  That s all right, leave him alone. Then, Trump changed his mind.  We have a protester,  said the candidate to boos from the crowd.  By the Way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug? Where s the protester? Where is he? Was he paid? This was in reference to a heavily edited video by James O Keefe that supposedly implicated Democrats in sending violent agitators to Trump rallies.Then, Trump s security detail began escorting the man out of the rally, with cheers from the audience and  You can get him out. Get him out,  from Trump.Here s the video:This man was no Democratic plant, even if the Democratic plants exist. He was a longtime Trump supporter and North Carolina resident, C.J. Cary. All he wanted to do was hand the self-described billionaire a note.Cary, in a phone interview Saturday with The Washington Post, said he had gone to the rally because he wanted to hand-deliver a note to the Republican presidential nominee. He made his way to about 20 to 30 feet from the stage and was shouting  Donald!  while waving his note around to try to catch his attention. Everyone else is waving Trump signs and I m waving this white letter,  Cary, 63, said. He said that, coupled with the fact that he was wearing sunglasses during an evening rally to deal with his sensitivity to light, may have been what set people off.Source: Washington PostStrangely, Cary still wants to vote for Trump. He believes he shares a history with the businessman. Cary wrote to Trump back in 1992 when Trump was separating from Ivana. Trump allegedly wrote back. Since then, he s been a fan   a yuuuuge fan. He has about 100 Trump signs in his yard and he wants to defeat  lying Hillary and lying Obama.  Why does he like Trump? He calls him  honest,  while Trump calls him  a thug.

6231, Report: Black Women Have Become The Most Educated Group In The U.S. (VIDEO),"According to The National Center for Education Statistics, black women have recently emerged as the most educated population of people by race and gender in the United States. That makes them a powerful force in the political and business world.The NCES found that: From 1999 2000 to 2009 10, the percentage of degrees earned by females remained between approximately 60 and 62 percent for associate s degrees and between 57 and 58 percent for bachelor s degrees. In contrast, the percentages of both master s and doctor s degrees earned by females increased from 1999 2000 to 2009 10. Within each racial/ethnic group, women earned the majority of degrees at all levels in 2009 10. For example, among U.S. residents, Black females earned 68 percent of associate s degrees, 66 percent of bachelor s degrees, 71 percent of master s degrees, and 65 percent of all doctor s degrees awarded to Black students. The number of degrees that have been awarded to racial minorities in the United States has been on the rise for the past two decades. No, that doesn t mean that racial minorities are trying to take over the U.S. as I am sure many white supremacists would claim. It just means that many of the barriers that prevented black women from getting an education have begun to recede.Many people may have missed the notice due to the overwhelming amount of negative portrayals of black women in the media. According to a report in Essence from 2013, negative depictions of black women occur twice as likely as positive depictions of black women.This news comes with some caveats. Despite being the most educated bloc of people in the United States, black women are still making far less money than their white peers. There is also still only one black woman on the Forbes 500 list. That means that there is still a lot of work to be done to end the racial disparities in the United States.ATTN recently produced a video that gives a great rundown of the situation, you can watch it below.https://www.facebook.com/ATTNVideo/videos/1555955044709451/Featured image from (Photo by Erik S.

4435," The Ladies Of ‘The View’ Just STEAMROLLED Trump’s Campaign Manager, And It’s GLORIOUS (VIDEO)","It s not clear whether Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway thought she could go on The View and think she could get away with lying, but that definitely seemed to be what happened Thursday morning.While Trump still hasn t had the courage to appear on the morning talk show himself, Conway took the plunge and surrounded herself with five very opinionated ladies who haven t ever been known to hold back.Conway tried to sell the same tired lines she s been selling to cable news outlets all over the place, but the ladies weren t having it. Not. One. Bit.At one point, Whoopi Goldberg asked point blank: Where are his damn tax returns?!

Then after more lies about Trump being audited, etc. Goldberg bluntly interrupts the poppycock and says: It s bull!

369, CNN Host Abruptly Ends Segment After Fox Sports Guest Makes DISGUSTING Trump-like Comment (VIDEO),"One thing that most conservatives have in common with Donald Trump   and perhaps contributes to the reason they relate to him and supported him for POTUS   is chronic misogyny and sexism. We saw this play out on Friday during a panel discussion on CNN, when an anchor had to shut the segment down abruptly due to a highly inappropriate comment from her Fox guest.CNN s Brooke Baldwin had Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis as a guest, and the exchange went downhill very quickly. The panel was addressing the incident in which ESPN s Jemele Hill had called Trump a white supremacist, causing the White House to demand her be fired. When Clay Travis had his turn to give his opinion on the matter, he made Baldwin wish she d never asked him. Travis said this: I believe in the First Amendment and boobs. Baldwin was practically speechless, and had to do a double take, asking him if he d actually just said the word  boobs.  Travis only made it worse: Boobs, two things that never let me down, the first amendment and boobs. Those are the two things I believe in absolutely in the country. Baldwin still couldn t believe her ears, and wanted to give Travis another chance and the benefit of the doubt. She asked him once more to clarify that he d said  boobs  instead of  booze.  Once she confirmed that Travis had definitely said  boobs,  she shut the interview down right then and there. She said: I m done, I m sorry. I m done. This conversation is over, yanking mikes, bye. Forgive me, live television happens and you think you heard something, you are not sure and then you realize it happened, so I apologize for him on that. Right after the segment, Baldwin and Travis were both seen on Twitter, reacting to what had happened in two totally different ways. Baldwin seemed horrified and shocked, and Travis was, of course, proud of himself.What Travis said is not okay, and must be condemned. We re not at all surprised that this would come from a Fox employee, considering how prevalent misogyny, sexual assault, and support for our sexist POTUS is.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 15, 2017",thing trump reason misogyny play panel discussion anchor segment comment fox guest sports radio host clay travis guest exchange panel incident hill house clay travis turn opinion matter amendment take word travis amendment country travis chance benefit doubt booze travis interview sorry conversation television something right segment travis twitter ways travis course travis employee misogyny assault support image video screen capture

6949, Anonymous Posts Video Of Donald Trump That Shows How CRAZY It Would Be To Elect Him President,"Donald Trump has shown his true colors time and time again while running for the Republican nomination for the presidency. Thus far we ve discovered that he advocates for violence at his rallies, he has racist tendencies, and he says many creepy things about women, including his own daughter. While all of these factors have put a dent in his possible nomination, he still has a comfortable delegate lead and he polls well in upcoming contests. Despite the overwhelming evidence that Trump is a certified douche bag, there are voters out there who find his insanity appealing. Now comes another video that the hacker collective Anonymous posted that proves just how absurd it would be to elect this man as the representative of our country and the symbol of our nation.Watch video here:The clip was taken in 2007 at Wrestlemania, and it shows Donald Trump tackling  professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon and then beating him to the ground. Trump then triumphantly pumps his fists in the air.

6889, Watch Bill O’Reilly Lose It After A Fox News Poll Delivers Terrible News For The GOP (VIDEO),"Bill O Reilly refused to believe the findings of a poll conducted by his own news organization on Thursday night, because it was simply too bad for him to contemplate. According to the poll, Democraict candidate Bernie Sanders would beat ALL current GOP contenders for President.While endorsing all other sections of the poll, which supported his views, O Reilly flat out loses it with the section which doesn t. The section shows that that Sanders beats Trump by 14 points, Ted Cruz by 12 points, and narrowly defeats John Kasich by 4 points.  It s also not the first poll to show this sort of result.Nevertheless, O Reilly wasn t willing to tolerate such information, which flies in the face of his own views on the electability of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. He appeals to his fellow Fox News veterans Geraldo Rivera and Dana Perino to join him in denouncing the results. Rivera immediately obliges, calling the findings:  pie in the sky,  while Perino makes sympathetic noises.But it s not enough to quell the perplexed O Reilly, who turns to camera saying: I don t believe it, And I have to say, with all due respect the Fox News poll has been good I don t believe this. I just don t. The incident is a perfect example of the phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. As Chris Mooney explains in Mother Jones:the concept of cognitive dissonance has been well established in psychology and even, to some extent, embedded in public consciousness. Basically, when the mind is faced with an idea that is threatening to one s identity or sense of self an idea that induces unpleasant dissonance one tends to try to either avoid the thought or, perhaps, reinterpret it into something unthreatening or positive.This urge is also known to affect conservatives to a far greater degree than liberals.This doesn t mean every conservative is less likely to open their minds to information which challenges their world view than every liberal, it simply follows the overall trend.It is a major obstacle in the way of liberals seeking to change the minds of conservatives, as whichever way they appeal   it is rejected. If liberals appeal in terms of reason and evidence   their case is rejected the moment it creates cognitive dissonance. However, if liberals move into more emotive arguments, these are often rejected on the basis of confirming to  naive idealism  stereotypes by conservatives. So liberals are painted as either policy wonks with no humanity, or airy fairy liberals with no common sense.Meanwhile, the most ridiculous arguments put forward within the normalised conservative worldview go unchallenged, requiring minimal or no evidence, such as Mexico paying for Trump s border wall for example. Mexico has stated on the record this will not happen, and yet it remains fact among Trump supporters. There is little doubt that if the Fox poll had shown Donald Trump or Ted Cruz beating Sanders and Clinton in a head-to-head   O Reilly would have considered it water tight.This is something for us to all watch in our own behavior. Do we demand the same level of evidence for arguments that conform to our world view, as those which do not? If the answer is no, then we are no better. If we want a cleaner, better politics   it starts with us.

13502,BRUTALLY HONEST BILLBOARD Turns Heads In State With Exploding Muslim Immigrant Population,"American citizens should be more concerned about the Left and the leftist media s attempt to HIDE the brutal truth about Sharia in America, than a billboard that gives readers an opportunity to learn the truth.In a state that doesn t tolerate any discussion of what the massive influx of Somali refugees has done to their neighborhoods and schools, this billboard will likely be a hot topic in Minnesota. Recently, the Minnesota Governor told his constituents to  Leave the state  if they don t like the massive influx off Muslims. Watch the INCREDIBLE VIDEO HERE. [Video]A billboard of a woman in a niqab went up on I-94 in Rogers at the beginning of June, prompting calls to the sign company from the public. Copy was added to the billboard in July, which now reads  Should America Fear Sharia? The billboard is sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C. based national security think tank. The site shouldamericafearsharia.org consists mostly of links to videos discussing different topics about Islam and Islamic extremism.The billboard was contracted out by the Center with Franklin Outdoor Advertising, a billboard company in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The billboard went up the beginning of June,  Franklin salesperson Chris Barta said,  Last Friday we switched it out and put up the one with the website. The website advertisement billboard will be up from July 1st through the end of the month when the advertisement contract expires.The Center for Security Policy s website contains articles and videos on national security threats of Islamic terrorism.In the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the Center s executive vice president Jim Hanson called the attack,  completely in keeping with totalitarian Islamic code called Shariah.

1966, Makers Of Fake Planned Parenthood Baby Parts Video Slapped With 15 Felony Charges,"Two anti-abortion activists are facing 15 felony charges after they secretly filmed themselves trying to buy aborted fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. (In case you missed it, these attempts were unsuccessful because, duh. But that didn t stop them from editing this video footage and then using it to claim that the women s health provider was selling baby parts. They weren t.)State Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt on Tuesday. The Associated Press reports:The allegations say the pair filmed 14 people without permission between October 2013 and July 2015 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and El Dorado counties. One felony count was filed for each person. The 15th was for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.According to Becerra, Daleiden and Merritt created a fictitious biomedical research company, which they then lied about in order to convince representatives of Planned Parenthood to meet with them   and then they secretly recorded them without their knowledge.Daleiden claims these charges are  bogus  and are only being brought against him because of Planned Parenthood s political cronies.  Naturally. The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,  Daleiden said. (For the record, the women s health care provider has committed zero crimes.)Last April, Daleiden claimed on social media that his home had been raided by agents from the California Department of Justice who confiscated all his video footage, among other things. There had been no word on the investigation since then until the charges were filed with the San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday.In January of 2016, Daleiden and Merritt were both indicted on similar charges by a grand jury in Texas. That grand jury had originally been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, but not only did they find no wrongdoing on the part of the women s health care provider, they also ended up indicting the filmmakers for their bogus video. Unfortunately, these charges were dropped because the prosecutor said the jury had overstepped since this was not why they were convened.Featured image via Eric Kayne/Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017",abortion felony tissue parenthood case video footage health provider baby state attorney press pair people permission dorado felony count person conspiracy privacy research company order parenthood knowledge parenthood parenthood business record health care provider media home department justice video footage word investigation court jury jury parenthood wrongdoing part health care provider video prosecutor jury image
1190, WATCH: Don Trump Jr. ADMITS On TV That His Father Lied About His Conversations With Comey,"Following James Comey s testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump claimed that he d never asked Comey for a loyalty pledge, claimed that he barely knew Comey, and claimed he never told Comey that he hoped the Flynn investigation would be dropped. Comey, for his part, testified that not only did Trump say he hoped he d drop the Flynn investigation, but also said he took it as a directive. Now Trump s son has confirmed Comey s version of events, making his own father out to be the liar we all know he is.That may well have been inadvertent, but it s what he did. It s amusing, really   the junior Trump first said,  We were vindicated!  and then launched into Comey: I think it s clear that everything that went on in the Comey testimony was basically ridiculous. They re saying,  Hey, he never asked me to stop a Russia investigation. Then he goes on to blasting Comey s report that Trump said:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  Junior Trump uses that to paint Comey as both weak and insubordinate as loudly as possible.

18174,"WATCH: CNN DOES SEGMENT From Bunker In Hawaii, Tells Viewers Hawaii’s Been Preparing For Nuclear Strike Since Trump Took Office…CNN’s Best Survival Tip: “FIND A CAVE”","CNN host Erin Burnett started out her segment on the threat of a nuclear attack by North Korea by explaining to her (very small) audience the danger Hawaii could face if nuclear North Korea, (the same nation Obama left ignored for 8 years), decided to strike Hawaii:  Guam of course, is not the only island within striking distance of North Korea. Another potential target within Kim Jong Un s range is Hawaii, which is where Sarah Sidner is live tonight. She s inside a bunker in Honolulu which houses the emergency center s state warning point.  Of course, there was no mention in Burnett s dramatic warning to her viewers of how Obama ignored the the very real nuclear threat that North Korea posed to the United States, or that President Trump was left to deal with a serious issue that President Bill Clinton bragged about handling while he was in office.Sidner went on to explain the very real threat that North Korea posed to the island of Hawaii and how Hawaiian officials there have been preparing for (here s the magic number)  at least seven months  (which, not surprisingly is about exactly the time that President Trump was inaugurated).Sidner then went on to explain that if a nuclear attack did take place on the island that not everyone would be affected. She explained to viewers in Hawaii, that if a nuclear missile was about to strike, they should get out of their cars and move to the inside of a building or their home, or find a cave.

534," Bannon Allies: Breitbart Return Imminent, Gear Up For War On Trump’s ‘Democrat White House’","Prior to being on Donald Trump s campaign, and later his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon ran Breitbart news. That particular internet news outlet is known for its promotion of racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, and other various forms of overt bigotry. They have also always been huge Trump supporters. However, that may be changing now that Bannon is out as Trump s White House Chief Strategist.According to journalist Gabriel Sherman, Breitbart is about to unleash to the full force of far-right media on the Trump Administration. Bannon could be set to return to Breitbart, where he will wage a full-on war on Trump s quote,  Democrat White House. Source close to Bannon confirms Bannon expected to return to Breitbart after a WH exit  Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) August 18, 2017Bannon friend says Breitbart ramping up for war against Trump. ""It's now a Democrat White House,"" source says.  Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) August 18, 2017Now, with his racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ views, Trump is far from being in line with the mainstream Democratic Party. The fact remains, though, that Trump himself was once a Democrat   and that is not ancient history. His own kids couldn t vote for him in the GOP primaries because they forgot to unregister as Democrats and re-register as Republicans. He has given money to top Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Further, two of Trump s most trusted confidantes, Ivanka and Jared, are huge supporters of traditional Democratic causes, such as LGBTQ rights, climate change action, and women s right to choose.So, we can expect a shift to the left if Trump listens to his daughter and son-in-law with Bannon gone, and therefore we can expect ripe fruit for infighting between right-wing media and the Trump White House. It really does seem as if the GOP made a Faustian deal with their proverbial devil, and they are losing. That s terrible for Trump but great for America.Pop your popcorn folks, and keep watching.

19238,STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS OUT! Connected To Benghazi Scandal And Clinton E-mail Scandal [Video],"The Washington Post reported that higher ups in the State Department jumped ship before Rex Tillerson could take the helm but we don t know that was the case. Were the people who left asked to vacate their post or did they jump ship? WaPo was even called out by CNN for the misleading headline.   One of the things that the main stream media doesn t mention is that these officials were knee deep in the Benghazi Scandal and one of those (see below for more on Patrick Kennedy) was knee deep in the Clinton e-mail scandal too! It s what the press doesn t tell you that s important. We just don t know if this is a matter of these people resigning or a matter of our new president recognizing that we need to DRAIN THE SWAMP! COULD THIS BE THE SMOKING GUN THAT TRUMP CALLED OUT ON PATRICK KENNEDY: In what one congressman called the  flashing red light of potential criminality,  FBI documents indicate a senior State Department official offered a  quid pro quo  to get the FBI to remove the  Secret  label from one of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s emails from the days when she was secretary of state.The documents say State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who had served as an aide and confidante to Clinton, offered the deal, and continued trying to influence the FBI s decision by taking his case over the head of FBI agents to whom he initially proposed the deal.FBI documents say Kennedy offered the FBI additional positions overseas if the  Secret  label, the middle level of classification, would be removed. Clinton, who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state, has contended she never sent or received classified information. The FBI has ruled otherwise.In response to the FBI bombshell, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump released a video on Twitter in which he said the allegations show  corruption at the highest level.

I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,  Clinton says in the footage on one side of a split-screen. 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information,  Comey says at screen-right.After Clinton says that she  thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two, Comey is seen rebutting her on Tuesday   declaring that she  used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on [her] personal domain. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Clinton  has spent the last 16 months looking into cameras deliberately lying to the American people.

Trump apparently lied when he swore to defend it during his inauguration ceremony.But Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been defending the Constitution her whole life and she has spent the last 24 years doing so from the Supreme Court bench.During an interview with the BBC, Ginsberg stood up to Trump without mentioning him by name and defended the free press while explaining why the American people need a free press. I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the truth,  she said, clearly rebuking Trump s claim that the media is lying about him.Then she pointed out that the free press was instrumental in busting the Watergate scandal wide open, which resulted in Nixon s resignation. Think of what the press has done in the United States,  Ginsberg said.  That story might never have come out if we didn t have the free press that we do. Indeed, if Trump had his way the press would act as his own propaganda machine. The press would only tell the American people what he wants them to tell them. America would be like Russia or North Korea, where the press is under the control of dictators.And that s why the free press should be defended more than ever against Trump and his authoritarian agenda.The American people need a free press that will hold Trump accountable, not one that serves as his cheerleading squad.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,"February 23, 2017",court history trump press name week trump media treason enemy people news media enemy enemy people trump tweet condemnation attack media news administration stream news media house mess process trump public break news media immigration trump assault press assault constitution trump inauguration ceremony constitution life court bench interview name press people press post york times day public truth trump claim media press scandal resignation think press story press trump way press propaganda machine press people russia press control press trump agenda people press trump squad image

397, Fox News Just Compared Slave Owners To 9/11 Victims. Seriously (VIDEO),"Nobody can accuse Fox News of being sane most of the time, particularly when it comes to some of their talk shows. Take Fox & Friends, for instance. Their hosts have extremely poor analytical skills and extreme conservative tunnel vision, but they press on with their bullshit anyway. Today is the 16th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, so Fox & Friends is talking about it. But they obviously can t do it without politicizing it, and they ve done so in an extremely disgusting way.They voiced their problems with the ongoing removal of Confederate statues from public spaces, and decided to try and appeal to people s emotions about them by complaining that, once liberals are done removing Confederate statues, they ll go after things like 9/11 memorial statues and monuments.No, really, they did that.Speaking to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who was talking about the memorial of United Flight 93 on the show, host Brian Kilmeade actually asked this question: Do you worry that 100 years from now someone is going to take that memorial down like they are trying remake our memorials today? Because the people who stopped terrorists from flying Flight 93 to its target are totally the same thing as people who advocated for the continued ownership of African-American. Of fellow human beings. The passengers on that plane died intentionally to prevent further tragedy. The Confederacy sought to preserve a tragedy that had already endured for thousands of years.Big difference, guys.And a horrifically insulting and inappropriate comparison to boot. Kilmeade might as well have tried to claim that the passengers of Flight 93 acted out of a desire to see the terrorists win. Zinke seemed uncomfortable with the question and tried to stumble his way out of it, and ultimately failed: I m one who believes, you know, that we should learn from history. And I think our monuments are a part of our country s history. Since we don t put up statues of Jesus, everyone is going to fall morally short. I think reflecting on our history, both good and bad, is a powerful statement and part of our DNA. I m an advocate, again, of learning from our monuments, understanding the period they were made. He ended with saying that, regardless of our differences, whether we re Republican or Democrat, monuments are a tribute to all of us.Oh, please. Just when we thought the entire administration had hit bottom, we find yet another freaking shovel with an order to start digging again. Zinke s complicit in this vile comparison now.

10718,BOOM! 4 VENUES CANCEL KATHY GRIFFIN Appearances After She Blames Trump For Her Career Ending Decision To Pose With His Severed Head,"Backlash against Kathy Griffin continues to grow with at least four venues announcing that they had canceled her performances after the comedian posed with a likeness of President Donald Trump s severed head.Venues in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have canceled shows. The Community Arts Theater in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, posted on its website that the show had been dropped  due to the recent controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff. Earlier this week, CNN said Griffin would no longer co-host its live New Year s Eve special from Times Square and another show was canceled at a New Mexico casino. An endorsement deal with Squatty Potty also ended.Sen. Al Franken has dis-invited Griffin from an event promoting his new book,  Giant of the Senate. Franken says he has heard from constituents  who were rightfully offended,  leading the Minnesota Democrat to change his mind from earlier, when he had said she was still welcome. He says he takes seriously that Minnesotans were upset by her behavior, which he characterizes as  inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere  in the national discourse.It s the latest fallout after the comedian posed with a likeness of President Donald Trump s severed head.Kathy Griffin s attorney says the comedian has been contacted by the Secret Service in the wake of her controversial photo shoot in which she posed with the likeness of President Donald Trump s severed head.Attorney Lisa Bloom says Griffin has retained a criminal attorney, who also appeared at a Friday press conference in which Griffin apologized again for the images. Griffin said she is the subject of a Secret Service investigation, but did not provide any further information about the inquiry or if she was cooperating.Griffin says she will not refrain from joking about Trump in the future.Since the comedian posed with a likeness of President Donald Trump s severed head, she has been fired from her annual gig hosting CNN s New Year s Eve special and several performances have been canceled at venues across the U.S.",politics,"Jun 2, 2017",backlash griffin comedian likeness president head york community theater show controversy griffin concern safety security staff week griffin year special times show casino deal potty griffin event book giant senate democrat mind behavior inappropriate something discourse comedian likeness president head griffin attorney comedian service wake photo shoot likeness president head attorney bloom griffin attorney press conference griffin griffin subject service investigation information inquiry griffin trump future comedian likeness president head gig year
16576,NATIONAL SALARY? This Crazy Country Ready To Vote For “Free Money” For Everyone,"Swiss voters are deciding whether they want to have a  national salary  for everyone. Everyone gets a paycheck no matter what! Of course, the economists are horrified by this:The argument doesn t sway many economists, who say the fear of poverty is largely what motivates a workforce. If you pay people to do nothing, they will do nothing Voters in Switzerland have been asked to decide whether to provide the entire population with a basic, unconditional income   an unprecedented idea. The issue is a contentious one calling into question the value of work.Polls opened on Sunday in which Swiss voters were being asked whether an  unconditional basic income  should be provided for every man, woman and child.The ballot doesn t give a figure but economists project a minimum of 2,500 Swiss francs ($2,560, 2,225 euros) per month is needed to make ends meet in the expensive Alpine country. Children would need about a quarter of that amount.The question was placed on the ballot after the necessary 100,000 petition signatures were gathered to force the issue.Opponents to the initiative warn a mass payout would explode public spending and the Swiss government advised voters cast their vote against the measure.But proponents insist the time has come for a minimum monthly wage as sweeping technological changes and advances in automation continue to displace manual workers. Our parents, grandparents and beyond worked hard so that we could produce more by working less, with machines and so forth,  Ralph Kundig, president of the Swiss chapter of the Basic Income Earth Network said.  The only thing that they did not foresee was that this wealth would only benefit the owners of the means of production. Revolutionary or wacky?That argument doesn t sway many economists, who say the fear of poverty is largely what motivates a workforce. If you pay people to do nothing, they will do nothing,  Charles Wyplosz, economics professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute, told the AFP news agency.Not so, argues Kundig, who says some pilot projects indicate most people wouldn t sit idle even if they could, and that entrepreneurship could be boosted if people weren t so afraid of the financial risk. Basic income is much more of a stimulant to employment and the economic activity of a country,  he said.Observers are watching with interest to see how the vote will go. International Labor Organization Director General Guy Ryder said he expected interest in the issue to swell, as technological advances make more and more jobs obsolete, and a growing number of people remain in the ranks of the working poor. We are going to have to find ways of distributing national income which are not directly related to the work that we do,  Ryder said.At this point it s all theoretical and it will be up to Swiss voters to decide.So who would pay for it?Different models have been posited, including fees on salaries of people who earn more than the minimum, savings from welfare programs that would be discontinued and taxes or spending cuts in the state budget.

10232,WHOA! NEW EMAILS SHOW COMEY FBI LIED About Meeting Between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch On Tarmac…Proves Media Colluded With Obama’s DOJ To Kill Story About Tarmac Meeting [VIDEO],"A new email dump from the FBI via a FOIA request by the ACLJ reveals what appears to be collusion between the media and the DOJ to squash the story about the 2016 meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac in Phoenix, AZ.Also Comey reportedly said the FBI had no documents related to this meeting to fill a prior FOIA request. That apparently isn t true, given this new email dump.  The Right ScoopWatch:From the ACLJ: We have just obtained hundreds of pages in our ongoing investigation and federal lawsuit on former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton while the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI had an ongoing criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. The results are shocking.Watch Lynch s explanation of her meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac:First, the Comey FBI lied to us. Last July, we sent FOIA requests to both the Comey FBI and the Lynch DOJ asking for any documents related to the Clinton Lynch plane meeting. The FBI, under the then directorship of James Comey, replied that  No records responsive to your request were located. The documents we received today from the Department of Justice include several emails from the FBI to DOJ officials concerning the meeting. One with the subject line  FLAG  was correspondence between FBI officials (Richard Quinn, FBI Media/Investigative Publicity, and Michael Kortan) and DOJ officials concerning  flag[ing] a story . . . about a casual, unscheduled meeting between former president Bill Clinton and the AG.  The DOJ official instructs the FBI to  let me know if you get any questions about this  and provides  [o]ur talkers [DOJ talking points] on this . The talking points, however are redacted.Another email to the FBI contains the subject line  security details coordinate between Loretta Lynch/Bill Clinton? On July 1, 2016   just days before our FOIA request   a DOJ email chain under the subject line,  FBI just called,  indicates that the  FBI . . . is looking for guidance  in responding to media inquiries about news reports that the FBI had prevented the press from taking pictures of the Clinton Lynch meeting. The discussion then went off email to several phone calls (of which we are not able to obtain records). An hour later, Carolyn Pokomy of the Office of the Attorney General stated,  I will let Rybicki know.  Jim Rybicki was the Chief of Staff and Senior Counselor to FBI Director Jim Comey. The information that was to be provided to Rybicki is redacted.Also of note several of the documents contain redactions that are requested  per FBI. It is clear that there were multiple records within the FBI responsive to our request and that discussions regarding the surreptitious meeting between then AG Lynch and the husband of the subject of an ongoing FBI criminal investigation reached the highest levels of the FBI.However, on October 21, 2016, the Comey FBI replied to our legal demands that  No records responsive to your request were located.  This is in direct contravention to the law, and we are preparing further legal action to force the FBI to come clean and turn over ALL documents related to this matter to us in a timely manner.Second, the hundreds of pages of (heavily redacted   more on that below) documents paint a clear picture of a DOJ in crisis mode as the news broke of Attorney General Lynch s meeting with former President Clinton. In fact, the records appear to indicate that the Attorney General s spin team immediately began preparing talking points for the Attorney General regarding the meeting BEFORE ever speaking with the AG about the matter.Third, there is clear evidence that the main stream media was colluding with the DOJ to bury the story. A Washington Post reporter, speaking of the Clinton Lynch meeting story, said,  I m hoping I can put it to rest .  The same Washington Post reporter, interacting with the DOJ spin team, implemented specific DOJ requests to change his story to make the Attorney General appear in a more favorable light. A New York Times reporter apologetically told the Obama DOJ that he was being  pressed into service  to have to cover the story. As the story was breaking, DOJ press officials stated,  I also talked to the ABC producer, who noted that they aren t interested, even if Fox runs with it. Two days after the meeting, DOJ officials in a chain of emails that includes emails to Attorney General Lynch herself stated that the media coverage of the meeting  looks like all or most are FOX  and that  CBS . . . just says a few lines about the meeting. Fourth, DOJ bureaucrats have redacted all the talking points, discussions of talking points, a statement on the meeting that was apparently never delivered because there was not enough media coverage on the meeting, and its substantive discussions with the FBI on the matter. They absurdly claim the  deliberative process exemption  to FOIA, which is only supposed to apply to agency rulemaking processes.The ACLJ won t stop until justice is served on this matter:Discussions about Attorney General Lynch s ethically questionable meeting with former President Clinton during her investigation into Hillary Clinton clearly has nothing to do with any rule making process. We will be taking these redactions back to federal court. The law is on our side. We will keep pressing on with our investigation of former Attorney General Lynch until we get to the bottom of this.To donate to the ACLJ and help to fund the important work they re doing, click HERE.Here s James Comey discussing the Lynch and Clinton meeting on the tarmac:Here is Loretta Lynch s testimony before Congress regarding her meeting with Bill Clinton:",politics,"Aug 4, 2017",dump request collusion media story meeting lynch bill tarmac phoenix meeting request dump investigation lawsuit attorney lynch tarmac meeting president bill department justice investigation watch lynch explanation meeting bill tarmac lynch plane directorship request today department justice meeting line flag correspondence media publicity flag story meeting president bill official line security lynch bill days chain line guidance media news press lynch discussion phone hour office attorney chief staff counselor director information responsive request meeting lynch husband subject investigation request contravention law action matter manner picture crisis mode news broke attorney lynch meeting president fact attorney spin team attorney meeting matter third evidence stream media story post reporter speaking lynch meeting story post reporter spin team story attorney appear light york times service story story press producer days meeting chain attorney lynch media coverage meeting meeting statement meeting media coverage meeting matter process exemption agency stop justice matter attorney lynch meeting president investigation nothing rule process court law side investigation attorney lynch bottom help work click lynch meeting tarmac testimony congress meeting bill
7366, Conservatives Freak Out After Seeing Obama In Front Of Che Guevara Mural (TWEETS),"President Barack Obama singlehandedly caused a collective right-wing freak out on Monday when he took a picture in front of a Cuban ministry building that just happened to have a Che Guevara mural.Obama has been in Cuba since Sunday, making the trip a truly historic three day visit because a sitting U.S. president hasn t visited the country in 88 years. During the trip, Obama is accompanied by his family and dozens of American politicians and business leaders who are aiding the President in a crucial initiative to build a bridge between the U.S. and Cuba   two countries that have had political differences for decades. This photograph (along with many others) was taken as Obama was taking part in a wreath laying ceremony with several other officials in Havana s Revolution Plaza.Obamas s cause was noble, but as soon as word got out about the photograph, conservative websites didn t hesitate to start bashing the President for posing in front of the image of the Cuban Marxist revolutionary leader. The Drudge Report was one of the first, throwing up the photo on their site and captioning it with  Mission Accomplished. Drudge ReportTownhall.com called the photo a  gem of a picture,  and The Washington Examiner said the image had created a  fresh wave of fury.  The outrage continued on social media, as conservatives on Twitter unleashed an avalanche of accusations and insults. One user called Obama  a disgrace  while another criticized the President for posing with Che Guevara s image but not going to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle s memorial service in 2013.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterConservatives have been slamming Obama ever since he stepped foot in Cuba yesterday, obviously because they are more in favor of hostile, divisive relations than the mutual understanding and respect that the President is trying to create. Both Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and former (failed) GOP candidate Marco Rubio have openly condemned Obama s visit. The Right s reaction to Obama s photograph and overall visit to Cuba is just more proof that they will oppose, and try to tear down Obama any chance they get   no matter how far-reaching their reactions are.

21479,DIRECTOR OF SOME OF MOST VIOLENT FILMS IN HOLLYWOOD JOINS CAMPAIGN FOR DESTRUCTION OF GUNS,"No hypocrisy here Director Martin Scorsese well known for violent films like Goodfellas, The Departed, and Casino has joined a campaign for the destruction of guns.Scorsese will take part in Carl McCrow s  Gun Neutral Campaign,  which asks that a real gun be destroyed for every fake gun that is used in a Hollywood production.In December 2014 Breitbart News reported that McCrow was a part of a London-based gun control group called One Less Gun. At that time they were asking for donations to cover the destruction of a firearm and the donor was told he or she would receive a thank you note in the form of a bullet casing with the serial number of the weapon destroyed etched upon it.One Less Gun said:Like it or not, guns are a part of popular culture. They are integral to many of our favorite games and films [and] are in all likelihood to remain so for many generations to comes. One Less Gun is simply dedicated to reducing their number and promoting a social responsibility to this fact. One Less Gun offers everybody the opportunity to contribute to the solution of this largely ignored problem. By texting onelessgun to 70007 on your mobile phone you can destroy a gun for  5. Our target is to destroy one million weapons. That will save lives, stabilize communities and make a safer world.That campaign has now been complimented by the Gun Neutral Campaign and Scorsese is on board. For every fake gun used in one of his violent films a real gun that a law-abiding citizen could use for self-defense will be destroyed. According to The Guardian, McCrow responded to Scorsese s pledge by saying,  I m really pleased. If we can set this as a standard, then who knows how many lives could be saved. The simple fact is that there are too many guns and they ruin people s lives every day. By joining the gun control push after making untold millions of dollars creating films riddled with violence, murder, depictions of criminal gun use, and mayhem, Scorsese comes across much like gun-toting action star Liam Neeson. It was Neeson who emerged after the January 7 terror attacks on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in France to say,  There are too many [bleeping] guns out there, especially in America.

2443, Rick Santorum On CNN Addresses Anti-Semitism Under Trump: It’s Obama’s Fault (VIDEO),"On the same day that bomb threats were made, more than 100 headstones were damaged or toppled in a historic Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo., on Monday, in an attack reportedly carried out by an organized group. Ten Jewish community centers in at least five states in the U.S. were targeted with bomb threats on Monday. The wave of bomb threats totals 69 incidents targeting 54 JCCs in 27 states. All of this happened since Donald Trump took office. Trump has a huge neo-Nazi following, after literally being supported by every white supremacist group across the board during his campaign.But, according to what CNN contributor Rick Santorum said on Tuesday, it s former President Barack Obama s fault. CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Santorum on Tuesday why the alleged president hasn t called out the attacks on Jewish centers. While Santorum did say that Trump should tweet something about the attacks, he still defended the amateur president s silence. Let s look at the president s record and compare it with what we ve seen in the last eight years,  Santorum said.  Number one, the president has stood by Israel in ways that President Obama has not, and stood very solidly with the state of Israel. I ve got to tell you, Chris, this is why you hear about fake news,  Santorum said.  For eight years   eight years!   the Obama administration sat by and said nothing about the increasing anti-Semitism on college campuses! It s an outrage you guys are pointing to this 30 days in, and for eight years you ignored that story!  he added.In Trump s Holocaust remembrance statement last month, Trump did not even mention Jewish people. Former Clinton campaign surrogate Christine Quinn reminded Santorum of that. This is a case of bomb threats!  Quinn said.  Violence and desecrating cemeteries! I don t understand the school of thought. If you think President Obama didn t do enough then do more. This isn t about being compared to your predecessor, it s about defining yourself. And does President Trump want to be defined as someone who fights hate crimes and supports Jewish people? Santorum insisted on defending Trump by saying the former reality TV show star is  much more supportive of the state of Israel than Obama. Donald Trump s base is more pro-Israel, more pro-Jewish people than anybody,  Santorum continued.  If you talk to anybody in the pro-Israel movement, they will tell you the bedrock of that is the evangelical Christian community in this country. In fact, the folks who have been walking away are liberal Jews, who are walking away from Israel, not conservative Christians. Watch: Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton tagged Trump s @POTUS account and condemned the attacks.JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017Santorum needs to be reminded that Barack Obama is no longer the President. #ThanksObama!Featured image via screen capture.

8025, Americans Tell Senate GOP To Let President Obama Pick Supreme Court Nominee (IMAGE),"Sorry, Republicans. The American people have spoken and you lose.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans have insisted that President Obama should let whoever wins the 2016 presidential election nominate the new Supreme Court Justice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even vowed not to even consider anyone Obama picks, which is a complete betrayal of the Constitution and everything Scalia stood for.And the American people overwhelmingly disagree with the GOP.Not only is President Obama serving out the final year of the second term a majority of Americans elected him to serve, a new poll shows that Americans still want him to the job despite what Republicans want.A new Rasmussen poll indicates that Americans not only think President Obama should make the pick, they say Senate Republicans should NOT block any nomination Obama puts forth.All told, 51 percent of Americans say President Obama is still the commander-in-chief, therefore he should get to replace Scalia, while only 43 percent say he shouldn t. An even bigger percentage of people, 53 percent, say Senate Republicans should not stand in his way. Only 35 percent say Senate Republicans should remain the obstructionist assholes they are.Here s a chart showing the poll results via ThinkProgress.The poll represents the opinions of likely voters, which means Republicans should probably reconsider their stance since any political stunt could hurt them on Election Day. People are sick and tired of GOP obstructionism and blocking President Obama from filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court out of some sick political game won t impress voters at all.But rather than listen to the American people, Republicans will probably ignore them like they did when they listened to Ted Cruz and shut down the government. If Republicans really care about not getting their asses totally handed to them at the voting booth this November, they need to suck it up, respect that President Obama is still their president, and give any nominee he puts forward a fair confirmation hearing.

16026,BOOM! HARVARD LAW DEMOCRAT ALAN DERSHOWITZ Destroys The Left’s “Unconstitutional” Argument Against Donald Trump Jr. [Video],"Democrat Alan Dershowitz dismissed a major argument Democrats have been making against Donald Trump Jr., and said it s clearly  unconstitutional . This brilliant Harvard Law professor is a Democrat who is FED UP with the left s constant Russia mantra! He knows there s nothing there and tells Judge Jeanine:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjqxLE6thZIDemocrats have been arguing that laws stop campaigns from receiving anything of  value  from foreign entities, and have said  that items of  value  can also be information.That s their reasoning for why they think Trump s campaign violated election laws when Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who said she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.Not so fast! Harvard Law s Alan Dershowitz told Judge Jeanine that campaign finance laws have never been prosecuted that way and that using the law to prosecute people who obtain information from non-U.S. sources would violate the First Amendment: Under the campaign finance laws, I mean, there is a claim that if you get something of value, and they re alleging that information  from a foreign national could be, you know, stretched out to mean, you know, words. Judge Jeanine asked  Is that something that s ever been prosecuted? Dershowitz replied:  Of course not, and if it were to be prosecuted, the First Amendment would trump. A candidate has a right to get information from whatever source the information comes. Dershowitz then made the key point that just as newspapers are free to print any information they obtain from others, even when the source obtains it illegally, candidates for office have the same right to get information anywhere they want.He also stressed again there is no legal precedent to treat information as money under U.S. campaign finance laws: You can t include information under the campaign finance law. That would be unconstitutional. These are very key points that the press refuses to make clear for people   Have you heard this anywhere? Note that this is coming from a DEMOCRAT who was a Hillary Clinton supporter! Please pass on to anyone who  has been listening to the hysteria from the lefty media and even FOX News!

558, KKK Grand Wizard David Duke THANKS Trump For Championing White Supremacy At Unhinged Presser,"Donald Trump wants us to believe that he is not a sympathizer of neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, white supremacists and other assorted bigots. However, his statements on the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia prove otherwise. On Saturday, he blamed, quote,  many sides  for the violence, and equated counter protesters with the white supremacists. While he gave a scripted statement on Monday from a teleprompter condemning those groups on Monday by name, on Tuesday, there was a total reversal of those remarks.At a completely unhinged press conference, Trump blamed the so-called  Alt-Left  for the violence as well, even though any thinking person knows that there is no comparison or equivalency here between the Nazi filth and the people protesting against their hate. That matter not, though, as the white supremacists got Trump s message loud and clear. Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke promptly tweeted, thanking Trump for the so-called  truth  of these crazy remarks:Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa https://t.co/tTESdV4LP0  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 15, 2017Of course there will be massive backlash over this, and of course Trump will double down. Let s be clear here: Donald Trump is a racist and a white supremacist sympathizer. Further, the Republican Party is the party of white nationalists under Trump s leadership. They will never confront that truth, but it is fact. At this point, there is no arguing what they are.Trump is not a president for all Americans. He is the president for white nationalists.

8581, Chelsea Clinton BLASTS Charlotte Rampling’s ‘Anti White Racism’ Oscar Comments (TWEET),"Actress Charlotte Rampling really stepped in it when she declared that the boycott of the Oscars by black actors was nothing more than  anti-white racism.  Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the fact that, for the second year in a row, only white actors have gotten Oscar nominations is highly suspect. Rampling, however, said the following of the controversy: Maybe this time, no black actor or actress deserved to make it to the final selection. Why should we always categorize people? I think nowadays we are living in easily offended societies. There will always be someone who s too beautiful, too black or not white enough. Well, there s one person who spoke out against the remarks: Chelsea Clinton. She took to her twitter account and roundly condemned the remarks, calling them  outrageous, ignorant, and offensive. Outrageous, ignorant & offensive comments from Rampling. https://t.co/h7r1HNND5E  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2016The problem here is that Rampling and those who think like her have absolutely zero understanding of systemic racism and the way it works when it comes to seeping into literally every crevice of our society and lives. Rampling, like many people suffering from white privilege, is terrified that she ll lose her throne if there s more space for others.Chelsea Clinton, however, understands just what this boycott is, and why it is so important. It should not have taken public outcry and boycotts for the Academy to change its rules regarding voting for these awards. That is what it took, though,and in 2016, that s a damn shame.I am just eternally grateful to Chelsea Clinton for speaking out against the likes of Charlotte Rampling and others who would squash this very important conversation. Racism is alive and well, even in supposedly  liberal  Hollywood. It is time   far past time, in fact   that we realized that racism didn t end with the signing of the Civil Rights Act.Thank you, Chelsea Clinton, for saying what needed to be said here.Featured image via Chelsea Clinton Twitter",News,"January 23, 2016",actress boycott nothing racism anyone pair fact year row following controversy time actor actress selection people someone person twitter account ignorant problem understanding racism way crevice society people privilege throne space boycott outcry academy voting damn shame conversation racism time time fact racism end act image twitter
14001,WHOA! FORMER DEMOCRAT CONGRESSWOMAN Reveals Hillary’s Criminal Past [VIDEO],"Dr. Cynthia McKinney reveals Hillary s murderous past with Benghazi, and how the globalists will attempt to fuel race wars to further divide americans.Help us spread the word about the liberty movement, we re reaching millions help us reach millions more. Via: InfoWarsDr. Cynthia McKinney has made a career of speaking her mind and challenging authority. With her opinions, actions, and even her sense of style, McKinney has inspired both admiration and controversy.McKinney s political career began unofficially in 1986 when her father, Georgia State Representative Billy McKinney, put her name on the ballot as a write-in. Cynthia McKinney was living in Jamaica at the time and did not take the matter seriously; still, she garnered a large percentage of votes without even trying. Two years later, McKinney ran for and won the seat, creating the first father/daughter combination to serve together in the Georgia State House of Representatives. Cynthia immediately began making her own mark, defying House dress codes for women by wearing trousers instead of dresses. She spoke out against the first Persian Gulf War, and despite being in the House with her father, she often disagreed and voted against him.In 1992, McKinney won a seat in the US House of Representatives in Georgia s newly created 11th district. She was the first African-American woman to represent Georgia in the US Congress. Though a Democrat during President Clinton s tenure, McKinney voted against NAFTA, showing that she was not one to simply follow the Party line. McKinney worked hard in Washington to clean up pollution in her district and improve its rural roads.During her second term, McKinney earned distinctive committee assignments with the National Security Committee and the International Relations Committee s International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee. A supporter of a Palestinian State in Israel-occupied territory, she sparked controversy by criticizing American policy in the Middle East. After the 9/11 attacks, McKinney suggested the President might have had prior knowledge of 9/11. The criticism she received from this highly controversial idea probably contributed to her defeat in the 2002 election; however, she ran for the seat again and was re-elected in 2004.Between terms in office, McKinney traveled the country and Europe, speaking against the war in Iraq war and also about her 2002 defeat, which she attributed to Republicans being organized to  cross over  to vote against her in the Democratic primaries. Her career, including this episode of her defeat, was made into a documentary film titled American Blackout.Once back in office, she continued her criticism of the Bush administration on the first anniversary of the 9/11 Commission Report by gathering victims  families and intelligence experts together on panels to address the flaws in the report and critique its recommendations regarding foreign and domestic policy. In 2007, McKinney left the Democratic Party to become a Presidential Candidate for the Green Party.",politics,"May 2, 2016",race divide word movement millions millions career mind authority sense style admiration controversy career father state name ballot write time matter percentage ran seat father daughter combination state house mark house dress trousers gulf war house father seat house district woman democrat president tenure showing party line pollution district term committee security committee committee subcommittee supporter state controversy policy east president knowledge criticism idea defeat election seat office country speaking war war defeat career episode defeat film blackout office criticism administration anniversary commission report intelligence report policy party candidate party

She talked about someone who openly mocked a disabled reporter, so if you weren t somebody that openly mocked a disabled reporter, you wouldn t have your panties in a bunch,  she began.  Somebody had their panties in a bunch because he openly mocked a disabled reporter and it was captured on video. He panders to hate and that s what she talked about. Union went on to say that Streep did not attack Trump, but simply  shined a light  on his  terrible behavior. That s called being accountable for your actions. Indeed, Streep never mentioned Trump by name and merely called out his divisive and petty behavior. Yet, Trump accused Streep of attacking him and lied about mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski on Twitter.Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.

541, Former Business Partner Predicts Prison For Trump Once He Tells Authorities What He Knows,"Donald Trump is going to jail, and his former business partner knows it.The investigation into Trump s Russia scandal is ongoing, but it is getting closer to nailing him for collusion and other crimes.Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury to hear evidence, and that includes a former Trump business partner who is preparing to go prison over what he has to say.But he won t be alone in his cell. Because what Felix Sater says could land Trump in the bunk right next to him.Sater worked with Trump on many of his shady business dealings, including selling real estate to the Russians, one property being involved in a money-laundering scheme.Mueller s investigation into Trump s financial dealings has apparently dug up some really juicy stuff that proves Trump is a criminal who should be behind bars instead of the Oval Office.Trump tipped off investigators by warning Mueller to stay away from his family s finances. And he tipped them off even further by admitting that he may have sold condos to Russians. I mean, it s possible there s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows?  Trump said.Clearly, Trump has something to hide that he doesn t want federal investigators to see.During an interview with New York Magazine, Sater said that once he is done testifying and spilling his guts the media will have a lot to talk about. In about the next 30 to 35 days, I will be the most colorful character you have ever talked about,  Sater said.  Unfortunately, I can t talk about it now, before it happens. And believe me, it ain t anything as small as whether or not they re gonna call me to the Senate committee. And Sater also understands that what he has to say will probably send him to prison as well, which makes what he has to say all the more interesting because he is willing to go to jail in order to deliver damning testimony against Trump.According to Paul Wood of The Spectator, For several weeks there have been rumours that Sater is ready to rat again, agreeing to help Mueller.  He has told family and friends he knows he and POTUS are going to prison,  someone talking to Mueller s investigators informed me.The fact that Sater understands that what he says could put him in prison is significant. It means that he is willing to tell the truth about Trump even if it means losing his own freedom. Short of seeing Trump s tax returns, Sater may be the next best resource. If anybody knows the vile depths Trump has sunk to do business with the Russians, it s Sater.Trump has got to be panicking right now because it may not be long before he is arrested, prosecuted and locked away.If that happens, Trump would be the first president to be indicted and sentenced to jail. His disgracing of the office of the presidency would be complete and total. But at least justice would finally prevail and our nation can finally breathe a sigh of relief.Let s just hope that Mr. Sater is serious about doing the right thing.Featured image via Addicting Info Archive",News,"August 17, 2017",trump business partner investigation russia scandal collusion prosecutor jury evidence trump business partner prison cell trump bunk trump business estate property money investigation trump stuff trump office trump family something lot somebody russia trump trump something interview york magazine media lot days character talk anything committee prison order testimony trump wood spectator family someone fact prison truth trump freedom trump tax resource anybody trump business trump trump president office presidency justice nation sigh relief let hope thing image

7221," Wisconsin Newspaper SHREDS ‘Un-American’ Donald Trump, Declares Him Unfit For Presidency","A scathing editorial in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Tuesday laid waste to Donald Trump s presidential ambitions.Armed with a brutal headline declaring Trump unfit for the office  by any measure,  the paper began by repeatedly telling the Republican front-runner a word he hates to hear and called for Wisconsin voters to do something to stop him:No to Donald Trump.No to his bigotry.No to his contempt for women and minorities. No to his vague, clueless bluster about the problems facing the nation.No to Trumpism, which runs counter to the ideals of this nation of immigrants, to the notion that by working together under the rule of law, we can protect freedom and promote inclusion and fair play.Wisconsin Republicans: Reject this un-American candidate on April 5.Though it may be too little, too late, the editorial goes on to explain that Trump s anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim stance is divisive and has provided propaganda for ISIS to use as a recruitment tool.The Journal Sentinel also pointed out Trump s degradation of women, the violence displayed at his racist rallies, and his hatred of the the free press as facts that should have sunk his campaign already.The the paper dropped the hammer.Trump s crudity and spinning moral compass are merely the most obvious problems with his candidacy. His policy ideas, such as they can be divined, show a man with no political center who has given the hardest problems facing the nation no more than a passing glance. Any other Republican would be immolated by the hail of fire and brimstone called down upon Trump by movement conservatives over his apostasies,  the paper continued, noting how Trump is somehow bulletproof despite his economic and foreign policies that would light the world and America on fire as chaos reigns.Indeed, Trump s intention to immediately stop buying Saudi Arabian oil would weaken our longtime ally and make gas prices skyrocket here at home. Trump has also proven his ignorance when it comes to Iran and North Korea as explained by Andrea Mitchell on Meet The Press this past Sunday. Trump would also torpedo our economy by reneging on trade deals and instituting tariffs that would cost Americans millions of jobs. A Trump presidency would float down a river polluted by hyperbole and misstatement, tacking left to right, right to left, claiming up is down, white is black, night is day,  the paper declared.  A reality TV Wonderland. Only we live in the real world, where the words and choices of presidents can have momentous consequences   war and peace, feast or famine, freedom or tyranny, life or death. The paper concluded that Trump s presidential campaign is about himself, not the citizens or the country, and urged voters to reject Trump at the ballot in order to  end of all this reality television nonsense  and  do the nation a huge service.

19553,LEFTISTS CALL FOR Ivanka Trump Brand Boycott…This Huge Retailer Is Sticking With Her,"Unhinged leftists are calling for a boycott of Ivanka Trump s fashion line but Nordstrom is sticking with her. Now customers are calling for a boycott of Nordstrom because they refused to ditch Ivanka Trump s brand.PLEASE LET NORDSTROM KNOW HOW MUCH YOU APPRECIATE THEM NOT CAVING IN TO THE LEFT: NORDSTROM FEEDBACK Nordstrom s social media pages have been flooded with shoppers threatening to boycott the retailer if it does not stop selling the president-elect s daughter s shoe, clothing, and handbag lines.The comment below shows how misinformed the gay community is and how much the press has pushed their false narrative that Trump is anti-gay: When I worked for this company, you were not afraid to take a stand on supporting the rights of the LBGT community. It made me proud to be called one of your team,  one comment on Nordstrom s Facebook page reads.  I went home and bragged about it to all my family. Now I will no longer shop at your stores. By continuing to sell Ivanka Trump s brand you are making a stand. You are saying YES to sexism, racism and bigotry.   I will no longer be a customer with your company because you do business with the Trump family. A family that supports toxic, sexist, homophobic, racist rhetoric,  another post reads.  I thought your company had better standards, it is sad to see I was wrong.  The so-called Grab Your Wallet movement has called for a boycott of Donald Trump s business empire and other companies that sell Trump products. In the days following Trump s presidential election, supporters of the movement circulated a spreadsheet listing companies that sell Trump products, including Amazon, Bloomingdales, and Macy s.Calls to boycott Nordstrom have grown loud enough that Nordstrom s co-president, Pete Nordstrom, sent an email to the company Tuesday night clarifying that the retailer planned to continue to sell Ivanka Trump s fashion lines, Fortune reported. We strive to be agnostic about politics and to treat all our customers with respect,  Nordstrom wrote in the email.  Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results   if people don t buy it, we won t sell it.

Today EMILY s List, the nation s largest resource for women in politics, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Clinton is on track to become the first woman to win the Democratic nomination, and if elected, the first woman president of the United States. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president,  said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY s List.  With roots in the middle class, Hillary s top priority is changing the economic reality for American families. Her focus is on strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, and making sure hardworking families get a fair shot. No one will work harder than Hillary. She knows how to lead so Washington fights for all Americans. As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls (give them access to on demand abortions) and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career. The EMILY s List community   now more than three million members strong   is proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to fighting for women and families (supporting the killing of unborn babies).

She helped lead the fight for the Children s Health Insurance Program as first lady of the United States, and she put emphasis on women s rights as a  cornerstone of American foreign policy  as Secretary of State.A visionary leader who s always worked to create opportunity for others, Hillary has said she believes  our challenge is to be clear-eyed about the world as it is while never losing sight of the world as we want it to become.

However, the tweet really didn t gain much, if any, media coverage.But that has all changed.In light of FBI Director James Comey telling Congress that Trump has been under investigation for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election, Twitter users were quick to use Conway s tweet against her to point out how big of a hypocrite she is, demonstrating once again that Trump and his team really should watch what they say on social media because their words can come back to haunt them..@KellyannePolls well this tweet certainly hasn t aged well ???

6924, Sanders Campaign Begins To Raise Money For Down-Ticket Democratic Candidates,"After months of criticism from the Clinton campaign over down-ticket candidates, the Sanders campaign has begun to raise and distribute cash to Democratic candidates across the country.But there s a catch: the only candidates who are receiving funding are those that have publicly come out and supported him, a trio of new wave progressives including New York s Zephyr Teachout, Nevada s Lucy Flores, and Washington state s Pramila Jayapal. But there s another catch: all three candidates are currently waging primary battles against more  establishment  candidates.Sanders, who has run on an a vehemently anti-establishment platform, wrote in his email:  When we talk of political revolution, we also need people who aren t beholden to special interests,  before introducing Zephyr Teachout as an outsider who  literally wrote the book on political corruption. Teachout ran in the Democratic primary for Governor of New York, gaining 34 percent of the vote but ultimately losing to incumbent Andrew Cuomo.Lucy Flores was a member of the Nevada State Assembly for four years and ran for the position of Lieutenant Governor in 2014, losing to Republican Mark Hutchison. For the 2016 election, she will run to replace Republican Cresent Hardy in the 4th Congressional District.Pramila Jayapal is currently a member of the Washington Senate and will be running in Washington s 7th Congressional District to succeed retiring Democrat Jim McDermott.Sanders  website sent out fundraising emails which encourages donors to split their donations between the Vermont Senator and the trio of candidates.Democrats hit the Sanders campaign heavily for raising over $109 million for his campaign while giving almost no money to Democratic candidates, while the Clinton campaign dispersed more than $15 million in 2016 alone.The money that is collected for down-ticket candidates goes straight to a fund called the Victory Fund, and will be distributed to Democrats who win their primaries heading into the general election.Featured image via Kenneth Gabrielsen/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2016",criticism campaign ticket sanders campaign cash country catch trio wave york zephyr lucy flores state catch sanders establishment platform revolution people beholden zephyr outsider book corruption primary governor york percent vote lucy flores member state assembly ran position governor mark election hardy district member senate district sanders senator trio sanders campaign campaign money campaign money ticket fund victory fund election image
21674,BRUCE JENNER CASHING IN BIG TIME WITH NEW IDENTITY: “I’m the new ‘normal'” [VIDEO],"Timing is everything, and no one knows how to seize the moment better than members of the Kardashian family. The progressive left is determined to bully Americans into submission when it comes to accepting the LGBT lifestyle as mainstream. After spending years in the reality TV business, Bruce Jenner just happens to know a thing or two about marketing himself and has a chosen much kinder and more palatable approach. And now, in true Kardashian style, it s time to sit back and cash in and his contribution to the decay of our society big time.Watch new promo for Bruce s new show  I am Cait  here: How many people go through life and just waste their entire life because they never deal with themselves, with who they are?  Jenner says at the start of the 60-second spot. According to a press release, the eight-part, one-hour series I Am Cait will tell the story of Jenner as he lives his  new normal. Living for the first time as the person he feels he was born to be, the docuseries will also explore what Bruce s transition means for the people in his life and how those relationships are affected, while offering a better understanding of many of life s challenges,  E! said in the statement.The promo follows Jenner as he applies makeup in a mirror and drives  out into the world. It s so bright out there, look at that,  Jenner says from the backseat of a car.  Isn t it great that maybe someday you ll be normal? Just blend into society? You are normal,  a woman interjects. Put it this way: I m the new normal,  Jenner replies.Bruce Jenner, who appeared for the first time as a transgender woman on an infamous Vanity Fair magazine cover earlier this week, could parlay his transition into a half-billion dollar fortune within a decade, experts predict.Jenner s net worth is already estimated to be $100 million. But experts familiar with the earning potential of media figures told the New York Daily News that the former gold medal Olympian and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star could be worth as much as $500 million in the next five to ten years. She could become the wealthiest of them all,  VH1 s The Gossip Table host Rob Shuter told the paper, referring to the rest of the Kardashian family.  If Bruce Jenner made $100 million in 65 years, if all the stars align, she could be worth over $500 million in the next five to 10 years. Caitlyn is going to be a pioneer. Jenner is set to star in an eight-part, one-hour reality television series called I Am Cait, airing this summer on E! And he was already earning between $20,000-$40,000 in speaking fees prior to his transition, according to fee tracking website BigSpeak.com. But that figure could shoot up sharply in the wake of Jenner s transformation and subsequent magazine cover. A book deal could hit seven figures,  Brian Balthazar, editor of culture website Pop Goes the Week, told the Daily News.  Speeches could garner six figures each. There is no denying the transgender movement s recent ascendancy in the national culture. In addition to Jenner s record-breaking magazine cover and upcoming reality show, popular television shows like Amazon s Transparent have catapulted the issue to the forefront of American consciousness, and some companies are already jumping on the chance to get involved.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jun 4, 2015",timing everything one moment family left submission reality business thing approach style time cash contribution decay society time show people life life start spot press release part hour series story living time person transition people life understanding life statement mirror world car society woman way time woman vanity magazine cover week transition dollar fortune decade worth potential media york news gold medal star gossip table host rob paper rest family pioneer part hour reality television series airing summer speaking transition fee figure wake transformation magazine book deal editor culture pop week news movement ascendancy culture addition record magazine cover reality show television transparent issue forefront consciousness chance news
6783, Palin Stands With Disgraced ESPN Analyst Curt Schilling By Bashing Trans People In His Honor (IMAGE),"Like clockwork, the dregs of the conservative movement crawled out of their holes (and Twitchy comment sections) to stand with disgraced, now-former ESPN analyst Curt Schilling. His principal defender: Sarah Palin, a woman with enough hate in her heart to spread it around generously and with absolutely no job she could risk losing by doing so.The one-time baseball great had finally struck out with ESPN after posting (yet another) ugly hate-filled Facebook rant to his followers. Having been repeatedly warned by the network that his unabashed bigotry was out of line and needed to be curtailed if he wanted to continue to be a public figure, Schilling decided it would be a great time to begin bullying transgender people. On his page, he shared a conservative meme that depicts a man dressed as a woman with a caption reading: LET HIM IN! To the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow minded, judgmental, unloving, racist bigot who needs to die!!! After the initial blowback, Schilling created a blog post defending his belief that trans people are using public restrooms to prey on little girls (a  pants on fire  level lie) in a rant that had people seriously concerned for his mental well-being.You frauds out there ranting and screaming about my  opinions  (even if it isn t) and comments are screaming for  tolerance  and  acceptance  while you refuse to do and be either.YOU RE the ones making it the issue. I don t care, if you ask me about any of the topics it s likely (much to the chagrin of many) I ll answer with my opinion.Sarah Palin was appalled that Schilling had been canned from ESPN for his bigotry, so she decided to do something: Post an equally offensive meme bullying the trans community in  solidarity  with his. (Bonus points if you noticed the meme somehow managed to blame President Obama!)https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10154153457003588:0And thus we get a glimpse into the mindset of Sarah Palin. The  real  victim, in her view, is the hapless conservative who isn t allowed to spread vicious lies about a vulnerable group and still be allowed to have a job as the face of a major television network. To  support  her fellow conservative, Palin lashes out at the LGBT community   who, it should be noted, were not responsible for Schilling s pink slip.What s the word for this? Dangerous? Pathetic?

7443, Trump Forces Volunteers To Take This Creepy Unconstitutional Loyalty Pledge (IMAGES),"At this point in the election, Republican front runner Donald Trump has said enough stupid, offensive, hateful and dishonest things for us to form a highly negative opinion of not only the candidate, but his loyal supporters, staff and voters.Anyone who could wholeheartedly stand behind Trump   and there are unfortunately a lot of conservatives who can   is a threat to the future of the country. While that s pretty scary, there s something that might be even creepier: if one of Trump s minions wants to volunteer for Trump s campaign phone bank, they re required to sign a six-page binding contract that says they will never insult Trump (or his family members, businesses or campaign) for the rest of their lives! Should they use their constitutional rights to speak poorly against him, Trump will sue.Given how sensitive Trump is to insults nowadays (remember the fuss he made when former rival Marco Rubio insulted his hands?), it s not really shocking that Trump would make volunteers sign a loyalty oath. That, and the fact that Trump is absolutely egotistical and power-hungry.Last week, NBC reported that Trump was actually forcing campaign volunteers to sign contracts before they could begin helping him get elected after a strange email came to light. NBC said: In a Thursday email inviting supporters for phone-banking at Trump Tower, the campaign tells supporters to attend a briefing and then sign your NDA before volunteering begins. Here s a screenshot of that email:Via NBCA few days ago, The Daily Dot was able to obtain one of these free speech violating contracts. And yes, the contents are just as ludicrous as they sound: Promise and agree not to demean or disparage publicly the Company, Mr. Trump, any Trump Company, any Family Member, or any Family Member Company or any asset any of the foregoing own, or product or service any of the foregoing offer, in each case by or in any of the Restricted Means and Contexts and to prevent your employees from doing so. Part of Trump s contract, via Daily DotAlso in the contract are guidelines that volunteers are basically legally bound to Trump   they re prohibited to volunteer for any other presidential candidate, should they suddenly become sane and change their minds. There s no end date to these contracts, so Trump is pretty much making these people sign their lives away to him. Talk about making a deal with the devil The Daily Dot dug deeper and asked Davida Perry, an employment lawyer in New York City, if these contracts would actually be respected in court. Perry said that they wouldn t, and added: I guess [Trump] doesn t know about the First Amendment. This is really shocking. He s apparently so afraid that people would say something bad about him after spending some time on his campaign that they have to sign some sort of agreement. I don t see how this stands up. I don t see how a court enforces this. Well, Trump actually knows tons about free speech, but only acknowledges those rights when it will benefit him. Previously, Trump has threatened to sue the media for using their First Amendment rights to run unfavorable news against him.

This time the former reality TV star used images of Communist soldiers in a web ad advertising his support of veteran s issues.The men were clearly Communists, as the detail on their medals read  CCCP,  the Russian initials for USSR   The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Interesting choice for a photo of veterans in this @realDonaldTrump video: https://t.co/NdxdwpvMDD pic.twitter.com/PiagKGTP8H  Josh Perry (@MrJoshPerry) January 22, 2016After he was called out for posting the Communist soldiers as Americans, the Trump campaign pulled the video. But here it is.The incident is not the first time Team Trump has tried to pass off foreign soldiers as Americans. In July, Trump tweeted out a photo of himself embedded on the American flag with a photo of soldiers. The problem is, that photo was a picture of German Nazi soldiers. As in the photo of the Communist soldiers, a cursory glance at the picture would have revealed the SS eagle logo on the side of their uniforms.As he often has done during the campaign, Trump blamed the photo on a  young intern  and pulled the picture.It was the same excuse he used on Friday when he re-posted a complimentary Twitter image from an account called  White Genocide,  who turned out to be a Trump supporter who also is a backer of the white supremacist movement.Trump s campaign is a cult of personality, built of toadies who appear to have risen in the ranks based on how much they suck up to the former reality TV star. Actual competence doesn t seem to matter at all. Even more damning, it doesn t seem to matter to Republican voters, who appear quite fine with giving their support to Trump, even as he can t show the basic respect that is due to members of the U.S. armed services.But then again, that seems to be the mindset of most of the Republican establishment, so perhaps it shouldn t be so surprising or jarring.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 23, 2016",trump military campaign appeal time reality star web ad support men detail union choice photo video pic twitter josh communist trump campaign video incident time team trump trump photo flag photo problem photo picture photo communist glance picture eagle side campaign trump photo intern picture excuse twitter image account genocide supporter backer movement trump campaign cult personality reality star competence support respect establishment jarring image
2105, WATCH: Trump FUMES In Silence As Irish Prime Minister Shames Him In Front Of Reporters,"As he was standing next to podium, Donald Trump must have been throwing a silent temper tantrum as Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny humiliated him and his anti-immigrant policy.St. Patrick s Day may have been a complete bummer this year because of Trump, but during an event at the White House honoring the holiday, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny gave the world something to smile about as he delivered remarks about immigration that made Trump fume on the sidelines.Unable to rudely stop the Irish leader, Trump had to listen as Kenny talked about immigration and how immigrants came to America and made our country stronger despite bigots who looked down upon them. It s fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate St. Patrick and his legacy,  Kenny began.  He, too, of course, was an immigrant. And even though he is, of course, the patron saint of Ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also the symbol of   indeed, the patron of   immigrants. Here in America, in your great country, 35 million people claim Irish heritage,  Kenny continued as Trump scowled and squirmed.  And the Irish have contributed to the economic, social, political and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. Kenny then pointed out that Irish immigrants were also unwelcome in America as people blamed them for crime and lack of jobs just as Donald Trump and Republicans are blaming Latinos today. Ireland came to America because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, and even food itself, the Irish believed, and four decades before Lady Liberty lifted her lamp we were the retched refuse on the teeming shore. We believed in the shelter of America, in the compassion of America, in the opportunity of America. Here s the video via Twitter.

17968,"BRAVE Fiancé of Victim Asks BLM To Protest “In A Peaceful Way” After Accused St. Louis Cop Found NOT GUILTY In Death Of Man Fleeing From Cops…Leftist Agitators, Media Stir The Pot Anyhow, Increasing Tensions [VIDEO]","ST. LOUIS   Former St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty Friday of murdering a man while on duty.St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson s highly anticipated verdict found the white former St. Louis police officer not guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the December 2011 shooting death of a black drug suspect after a high-speed pursuit and crash.Activists, with support from some of the city s black clergy, had pledged disruptive protests ahead of Wilson s verdict.Wilson addressed such statements in his order:  A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street. They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.St. Louis Police reminded protesters that blocking traffic is illegal and is not protected by the First Amendment: Per Ord. 17.16.275, it is unlawful for a person to obstruct & impede the reasonable movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 15, 2017As the protests grew, Wells Fargo and Nestle Purina PetCare sent their nearly 7,000 employees home for the day.Police officers were seen preparing for potential riots:Bike cops are seen amassing in #DowntownSTL. #JasonStockley has been found NOT GUILTY   https://t.co/eLmJAKkagx pic.twitter.com/Kvd7aThPZe  KMOV (@KMOV) September 15, 2017Damone Smith, 52, an electrician headed to work, was among the motorists being rerouted from the protest area. I think the verdict is disgusting,  said Smith, who is black.  I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,  he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again   This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence.

The unconstitutional #JasonStockley verdict is further proof that LE & the court systems have been fully infiltrated by white supremacists  Tariq Nasheed (@tariqnasheed) September 15, 2017The Mayor of St. Louis used her opportunity to call for peaceful protests in her city to instead, stir the pot by suggesting that justice was not served, potentially leading angry protesters to believe it is now their responsibility to deliver justice:Mayor Lyda Krewson released a statement following the verdict saying,  I am appalled at what happened to Anthony Lamar Smith. I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences,  she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?  Bruntrager said.  It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that. And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.

852," Chuck Todd Goes Off On Trump, Says What Every American Is Thinking Right Now (VIDEO)","It s only been a few days since Donald Trump as been back from his second international tour, but America is already sick of him. Over the past week or so, Trump and his corrupt inner circle have been in the news nonstop for their unethical behavior revolving around Russia.If America is sick of reading about it, reporters must be sick of talking about it   and this was evident when Chuck Todd went off on Trump on Friday during MTP Daily. Todd did not hold back as unleashed an attack for several minutes, brutally mocking the Trump administration for the never-ending avalanche of bad news surrounding Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Blasting the White House for trying to hide parts of the story, Todd said: Their responses this week have proven to be incomplete at best and untrue at worst. Todd was referring to a breaking report by NBC news, in which an additional unknown person   former Soviet counterintelligence officer Ranit Akhmetshin, was found to also have been in attendance during the now infamous meeting with the Russian lawyer. To make his point even more powerful, Todd ran several clips from the past few days that blatantly showed White House officials lying and denying that they were hiding any information. It was a brilliant segment, and Todd perfectly showed America why Trump and his minions cannot be trusted. In conclusion, Todd said: Folks, this week has been a giant PR, political, and possibly legal disaster for this administration.

8433," What This Georgia Republican Just Said About The KKK, Slavery And ISIS Will Blow Your Mind","A state Republican in Georgia made an astonishingly racist set of remarks, in his defense of the South s Confederate and racist history.State Rep. Tommy Benton has flat-out denied that the Civil War had anything to do with slavery, compared the Confederate leaders to the Founding Fathers, expressed his profound displeasure with what he called  cultural cleansing  of Southern history. He insisted that the KKK was not a racist organization   but rather  a vigilante thing to help keep law and order,  claiming that made a lot of people  straighten up. Where do we even begin here? Let s start with the assertion that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. We can refer to the Cornerstone Speech, which was given by Vice President Alexander Stephens of the Confederacy, a few weeks before the Confederacy started the Civil War.Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.He suggested that the Civil War was wrong because the North didn t address the loss of what was approximately two billion dollars worth of  property  that belonged to the South. Yes, he meant that the slaves were the property of the South.Benton also is critical of African-Americans for not denouncing their own African ancestors for selling slaves.Then comes the idea of  cultural cleansing.  The offensiveness of this kind of assertion is profound. Cultural cleansing is another term for genocide, the latter of which didn t exist as a word until the Nazi s tried to cleanse Europe of people they considered to be  undesirables.  No, the removal of a Confederate flag is not equal to the gassing of the Jews in Nazi Germany.Benton expanded on the cleansing remarks by saying that the removal of things like the Confederate flag or renaming of things like streets or buildings which were named after Confederate legacy is directly equivalent to ISIS destroying cultural sites in the Middle East. That s no better than what ISIS is doing, destroying museums and monuments,  he said.  I feel very strongly about this. I think it has gone far enough. There is some idea out there that certain parts of history out there don t matter anymore and that s a bunch of bunk. No. Nobody in the South is ripping up roads or smashing buildings after executing the local population in order to  cleanse  Confederate history. We are simply asking that it not continue to be glorified as some kind of noble cause.Our founding fathers would have hated the guts of Republicans like this guy. The Founders embraced things like science. Being smart, to them, was an advantage   not a liability. The KKK was also not ever in its history a  justice movement  meant to keep the peace. Its purpose through history was to restore white supremacy and terrorize former slaves, immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and anybody promoting the civil rights of the groups that the Klan hated.Remember: Republicans keep saying that their party is the party of Civil Rights because Abraham Lincoln was one of them. I sure am glad they cleared that up. Otherwise, people like Tommy Benton would make me think the Republican party is full of racists.Watch local news coverage of an interview featuring Benton below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxj8O9sL_4Y&w=560&h=315]featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 30, 2016",state republican set defense confederate racist history state rep tommy war anything slavery confederate profound displeasure cleansing history racist organization thing law order lot people start assertion war nothing slavery cornerstone speech vice president confederacy confederacy war government cornerstone truth negro man subordination race condition war loss property yes property idea offensiveness kind assertion cleansing term genocide latter word people removal confederate flag gassing removal confederate flag streets confederate legacy east idea history matter bunch bunk nobody south population order history kind cause founding guy science advantage liability history justice movement meant peace purpose history supremacy anybody remember party party people party news coverage interview watch image video screen capture

So seeing as how the Golden Globes are put on every year by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, it s safe to say the Golden Globe Awards is not their favorite at all.And during his acceptance speech, Hugh Laurie absolutely torched Trump and the Republican Party. Thank you first to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for this amazing honor,  Lauire began.  I suppose it s made more amazing by the fact that I ll be able to say I won this at the last ever Golden Globes. I don t mean to be gloomy, it s just that it has the words Hollywood, Foreign and Press in the title. To some Republicans, even the word  association  is slightly sketchy I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere. Here s the video via YouTube:As previously mentioned, Meryl Streep and Viola Davis also delivered blistering messages to Trump. But so far, Trump has only thrown a temper tantrum over Streep s speech, calling her  overrated  and a  Hillary flunky  on Twitter. Seriously.Many conservatives are whining about the Golden Globes, claiming that it s inappropriate to deliver political speech at an awards show. But the First Amendment says otherwise.The Golden Globes is a platform that reaches millions of Americans so it s the perfect place to make a political stand that will be seen and heard.

2965, Michael Moore Says He Is ‘Absolutely’ Convinced Trump Will Ban Muslims,"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said there is no doubt in his mind that Donald Trump will go through with banning Muslims from the United States, just like he said he would.Speaking to Variety, Moore said that he has already done his grieving over Trump s win, which he saw coming long before it became a reality. I went through my five stages of grief months and months ago when I realized he was going to win,  he said.Moore said that he has  taken him literally and seriously since day one,  which is why he fully expects Trump to do all the horrible things he said he would on the campaign trail, like building a wall along our southern border to keep out all the rapey Mexicans. You do have to take Trump at his word,  Moore said.  I still hear people say,  Oh, he s not really going to build the wall.  Oh, he is going to build it. He knows that he s got to deliver at least a version of the wall. This, Moore explained, is why he  absolutely  believes Trump will go through with enacting his Muslim ban. He s shown how he s going to do it,  Moore said.  He s going to get away with it by making it a ban on Muslims who come from the following countries. He needs just enough cover for his crowd to say,  Oh, he s being reasonable there. He s not banning all Muslims. Moore also said that he was profoundly affected by Meryl Streep s powerful speech denouncing Trump at the Golden Globes. I had tears in my eyes,  Moore said.  It was so powerfully delivered by the perfect person. She was talking about human empathy. It was not about being a Republican or a Democrat. It was about: Have you no decency, sir? Trump s supporters like to say that they don t take what he says literally. But that is a mistake. As Maya Angelou said,  When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.

We could love this more Tennessee hits back at the loony state that banned all state travel to places that they think don t have the right policy in place. The response is epic: Whereas, California has passed legislation banning state sponsored travel to Tennessee and certain other states; andWhereas, the ban stems from legislation enacted by Tennessee that allows counselors to refer patients to other counselors who can better meet their goals, which the California State Legislature has judged to be morally reprehensible; andWhereas, California s attempt to influence public policy in our state is akin to Tennessee expressing its disapproval of California s exorbitant taxes, spiraling budget deficits, runaway social welfare programs, and rampant illegal immigration; andWhereas, Tennessee is pleasantly surprised that California will not be sending its economic development teams to Tennessee to recruit our businesses, but we can still send our teams to recruit their businesses; andWhereas, Tennessee is puzzled why California thinks it is a good idea to prohibit its state colleges and universities from participating in athletic competition in Tennessee (March Madness comes to Memphis this year via the South Regional), Kansas, Mississippi, and North Carolina; andWhereas, this type of ban, the result of legitimate disagreements about government policy, is neither persuasive nor productive for either party and will lead to economic warfare among states, as one sovereign entity attempts to tell an equally sovereign entity how to conduct its affairs by restricting travel thereto; andWhereas, the United States Constitution provides for a strong federal government for the common defense, but the Tenth Amendment grants the several states sovereignty in addressing issues solely within their jurisdiction, and all states should respect this most basic precept of American government; andWhereas, if states such as California persist in banning travel to Tennessee as a punitive action for this body conducting its constitutionally mandated duties as its members see fit, our state leaders should consider strong reciprocal action in banning state sponsored travel to those misguided states; now, therefore,BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED TENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we urge and encourage the Governor, the Speaker of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to ban state -sponsored and state funded travel within their respective jurisdictions to any state of the Union that has banned state   sponsored travel to Tennessee in a selective way, so that the other states feel the pain and not TennesseeBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge the other forty-eight states to refrain from imposing their unfounded moral judgment on their sister states as California has done in order to prevent escalating foolishness.Oh boy!

You will fire individuals in order to maintain that the salary requirement of the others that you have there. And others, of course, are putting   fast-food places are putting in robotics, and kiosks, so you can order your own food. This is what s going to happen. In fact, the Seattle minimum wage increase has not caused the sky to fall as Bruce and her Fox colleagues have been claiming since it was first passed. Many workers are bringing home more money to pay bills and take care of their families. Prices for products have not shot up as conservatives warned and it s still too early to tell if the wage increase is slowing job growth.Varney then turned to WWE has-been John Layfield, who makes a living being a loudmouth on television. Layfield spoke from the nation of Bermuda, and giddily explained that Bermuda does not have a minimum wage and that children work for tips.LAYFIELD: There actually isn t a minimum wage here, right now. You see some of these young kids   I run a program for at-risk kids   down, sacking groceries, about age 12, and they work off tips. So there isn t actually a minimum wage here.BRUCE: That s how it used to be.LAYFIELD: And it actually works fine. The problem I have with this $15 minimum wage is why 15, because it looks good on a bumper sticker? You re not talking about fixing anything. Tie it to inflation, or a basket of wages, so you take it out of politics and union hands. That s all it is.Except that it s really not working fine. As it turns out, there is a significant income gap in Bermuda and poverty affects many locals because unskilled workers from overseas are willing to work for very little which means great wealth for those who don t have to pay their workers very much because there is no minimum wage law. And children are forced to help out by working for nothing more than the hope of a decent tip.But Varney continnued to whine about the wage increases here in the states because people in poverty will now be able to bring in $30,000 a year. Panelist Elizabeth McDonald complained because she thinks anyone in an  entry-level job  should be in poverty, even if they have a family to support. She even claimed that college tuition will go up because young workers are making more.VARNEY: $15 an hour, for a forty hour week, is $30,000 a year. I mean, what  ELIZABETH MACDONALD: It s supposed to be an entry-level job, it s not supposed to be a career. And, by the way, AWOL in this debate   when you have things in the [Obama] administration like raising overtime pay depending on the skill set, and minimum wages, watch out college tuition goes up.VARNEY: That s right, because of all those people who work minimum wage in the colleges. You ve got that right.Of course, college prices were going up long before the minimum wage increase came into being. But don t tell that to Fox Business. The truth will hurt their feelings, if they have any.Here s the video via Media Matters.The bottom line is that increasing the minimum wage is not only fair it helps the economy in general.Every year, corporate fat cats receive salary increases of millions of dollars while the workers who make the business successful see their wages stagnate. This forces many workers to apply for federal aid to make ends meet. Raising the wage helps workers take care of their families and makes it unnecessary for a lot of them to apply for aid. It also helps boost the local economy because workers will use their increased earnings to buy goods, thus pumping more dollars into area businesses that will use those extra profits to pay their own workers a higher wage and hire extra workers if there is more demand.In other words, Fox hosts are fearmongering again and if they had their way, Americans would work for pennies and children would work for even less.Featured image via screen capture",News,"July 1, 2016",wage effect fox sh business host wage effect today panel days wage labor country panelist tammy cause march towards something people burden back people order requirement course food order food fact wage increase sky fox money care wage increase job growth living television nation wage wage program risk age wage problem minimum wage bumper sticker anything inflation basket wages politics union fine income gap poverty wealth wage law nothing hope tip wage people poverty year panelist anyone entry level job poverty family college tuition hour hour week year entry level job career way debate administration pay skill wages college tuition people wage right course college minimum wage increase tell business truth video media line minimum wage economy year fat millions business wages aid wage care lot aid economy earnings goods area wage demand way image capture
5582, Potential Trump VP Picks Running Away From Him In DROVES,"Donald Trump is having a very difficult time finding a vice presidential running mate, and it s not hard to see why. After all, the guy is political poison for anyone who wants a post-Trump political career. Two potential VP picks, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), have now withdrawn themselves from the short list of potential candidates for consideration for Trump s running mate.Of course, in her remarks, Ernst was in no way critical of Trump. She s clearly one of those party-before-country types who won t say a bad word against The Donald, but she also seems to want nothing to do with potentially being vice president under such a man. Ernst said: I made that very clear to him that I m focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is. I m just getting started here. I have a great partner with Chuck Grassley, we ve been able to accomplish a lot. And I think that President Trump will need some great assistance in the United States Senate and I can provide that. Like all good Republican toy soldiers lining up behind their bigoted standard-bearer, Ernst still wants there to be a President Trump, and says she will do what she can to make that happen. She said of the baffling decision to make sure the orange one is elected: I will probably participate more as an advocate. I would love to assist him out on the trail. Senator Corker was much less enthusiastic when announced his own withdrawal, only saying: There are people far more suited for being a candidate for vice president and I think I m far more suited for other types of things. There were no laudatory words about Trump, and nor was there any kind of promise to help Trump get elected. In other words, this guy is not going to be associated with Donald Trump in any way. And who can blame him? Trump s bigotry, praise of dictators, ignorance of the rule of law and any number of other repugnant things make him absolute political poison.Trump better stick to Christie and Gingrich. They re the only two who are dumb enough and/or have little enough to lose to attach themselves to a potential Trump administration.Featured image via Marc Piscotty/Getty Images",News,"July 6, 2016",trump time vice running mate guy poison anyone post career senator bob corker list consideration trump mate course way trump party country word nothing vice president man lot heart partner lot president trump assistance toy standard bearer president trump decision orange advocate trail senator corker withdrawal people candidate vice president trump kind promise guy trump way bigotry praise ignorance rule law number poison trump stick trump administration image marc

291," Trump Is Too Incompetent To Handle Disaster On An Island, But Obama Handled One Just Fine","Trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about Puerto Rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure, claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. He also said: This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff. Gee, these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated. With this administration,  It s really difficult, we re doing all we can,  is code for,  I don t really care about this at all unless I can find a way to make myself look good here. But are we really having problems because Puerto Rico is an island, making it different than Florida and Texas, which were also devastated by hurricanes? Current evidence suggests otherwise: Supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives, and too many blocked roads. One has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the Puerto Rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed. One person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms. That suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there. That would be a failure on our part, not Puerto Rico s.But then there s how Obama handled natural disasters on islands. In 2010, Haiti, which is practically next door to Puerto Rico in the Caribbean (not the Atlantic Ocean), suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake. Despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake (we had plenty of warning for Maria), President Obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war,  according to the Washington Post. Within two days, we had 8,000 troops on their way to the disaster-stricken country.In less than two weeks, we had 22,000 troops on the ground; 300 military helicopters dropping supplies, and 33 Navy ships aiding the relief effort. Eight days after Maria swept over Puerto Rico, we only had 4,400 troops working relief there, along with 1,000 members of the Coast Guard. Only 50 choppers were working to deliver supplies.The morning after Haiti s quake, Obama told the military that they were  going to respond in Port-au-Prince robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.  Rajiv Shah, who led USAID when the earthquake struck, said: We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory. The Posse Comitatus Act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory, and by contrast, Haiti is a foreign country. Our military response would be considerably different just because of that. But there were over 17,000 troops from 23 states on the ground in Florida after Irma. And the administration keeps saying that Puerto Rico isn t asking for very much, despite residents running out of food, drinkable water and other supplies, and San Juan s mayor breaking down over the Trump administration saying the response has been good.There are complicating factors, it s true. But this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the White House when responding to disasters, particularly those where people are dying. Obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2017",trump lot time island infrastructure reason relief effort response recovery effort something island water water water thing ocean stuff gee nobody administration way island evidence truck personnel government supply person personnel lot people ground failure part door ocean earthquake fact warning quake plenty maria president war post days way disaster country ground relief effort days maria relief coast guard morning military port prince government clarity shah earthquake country warning earthquake agency territory posse comitatus act military state territory contrast country response ground administration food water mayor administration response level ineptitude house people island lot factor relief administration image chip mark

17667,JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of “Faking”,"Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report. The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore  took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Corfman told the Post that Moore  touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying. This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,  Moore said.Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump s warning that Moore was less electable.Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election.   Washington ExaminerStephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of  faking  things like fake checks for instance According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be  fake news, after using mulitple  unnamed sources  in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.Ms. McCrummen s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19   False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.Ms. McCrummen s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states  criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.Sean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night.

6228, San Diego Padres Deliberately Humiliate Local Gay Men’s Chorus (VIDEO),"California is known as one of the most gay-friendly areas of the country, but they are not without their share of homophobes. This was made abundantly clear on Saturday during a home game being played by the San Diego Padres baseball team. The San Diego Gay Men s Chorus was due to perform the national anthem prior to the game s start, and things went horribly wrong.Perhaps there was already foreshadowing that the Gay Men s Chorus would not be welcome to do their performance, considering the fact that there were calls for them to pay for tickets for the so-called privilege of performing   even if they had no intentions of staying to watch the game. However, if you think that was bad, what happened during the performance itself was infinitely worse. As the chorus took the field to sing the Star Spangled Banner, to their horror, a recording of a woman s voice singing the song was played. Game officials made no move to stop the recording, and made no apology. The Gay Men s Chorus just had to stand on the field until the recording finished, and then they were taken off the field. When they were being led away, there were many homophobic taunts shouted, including one that chanted,  You sing like a girl.The San Diego Gay Men s Chorus released the following statement regarding this disgusting situation:What should have been a night of joy and celebration at Petco Park last night, instead turned into a nightmare raising serious questions about homophobia within the San Diego Padres organization and its relationship with the LGBT community.Before the start of the last night s San Diego Padres game, 100 volunteer singers of the San Diego Gay Men s Chorus took to the field to proudly sing the National Anthem. Instead, in front of the large crowd gathered for the LA Dodgers game, the San Diego Padres played the recorded voice of a woman singing the anthem.No attempt was made to stop the recording and start over. No announcement of apology was made to the singers or their friends and families in the stands. No attempt to correct the situation occurred other than to force the 100 men to stand in the spotlight of center field for the song s duration and then be escorted off the field to the heckles of baseball fans shouting homophobic taunts including  You sing like a girl. This incident followed several days of troubling comments and behavior within the San Diego Padres organization. Three days before the game, San Diego Padres representatives aggressively sought to prevent singers from performing the National Anthem unless they purchased a ticket to the game even if they did not plan to stay for the game which was not part of any previous discussion or written or verbal agreement and would have cost the small, community-based non-profit thousands of dollars. The demand eventually was rescinded on Friday following repeated complaints made by SDGMC and San Diego Pride to San Diego Padres management.With this as background, we call on the San Diego Padres and Major League Baseball to immediately launch a full and transparent investigation into the incident to determine if someone or some people intentionally engaged in anti-gay discrimination or a hate crime by playing a female s voice to represent a group of gay men with the purpose of denigrating and/or ridiculing gay men. The historic significance of such an act is not lost on the LGBT community especially in relation to professional sports and added to the depth of embarrassment experienced by the singers and their families.We also call upon the City of San Diego City Attorney s Office and the City of San Diego Human Relations Commission to independently investigate this incident to determine if members of the San Diego Padres organization engaged in activity in violation of the San Diego Human Rights Ordinance or engaged in any deliberate hate crimes based on sexual orientation.We applaud San Diego Padres President and Chief Executive Office Mike Dee for reaching out to our organization to apologize and to offer to meet with LGBT leaders to discuss the incident. We look forward to this meeting. We believe it is important to work together with the San Diego Padres organization to build bridges within the LGBT community rather than burn them down as happened last night.However, we are very disappointed with the San Diego Padres dismissively brief two sentence statement at 9:37 p.m. on Saturday, May 21, 2016 which did not appropriately address the gravity of the situation nor pay due to the 100 volunteers who took to the field in celebration and were led off in humiliation.Hopefully, Mike Dee gets rid of the people associated with and responsible for what happened at that baseball game. There is simply no excuse for what was done to these singers. This is blatant homophobia, and it was done in an effort to humiliate an organization of gay singers, to let them know in no uncertain terms that even in supposedly liberal California that they would not be accepted.Since fans were deprived of the opportunity to hear it on Saturday, here is a video of the San Diego Gay Men s Chorus singing the national anthem:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016",country share home game baseball team gay men chorus anthem game start gay men chorus performance fact privilege game performance chorus field star banner horror recording woman voice song game move recording apology gay men chorus field recording field girl gay men chorus statement situation night joy celebration park night nightmare organization relationship community start night game volunteer gay men chorus field anthem front crowd la game voice woman anthem attempt recording start announcement apology attempt situation men spotlight center field song duration field baseball girl incident days behavior organization days game anthem ticket game plan game part discussion agreement community profit demand pride management background league baseball investigation incident someone people discrimination hate crime voice group gay men purpose men significance act community relation sports depth embarrassment city city attorney office city commission incident organization activity violation ordinance hate orientation president executive office mike dee organization incident meeting organization community night sentence statement gravity situation field celebration humiliation dee people baseball game excuse effort organization gay opportunity video gay men chorus anthem image video screen capture

2700, Kellyanne Conway Says Trump Should Be Treated With The Respect He Deserves (AUDIO),"Whiny White House advisor Kellyanne Conway does not like how the media treats her illegitimate president, Donald Trump. She s continuing her crusade against the First Amendment. Interestingly, she, President Steve Bannon, and Trump, have treated the press very badly, yet they feel they should get favorable coverage anyway. Conway appeared on Sean Hannity s radio show, and talked about how mean the press is to Donald.Hannity asked Conway if the media at large was being  beyond disrespectful  to Trump and his staff, according to Mediaite. Conway agreed then said that the coverage was  inciting mob mentality if not mob violence. The coverage never changed [of Trump]. It never progressed, it never matured,  Conway said.Conway said she thought protesters had  a very low level of literacy  of the issues against which they demonstrated, when the truth is that her boss s grammar sits at just below a 6th grade level. It never took on the aura of respect that it deserved, and if you are not showing the President and his main spokespeople respect, then you re not showing the office respect, and you are inciting mob mentality if not mob violence,  she said.  You are encouraging people to go out there and unpeacefully protest and block airport entrances for people who are going to visit a sick parent and can t make their flight, or are going for a bereavement call and can t make their flight. Listen below:People are treating Donald with the respect he deserves. Protesters know exactly why they went to airports across the country. People were being unconstitutionally detained and handcuffed, even children. Conway said at the time that the whole idea that these people are being separated from their families is  temporary.  She called it an  inconvenience.  So, Kellyanne, just consider the treatment Trump is getting an  inconvenience,  and something that is  temporary  until his impeachment.She literally complained that the press is being mean to Donald to a Fox News host who treated former President Barack Obama like dirt for 8 years .

15120,WOW! BOMBSHELL BOOK Details History Of Hillary Beating Bill Clinton And Terrorizing Staff,"Poor Hillary she s clearly a victim of some right wing conspiracy. Everyone knows she s just a  concerned granny on a selfless mission to help the everyday American She s on a mission to be a softer, warmer, funnier candidate   but according to a new book, the real Hillary Clinton is so volatile and prone to violent outbursts that she terrorizes staff, Secret Service agents and even her own husband.In  The Clintons  War On Women  (Skyhorse), out Oct. 13, political strategist Roger Stone details Hillary s abusive behavior   dating back to the Clintons  days in Arkansas, where Bill served as governor. Hillary Clinton has a long history of being domestically violent with Bill,  Stone writes.  Hillary has beaten Bill, hit him with hard objects, scratched and clawed him, and made him bleed. Stone, a controversial figure who recently decamped from Donald Trump s campaign, also delves into the more fantastical rumors that have dogged the Clintons for years.Accounts of marital discord, however, have been well-reported for decades. Even Bill Clinton s former press officer Dee Dee Myers later admitted that she covered for the first lady.In March 1993, when Hillary flew to her father s deathbed in Little Rock, Ark., Bill entertained Barbra Streisand at the White House. When Hillary heard that the singer   an unabashed admirer of the president   had spent the night at the White House, she flew back home in a rage.The president was later seen with such a bad scratch on his neck that reporters were asking about it. I m the idiot who said he d cut himself shaving before I d seen him,  Myers told author Gail Sheehy in 1999.  Then I saw him   it was a big scratch, clearly not a shaving cut. Barbra Streisand was clearly around at the time. Arkansas state troopers assigned to then-Gov. Bill Clinton s detail had seen worse. Once, when Hillary awoke in the middle of the night to find Bill gone, she called the trooper assigned to Bill and demanded he bring the governor home immediately.She was waiting in the kitchen, and as Chris Andersen wrote in  American Evita: Hillary Clinton s Path to Power,  the ensuing fight got violent, with  shattering glass and slamming doors  reverberating throughout the mansion.  When it was over, staff members . . . [found] broken glass, smashed dishes and a cupboard door ripped off its hinges. Andersen also wrote that Hillary would assault Bill in their limo en route to official functions. Whatever was available, she d throw at Bill:  Yellow legal pads, files, briefing books, car keys . . .  They d be screaming at each other, real blue-in-the-face stuff,  one of their drivers said,  but when the car pulled up to their destination, it was all smiles and waving for the crowd. The Secret Service, Stone writes, got a glimpse of the domestic discord as early as Inauguration Day 1993, when Bill told her she couldn t take the vice president s office as her own. Hillary began Inauguration Day 1993 cursing and shrieking profanities at Bill,  Stone writes. This account was also documented in Gary Aldrich s book  Unlimited Access: An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House    as was her verbal abuse towards her Secret Service detail. Just stay the f k back   stay the f k away from me!  she d tell them.  Don t come within 10 yards of me, or else! Just f king do as I say, okay? Hillary, Aldrich writes, was incensed that a Secret Service agent refused to carry her luggage   not part of the job description. Such disdain was inculcated in first daughter Chelsea. As former Bloomberg News reporter Kate Andersen Bower wrote in her book,  The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House,  Chelsea could be as vicious and imperious as her mother. Chelsea was on the phone,  Bower writes, when a Secret Service agent walked in.  Oh, I ve got to go,  she told her friend.  The pigs are here. White House florist Ronn Payne recalled that agent turning  crimson. Ms. Clinton, I want to tell you something,  he said.  My job is to stand between you, your family, and a bullet. Do you understand? She replied,  Well, that s what my mother and father call you.  In 1999, at the height of the Lewinsky scandal, Hillary again assaulted the president.Stone cites Christopher Andersen s account:  Much of what transpired . . . was plainly audible to Secret Service and household staff members down the hall. In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the president   both hitting their mark . . . Hillary slapped him across the face   hard enough to leave a red mark that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left the room. You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,  Hillary shouted. As editor and author R. Emmett Tyrell has reported, the verbal and physical abuse has not relented since the Clintons left the White House:  Sources close to the Secret Service . . . report that dreadful altercations have erupted several times,  and usually involve  yelling, screaming, throwing of soft and hard objects, breakage of vases and glasses and just plain nastiness. The newer, fuzzier Hillary will be a hard sell with voters, Stone tells The Post.  There s only one Hillary Clinton: she s the Ice Queen,  he says.  That s the real Hillary.

5938, Pro – Clinton PAC Launches New Website Chronicling All Of Trump’s Lies,"Today, Donald Trump tried to walk back his recent comments regarding Judge Gonzalo Curiel at an evangelical summit by proclaiming no one in the United States should be treated differently based on race.As Republican (and Hispanic) commentator Ana Navarro said:  Too little. Too late. It doesn t take a genius to see Trump is of course lying. He, out of anyone, believes someone should be treated differently based on their race or skin color, and his comments regarding Muslims, Mexicans and  his  African-American  supporter  shows that.It remains to be seen how long it will take for the mainstream media to buy into his lies and the front he s now starting to put up. But Hillary Clinton and her allies are certainly doing their part to remind the American public not to buy into the hype. He s still a lying racist, and they can prove it.Compiling lists of Trump s biggest lies from the Washington Post s  Pinocchio  ratings and Politifact s  Truth-o-Meter,  pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record has launched a new website, TrumpLies.com, highlighting all of the Republican nominee s lies, rants, conspiracy theories, and his deranged, inflated ego .Talking to reporters, Correct the Record president Brad Woodhouse said: People think all politicians lie. Well, Donald Trump is of a completely different order and it helps draw the entire picture of him being a fraud and a con man. A look at Politifact s file on Donald Trump shows a staggering number: of the 154 statements that have been fact checked, 118 (76 percent) have been false. On average, more than three-fourths of things that come out of his vile mouth are outright lies, often packed with hyperbole, stretched statistics, and no forethought whatsoever. He thinks he can say whatever he wants with no consequences.The website not only calls out Trump for his blatant lies, but offers strategic factual analysis to show how his promises cannot be met nor kept. Example: it is impossible for Trump to eliminate $19 trillion of debt in eight years. Somehow his supporters think he can do it, but every possible avenue shows that it just can t happen. And his  big, beautiful wall  would actually cost way more than $8 billion.So not only does Trump Lies point out his fibbing mouth, it blows up his stupid, pie-in-the-sky  policy  ideas, too.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"June 10, 2016",today judge summit one race commentator ana genius trump course anyone someone race color supporter media front allies part public racist trump post truth meter super pac record nominee conspiracy deranged record president brad woodhouse people trump order picture fraud con man look file trump number fact percent average vile mouth hyperbole statistics forethought trump blatant analysis cannot example trump debt avenue beautiful wall way mouth pie sky policy image
7744, Pope Francis Delivers A Major Slap In The Face To Wealthy Donors And The GOP (VIDEO),"Pope Francis has delivered a strong message to corporate types who exploit people for profit and attempt to cleanse their souls by donating to the church, telling them: we don t want your blood money.During his general audience in Vatican City on Wednesday, in which he railed against the exploitation of working people by feckless employers, the Pope said: The people of God and the church don t need dirty money. They need hearts that are open to the mercy of God. It is far from the Pope s first intervention on the matter of unrestrained and crony Capitalism that has come to define (at least) the last thirty years of human history. Last Summer, the Pope referred to the global dominance of Capitalism s 1% as the  new colonialism in a speech in Bolivia   pointing to the removal of liberty, human rights and opportunity created by gross inequality and the resulting centralization of wealth and power. He continued: In this third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of genocide is taking place, and it must end. Throughout his time as Pontiff, Pope Francis has continued to exercise the message of New Testament Jesus. A personal show of compassion, and a determination to enable poor and vulnerable people to make the best possible lives for themselves, and the widest possible contribution to their communities.What is so interesting about this though, is that the political party that considers itself the party of God on earth, the Republican Party, asset there delivering the opposite message.Somewhere along the line, Young Republicans confused Atlas Shrugged with the Bible and it s radical right-wing author Ayn Rand for Jesus. Republicans don t worship Jesus, they worship Ayn Rand. Republicans don t preach the gospel, they preach The Fountainhead. Instead of restraining the power of big business to hold unique influence over public and personal life, the Republican party has devoted itself to the opposite.Things have come to such a head, that Republican leaders are now openly denouncing the Pope and his interpretation of the Bible, rather than taking instruction from his leadership and questioning their own. In doing so, they are by their own definition, committing the sin of Pride   and we all know what pride comes before.

2103, House Committee Uncovers DAMNING BOMBSHELL – Russia PAID Michael Flynn To Appear With Putin,"It s easy to think the whole brouhaha with Michael Flynn was over the moment he was forced from his post as Trump s national security adviser, but it s not. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been investigating Flynn and his connections with Russia, and they just found something incredibly damning.RT, a state-run news network in Russia, paid Flynn to attend a gala in Moscow with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, released records that include checks, invoices and emails showing that RT literally paid Flynn nearly $34,000 to attend the function.And not too long afterward, he was busy advising Trump and his campaign in a voluntary capacity. Not only was he paid a speaking fee at the gala, but his company, Leading Authorities, received $11,250 from that gala. All told, Flynn was paid $56,250 to appear with Putin and do work for two Russian firms, all while he was acting in an advisory capacity with Donald Trump.Some of that involved a Russian company, Kaspersky Lab, which is a subsidiary of a Russian company that specializes in  uncovering Western government spyware.  In other words, evidence shows that he worked for a company that works against not just the U.S., but also against all our NATO allies. Kaspersky Lab claims it has no ties to any government, but  is proud to collaborate with the authorities of many countries,  in fighting against cybercrimes.Cybercrimes like hacking the DNC to help tilt our election to Trump s favor, maybe? If this isn t corruption by a foreign power, then what is? Democrats on the House Oversight Committee now want an additional investigation into these payments because the come from companies based in Russia.We already know Flynn was acting as a foreign agent in Turkey while working for Trump s campaign, and that he failed to disclose that until just recently. But now we see he was working with Russia, too. It s high time we learned just how deep this goes. It s not likely that Flynn was a solo actor here. The entire Trump administration must be thoroughly investigated   we can t allow Flynn to serve as their scapegoat.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,"March 18, 2017",moment post trump security adviser house oversight government reform committee russia something state news network russia gala president rep democrat house committee function trump campaign capacity speaking fee gala company gala capacity company lab subsidiary company government evidence company allies lab government election corruption power house committee investigation come russia agent turkey trump campaign russia time actor trump administration scapegoat image
22940,Billionaire ‘Bilderberger’ David Rockefeller dead at 101," The Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power   political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.      Senator Barry Goldwater, from his book  With No Apologies 21st Century Wire says Controversial globalist and banker David Rockefeller has died at 101 years of age.Rockefeller has been described as a philanthropist and banker, yet much of his legacy will forever be tied to the creation of the well-known think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission and his central role on the steering committee for the secretive Bilderberg Group established in 1954.The Bilderberg Group has often been passed off as an insignificant gathering of corporate CEO s, barons of oil, government top brass and royalty   most mainstream outlets still continue to mask the group s influence on foreign policy and world finance   but thankfully their exploits have been slowly uncovered with each passing year, as the list of attendees seem to change and grow with each new conference location.For those who still doubt there s a hidden element directing global interests, one only needs to look into the high-powered pursuits of Bilderberg attendees that have been linked to creating a multi-national sovereignty override through many transnational corporations with world trade partnerships like the Transatlantic partnership (TTIP) and Transpacific partnership (TPP), which now excludes the US via an executive order from Donald Trump.The following passage is from the NY Times: He spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did,  The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002, citing the profitable deals Mr. Rockefeller had cut with  oil-rich dictators,   Soviet party bosses  and  Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution. There was also an immense sphere of influence held by various power-hungry groups such as The Trilateral Commission, brought to fruition in 1973 by David Rockefeller and perennial foreign policy advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Commission was also joined by fellow Bilderberg attendee and longtime policy advisor Henry Kissinger. Contrary to what most people think   the vast majority of The Trilateral Commission s members have been from countries outside of America.Rockefeller, like George Soros, is ultimately tied to globalism and vast social engineering programs.More from RT below  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Billionaire banker David Rockefeller dies aged 101RTRockefeller died in his sleep at home in Pocantico Hills, New York, on Monday morning as a result of congestive heart failure, according to a family spokesperson Fraser P. Seitel.The businessman, who had an estimated fortune of $3 billion, retired as head of Chase Manhattan in 1981 after a 35-year career.In the statement from the The Rockefeller Foundation confirming his death, Rockefeller was described as  one of the most influential figures in the history of American philanthropy and finance, considered by many to be  America s last great international business statesman .   Rockefeller, also known as  the banker s banker , according to the statement, is said to have donated almost $2 billion over his lifetime to various institutions including Rockefeller University, Harvard University and art museum.David was the youngest of six children born to John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller.Rockefeller graduated from Harvard in 1936 and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940. Appointed president of Chase Manhattan in 1961, he became chairman and CEO eight years later.RT continues here READ MORE ON SOCIAL ENGINEERING: 21st Century Wire Social Engineering FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"March 20, 2017",commission vehicle consolidation control government commission effort control power senator goldwater book century wire banker age philanthropist banker legacy creation well council commission role steering committee group group gathering oil government top brass royalty group influence policy world finance year list conference location element sovereignty world trade partnership partnership order passage times life club ruling class club matter york times oil party revolution immense sphere influence power commission fruition policy advisor commission policy advisor henry people majority commission engineering photo illustration billionaire banker sleep home york morning result heart failure family businessman fortune head year career statement foundation death history philanthropy finance business statesman banker banker statement lifetime university university art museum grandson oil founder doctorate economics university president chairman engineering century wire engineering subscribe member
11428,"WATCH: Wildly Popular, Outspoken Geert Wilders Is Being Called “The Dutch Trump”…Why His Plan To De-Islamize The Netherlands Is Resonating With Voters"," Make The Netherlands Great Again  is one of Geert Wilders campaign slogans. While Wilders may have many similarities to Donald Trump when it comes to being outspoken, the Dutch firebrand is much more outspoken about how the radical ideology of Islam has harmed Europe and specifically the Netherlands. He makes it very clear that  There are moderate Muslims, but there is no moderate Islam.  (Watch video at bottom of article to see his lengthy speech about Islam and how it affects European nations where Islamists have migrated).The French presidential election will take place in April and May. In September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be seeking a fourth term.All three elections will be critical for the future of the EU, as the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism threatens some of the key bedrocks of the European project.All eyes this week will be on the Freedom Party s Geert Wilders as he gets a chance to test his electoral popularity in an era of massive political upsets.The international media like to portray him as the Dutch Donald Trump. But beyond the big hair, the Twitter tirades and the brash personalities there are a number of key differences between the two.Only a 21-mile drive from the legalised prostitute booths and cannabis coffee shops of liberal bastion  Amsterdam, Almere is another world.It is a multicultural melting pot where nearly 40 per cent are immigrants.It is also the heartland of extremist Wilders  PVV, or Freedom Party, whose Nexit and anti-Islam rhetoric has propelled it to the top of opinion polls in a country where six per cent of the population is Muslim.Wilders   whose campaign  mottos include  Make the Netherlands great again    has won popularity by tempering his anti-Islam outbursts with traditional Dutch liberalism. He pointed out that immigrants are sometimes very hostile to homosexuals, Jews and women s rights. Wilders, who is progressive on gay and women s rights, has taken this message and radicalised it further. And that message resonates with people in Almere s bustling market.He is vowing to  de-Islamise  the Netherlands by shutting mosques and Islamic schools, banning the Koran and having  zero asylum seekers and no immigrants anymore from Islamic countries .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LyJz2P393oMuslims make up about 6 per cent of the Dutch population, mostly from Moroccan and Turkish backgrounds.While campaigning in February, Mr Wilders said,  there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe, mostly young people   and that should change . The first paragraph of his manifesto states:  Millions of Dutch citizens have simply had enough of the Islamisation of our country. Enough of mass immigration and asylum, terror, violence and insecurity. Mr Wilders could win the popular vote, but he is unlikely to be his country s next prime minister.He had led the polls since November, but a  poll of polls  two weeks out from the vote had him just behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Mr Wilders was on 15.7 per cent, Mr Rutte 16.3 per cent.The Dutch House of Representatives has 150 members who are elected in four-year terms. Like the Australian Senate, their lower house is elected by a system of proportional representation.This means the seats are split between an array of major and minor parties. The next prime minister will probably have to form a coalition with a range of parties.All major parties have ruled out striking a power-sharing agreement with Mr Wilders, even if he wins the popular vote. They consider his policies to be either too extreme or simply unconstitutional.This does not mean a high vote for Mr Wilders would be meaningless. If he does do well on Wednesday, it will put pressure on whoever wins to move closer to his agenda.-ABCWilders explains the difference between Muslims and Islamists and how the Islamists will destroy countries where they migrate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9pxfA_oOlo ",politics,"Mar 12, 2017",campaign trump firebrand ideology watch video bottom article speech election place chancellor term future eu rise nationalism project week freedom party chance popularity era media dutch trump hair twitter brash number drive prostitute coffee bastion world melting pot cent heartland party rhetoric top opinion country cent population campaign popularity anti dutch liberalism gay message message people market asylum watch cent population lot scum streets people paragraph manifesto millions dutch enough country enough mass immigration asylum terror violence insecurity vote country minister poll vote minister mark cent cent house year house system representation array minister coalition range power agreement vote vote pressure agenda difference watch

16372,NEW YORK TIMES Publishes Trump Tax Return From 20 Years Ago…TRUMP FIRES BACK!," In a lame effort to score political points for Hillary Clinton, the New York Times published a portion of Donald Trump s 1995 tax return. They re now promoting the idea that Trump  could have  not paid taxes for decades.  Could have  doesn t mean he did! Does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage? Isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it! I would question Trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes! The front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue, representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate Donald Trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.The anti-Trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of:  could have ,  might be ,  may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative. Journalistic  narratives  are rarely based on facts.The identified $916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.Actually, Donald Trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the New York Times reported when it sold the Boston Globe in 2013 for a net loss of $1.03 billion.The Times purchased the Boston Globe in  93 for $1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $70 million, a loss of $1.03 billion.

18218,REPUBLICANS DON’T NEED A SINGLE DEMOCRAT To Fund Trump’s Border Wall…So What’s The Holdup?,"Yesterday, Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted a video of himself on the Mexican border flying in a helicopter and traveling on horseback with US border agents. RT if you agree  It is time for The Wall. pic.twitter.com/s5MO8SG7SL  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) August 1, 2017It makes for great theater to see Republican Speaker Ryan pleading the case for a border wall, but how sincere are the GOP about building the border wall? Even after posting a video that appears to show Ryan s support for the wall, he still seems unsure of himself. It s almost as though he s testing the political winds when he asks Twitter users to retweet if they agree that we need to start building the wall. How committed is the (formerly?) anti-Trump Paul Ryan to building the border wall that would fulfill one of President Trump s most popular campaign promises to the American people? Does he have the what it takes to defy the wishes of corporate donors and the US Chamber of Commerce, and do the right thing for the national security and well-being of our nation?The Last Refuge- Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives, Republicans are in control of the Senate, a Republican President is in the White House, and somehow there s  negotiations  on how to fund the #1 campaign promise of President Donald Trump, the border wall.Here s the rub.Here s what pundits never discuss.The Republican party doesn t need a single Democrat to fund the border wall.A single spending bill could come from the House of Representatives that fully funds 100% of the border wall. The spending bill then goes to the senate, where again, it doesn t need a single Democrat vote because spending legislation is specifically what  reconciliation  was designed to facilitate. That House bill can pass the Senate with 51 votes and proceed directly to the President s desk for signature.So, ask yourself: why is this even a point of discussion?The honest answer, for those who are no longer suffering from Battered Conservative Syndrome, is that Republicans don t want to fund or build an actual physical barrier known as the Southern Border Wall.It really is that simple.If one didn t know better, they d almost think Speaker Ryan was attempting to emulate the man he clearly despised during the 2016 presidential campaign. Yesterday, Ryan tweeted:  Make America the best  once again?  Hmmm interesting choice of words Paul. Ryan wouldn t want anyone to think he was backing our President in his quest to  Make America Great Again! or as it gets closer to Ryan s bid for re-election, maybe he s starting to warm up to the very popular President Trump? It s time to bring jobs back home, cut taxes, and grow our economy. It s time to make America the best once again.

5233, Mike Pence Somehow Makes Trump’s Khan Family Disaster EVEN WORSE (TWEET),"Ever since Khizr and Ghazala Khan gave their powerful speech at Hillary Clinton s Democratic National Convention, Trump has been attacking them for calling him out on his anti-Muslim rhetoric.The Khans are the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who was killed while fighting for America   but that didn t stop Trump from insulting and disrespecting them. Trump not only criticized Mrs. Khan for not speaking during the speech (which was really because the grieving Gold Star mother was afraid she would burst into tears) and telling the Khans that he, too, had made so many sacrifices.TwitterSince these remarks, Trump has received backlash from both Democrats and Republicans who recognize how heartless and cowardly it is to attack the parents of a slain soldier. Hillary Clinton herself denounced Trump s criticism of Ghazala, calling Trump s attacks insulting the family of a fallen soldier   Captain Khan, an American Muslim who sacrificed his life to protect his unit and other soldiers as a taxi raced toward a base containing a bomb. If you didn t think the response from Trump could get any worse, you re severely underestimating him and his team. On Sunday night, Trump s running mate released a statement that first appeared to be a defense of the Khan family   until the true nature of his statement was revealed. Mike Pence, in a Facebook post, claimed that even though Trump s recent actions show that he does NOT care at all about the Kahns, Trump actually cares very much. Pence, whose own son is a Marine, wrote, Captain Khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror. Then of course, Pence goes on to blame President Barack Obama and Clinton for ISIS   and doubled down on Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the United States. Pence wrote: By suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism, rebuilding our military, defeating ISIS at its source and projecting strength on the global stage, we will reduce the likelihood that other American families will face the enduring heartbreak of the Khan family. What a way to honor a Gold Star family!

10709,ALARMING: NSA Refuses to Release Clinton-Lynch Tarmac Transcript with Lame Excuse,"If Clinton and Lynch just talked about grandkids then why is this such a top secret transcript? This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",politics,"Jun 3, 2017",lynch secret transcript bill lynch battle people government citizen researcher recording bill tape public security agency release security man tape orthodontist larry watch filing lawsuit behalf week worth recording conversation place bill lynch phoenix june watch freedom information act request march year meeting attorney lynch president bill june communication office attorney meeting attorney lynch president bill june communication office deputy attorney meeting attorney lynch president bill june meeting attorney lynch president bill day office general article league politics security agency release tape bill attorney lynch airplane talk justification security block release information president executive claim husband lynch conversation golf june lynch department justice investigation scandal read freedom outpost

However, there s a more obvious reason why the father of 5-month-old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting. [But], look, if somebody s got Paul Newman in  The Verdict,  I d jump,  he said.  But there aren t that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f g dollars. I don t need money. Back in June, Clooney confirmed that he and his business partners   nightlife businessman Rande Gerber and real estate mogul Mike Meldeman   sold their tequila company Casamigos for $1 billion.  Fox NewsBut are the Clooney twins and George s enormous net worth really the reason he s  taking a break  from acting or could it have more to do with the fact that middle-America has lost their appetite for actors who fund and use their positions to propagandize for leftist causes and politicians?George Clooney s  Suburbicon  that debuted over the Halloween weekend, notched one of the most dismal wide-release debuts in recent years.Despite debuting on more than 2,000 screens,  Suburbicon  managed just $2.8 million, making it one of Paramount Pictures  worst performing wide-releases ever and marking a new box-office low for Clooney as a director and star Matt Damon.Perhaps one of  Clooney s biggest problems is that Americans aren t willing to support the leftist actor, after that little prediction he made about Donald Trump s chances of winning the presidential election in 2016:The arrogant Clooney, who according to Page Six was accused by Vanessa Marquez, a former  ER  actress, who claims she was sexually and racially harassed daily on set   and George Clooney helped  blacklist  her from Hollywood when she complained.George Clooney is also going to have some trouble shaking his association with accused rapist and serial sexual assaulter Harvey Weinstein, who was at one time, a close personal friend of the actor.  say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely. He was quick to tell The Sunday Times that the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he s not ready to tackle that role.The Sunday Times   Clooney won t say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely. He was quick to tell them that the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he s not ready to tackle that role. So many people since Trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,  he explained.  I don t have political aspirations. He added,  I have always been involved in politics. My father ran for Congress. It s been in our family forever. But, mostly, I can help in ways I actually know very well, like messaging [voters].

6411, Bernie Sanders Sends A Loud And Clear Message On Why Trump Will NOT Be President (VIDEO),"Over the last few months, Donald Trump has been able to garner enough votes to make him the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency. Unfortunately, his message has been based on divisiveness, consistently attacking minorities as the cause of the country s woes. Not since the America when it was perfectly fine to discriminate against women has there been a candidate whose views on women have been so repulsive. Not since Jim Crow America, when it was perfectly fine to use the language of racism, has there been a candidate who has openly called for the oppression of minorities, specifically Muslims and Mexicans. It s taken a long time and America continues to be a work in progress, but there has been improvement and Americans continue to work hard to move the country in the right direction.Trump s America is not the America that we ve all worked so hard to better. His election would lead us to a regression rather than a progression for a better society. Thus, our values are inconsistent with that of this demagogue.Bernie Sanders reminds us of this fact in this touching video that lets Trump as well as the world know that the American people are a great people and it s our diversity that makes us so great. When we are inclusive as a nation, when we help each other rather than divide each other, we are great. Bernie s message is the message of hope and love and in the end, it will overpower the demagoguery and racism of Donald Trump.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmAimxt0GaU]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 12, 2016",trump nominee presidency message divisiveness cause country candidate crow language racism candidate oppression time work progress improvement country direction trump election regression progression society demagogue sanders fact video trump world people people diversity nation message message hope love end demagoguery racism trump watch video watch image video
19079,ACTOR JAMES WOODS SHARES Hair-Raising Video That Shows Real Reason President Trump Refuses To Share In Angela Merkel’s Horrific Legacy,"#MerkelLegacy pic.twitter.com/wBh5Cjj2IW  James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) February 24, 2017In August 2016, Angela Merkel defended her  open-borders  policy: Aug. 23, 2016   ANGELA Merkel has defended her open-door immigration policy claiming it was a  humanitarian duty  to let in almost two million migrants last year.However, the German Chancellor admitted some areas of her immigration stance could be improved following a U-turn in public opinion against refugees.This was sparked in part by the Cologne sex attack, carried out by migrant gangs on thousands of women, and a string of recent terror attacks where the attacker was an asylum seeker.Nearly a year on from when Germany s borders were opened, Mrs Merkel still defended the controversial decision but identified certain areas where change was needed.Faced with international criticism, she claimed the open-door policy was  necessary and right .On September 4, 2016 Angela Merkel s party CDU party was soundly defeated by the anti-migrant AfD party in the German state election. Merkel assumed some of the blame for her reckless immigration policy, but still defended  her position.On September 19, 2016, Merkel admitted for first time she may have blundered over the migration crisis in the wake of another bitter poll drubbing.The German Chancellor admitted she was  unprepared  for last year s one million strong migrant influx. If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared. So why are the mainstream media sources ignoring what is really happening to countries like Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Greece, France and the UK? Why are they not reporting the truth about the damage this invasion of refugees has done to their culture, to crime rates (specifically rape and sexual assaults) in their communities and to their welfare systems?Watch this eye-opening interview with filmmaker Ami Horowitz as he explains to FOX News  Tucker Carlson what he found when he traveled to  open-borders  Sweden to make a documentary on the effects of the invasion of refugees:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aVs2u-R1Mk",left-news,"Feb 26, 2017",pic twitter august policy door immigration policy duty year chancellor immigration stance turn opinion part sex attack string terror attacker asylum seeker year decision change criticism door policy party party anti migrant party state election blame immigration policy position time migration crisis wake poll chancellor year migrant influx time refugee crisis media truth damage invasion culture crime welfare eye interview ami news tucker documentary effects invasion watch

Marine Le Pen is the Donald Trump of France. Her views are aligned with conservatives who want a check on mass migration from third world hell holes.We consider Le Pen to be a hero and a voice for doing what is right for France. Vive Le Pen! If you don t think France is dying, just watch the videos below:Muslim men are flexing their muscles in France and using their own special  penal code  to enforce Sharia Law on French women. These women, who appear to be natives of France are actually finding themselves resigning themselves to the idea of changing the way they dress and wear make-up over fear of repercussions by the Muslim men in their communities. There are some brave women who are willing to fight back, but will that be enough to stop the complete takeover of France by the mass influx of Muslim men from countries who despise the West?This video is very scary and should be a warning to all Americans who think it s okay to import millions of Muslim men and women from countries who have no intention of assimilating in America:Paris has been invaded by African and Middle Eastern freeloaders..it s chaos and violence This is what happens with OPEN BORDERS!

15448,OBAMA’S RACE WAR: HATEFUL IMAGES EMERGE OF CLASH BETWEEN KKK AND BLACK PANTHERS IN SC…One Viral Photo Offers America Hope,"The fundamental transformation of America continues . But one photo emerges that defies Barack and Michelle Obama s hateful and divisive narrative.In the latest chapter of the outcry over the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina, an unexpected scene emerged from rallies involving the Ku Klux Klan and black supporters this weekend   a photo of a black police officer helping a white supremacist at the Capitol in Charleston.Members of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK were protesting the state s recent decision to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds. Black advocates held their own rally, and a clash among the two parties ensued.IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH HATE, ONE HOPEFUL PHOTO EMERGED: It didn t take long for the photograph   taken by Rob Godfrey, the deputy chief of staff for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley   to spread on the Internet. Not an uncommon example of humanity in SC: Leroy Smith helps white supremacist to shelter & water as heat bears down,  Godfrey wrote in posting the photo on Twitter.Officer Leroy Smith was helping the man find shade and water on a hot day in Charleston, when temperatures reached the upper 90s. About 2,000 people attended the rallies. He was assisting with crowd control on the stairs where the KKK was rallying,  spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said of Smith.As might be expected, the general public largely fell into one of two camps   applauding the photo, or questioning it. This kindness chokes me up. How do SC people find that well of caring in the midst of so much hatred?  one person replied in the photo s comment thread. Amazing! I couldn t find it in my heart and I am white,  another remarked. Just curious. Put this in reverse. Would that White Supremacist have done that for Officer Smith at a Black Panther rally?  countered one tweet. Being nice didn t save those 9 people [at the Charleston church shooting] though,  posted another.Thursday, Haley encouraged people to stay away from the KKK rally. The strength and grace the people of South Carolina have shown over the last three weeks have inspired our family, our neighbors and the entire world,  she wrote on her Facebook page.  Our family hopes the people of South Carolina will join us in staying away from the disruptive, hateful spectacle members of the Ku Klux Klan hope to create.

579, President Obama Says What Trump Cannot Say Following Murder In Charlottesville,"35 people have been treated for injuries and others have been pronounced dead, including two police officers, following the fascist protesters who besieged Charlottesville, Virginia while spewing racist and anti-gay rhetoric. The Trump supporters became violent, with one of them mowing down a 32-year-old woman who was crossing the street during one of the most jaw-dropping episodes of racism in decades. Donald Trump offered tweets, then finally a video clip to express his thoughts over the murder, but it was lacking in compassion. Trump cannot say the words: this was right-wing terrorism by his own supporters.Former President Barack Obama offered a few tweets to express his feelings in the aftermath of the event which took Charlottesville by storm.Obama, who hasn t tweeted in several weeks, used Nelson Mandella s words to respond to the violence the world witnessed today.

17732,LOL! ANTI-TRUMP ACTORS George Clooney and Matt Damon’s “Suburbicon” Movie TANKS: “One of Paramount Pictures’ worst performing wide-releases ever”,"In fly-over country, and pretty much anywhere in between the east and west coasts of America, people are sick and tired supporting the arrogant, condescending, anti-American, Trump hating,  liberal actors  and Hollywood is finally starting to feel the pain in their pocketbooks. George Clooney s  Suburbicon  notched one of the most dismal wide-release debuts in recent years on a sluggish pre-Halloween weekend where the horror sequel  Jigsaw  topped all releases despite an underperforming debut.Despite debuting on more than 2,000 screens,  Suburbicon  managed just $2.8 million, making it one of Paramount Pictures  worst performing wide-releases ever and marking a new box-office low for Clooney as a director and star Matt Damon. Obviously we are disappointed in these results which we don t feel are indicative of the quality and message of his original movie,  said Kyle Davies, president of distribution for Paramount. liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne MooreAre liberal activist actors Matt Damon, George Clooney and Julianne Moore so blinded by their hate for middle America, that they can t see the audience they re trying to appeal to, has lost their desire to support them and their sub-par movies?Before the election last year, Matt Damon expressed his anxiety over a possible Trump win:  It makes me nervous,  Damon said of the possibility that Trump would win the presidency (which he did via the Electoral College).  It s a binary choice . There s no way we can let this guy be the [president]. To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? That s dangerous. He s impulsive and rash, and doesn t seem to think deeply about too many things. Who can forget George Clooney s interview, where he laughed at the idea that Trump would win the election, saying  There s not gonna be a President Donald Trump. That s not gonna happen. Co-star Julianne Moore is no stranger to the Hollywood anti-Trump movement.  The outspoken gun-control advocate shared her thoughts with the Huffington Post on Trump s  nationalistic  rhetoric more specifically. It s a very interesting time,  she said.  I don t know that any society has moved forward by being exclusive and nationalistic and that s what I m seeing Donald Trump doing.

403, New Hampshire Cops Intent On Protecting Sadistic Racist White Teens Who Tried To Lynch A Biracial Boy,"It s 2017, and lynchings of black people still happen, just as they did during Jim Crow. Case in point- how an 8-year-old boy in New Hampshire nearly lost his life because of some racist white teens who hung him from a tree with a rope. Luckily, the child was able to remove the rope himself and make it home.The whole incident started when the victim, a Claremont, New Hampshire resident was playing outside. The teens in question allegedly hurled racist slurs at the child, who is biracial in a 96% white town, and threw rocks and sticks at him. Things escalated when they all stood on a picnic table and took turns putting the rope of a tire swing around their necks. Then, they took the child and, according to Lorrie Slattery, a grandmother of one of the kids present, took the child and said: The (teenagers) said,  Look at this,  supposedly putting the rope around their necks,  Slattery said.  One boy said to (her grandson),  Let s do this,  and then pushed him off the picnic table and hung him. He swung three times before he was able to get down, and wound up having to be flown to a hospital for life-saving treatment. What is most appalling is how little national media attention this is getting. Further, Claremont Police Chief Mark Chase wants to make sure these horrific little racists are  protected  due to their  mistakes.  He won t even say whether or not there will be criminal charges, and certainly is not releasing their names. In fact, the only reason this is getting any attention at all is because the boy s mother, Cassandra Merlin, posted the following images on social media:This is a story that needs to blow up nationwide until this child receives justice. These attempted murdering racists need to be thrown in jail for the foreseeable future and charged with a hate crime. I won t hold my breath on it, but spread it far and wide.

Well, he raised 200K for Obama: That should tell you all you need to know about this guy except one more HUGE thing:He s the judge who blocked the Planned Parenthood videos:A federal judge late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers. The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama. He was also a major donor to and bundler for President Obama s presidential campaign. He raised at least $200,000 for Obama and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him.

The decision will stay in place while the lawsuit moves through court.The Republican president s administration and two California governments that sued over the order disagreed about its scope.San Francisco and Santa Clara County argued that it threatened billions of dollars in federal funding.But an attorney for the Justice Department, Chad Readler, said at a recent court hearing that it applied to a limited set of grants.Some of Judge Orrick s comments are shocking:Judge Orrick said Trump s order  by its plain language, attempts to reach all federal grants, not merely the three mentioned at the hearing. The rest of the order is broader still, addressing all federal funding. And if there was doubt about the scope of the order, the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments. Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves. Note that once again activist judges use  public comments  just like they did in the prior block to an executive order.READ MORE: ABC7",politics,"Apr 26, 2017",judge president trump effort president tweet storm overreach activist judge effort president trump president job judge activist guy thing judge parenthood judge restraining order release meeting abortion injunction center progress group parenthood participation sale judge injunction order abortion federation position abortion supporter president donor president campaign scholar democrat twitter fact constitution judge judge trump administration order immigration district judge ruling lawsuit order decision place lawsuit court president administration order scope san attorney justice department court hearing set judge judge trump order plain language rest order doubt scope order president attorney general relationship immigration enforcement cannot jurisdiction immigration enforcement strategy president block order

The players are students and not employees unless you want to bust this whole thing wide open and tell the truth about how players might be compensated. It s really pretty shocking that the NLRB decided to shoot this down since they re 3-2 Dem. The National Labor Relations Board rejected a bid by football players at Northwestern University to form a union. In an unanimous decision released Monday, the board said it lacked jurisdiction in the matter. By statute the board does not have jurisdiction over state-run colleges and universities,  it said. The board is the main federal labor law enforcement agency. Its members are nominated by the president and it currently has a 3-2 Democratic majority.The announcement reverses a March 2014 decision by a board regional director, who ruled that the players were employees of the university, not students. Therefore, they had the right to form a union.While that ruling applied only to Northwestern athletes, it had major implications for college athletics generally, being the first time a student-athlete group has been granted collective bargaining rights. Other groups could have cited it as a precedent if they tried to unionize.Via: Washington Examiner",Government News,"Aug 17, 2015",money pit get college football thing truth labor board bid football university union decision board jurisdiction matter board jurisdiction state board labor law enforcement agency president majority announcement march decision board director university right union college athletics time student athlete group precedent examiner

7888, 9 Amazingly Racist And Bigoted Things Trump Supporters Actually Believe (VIDEO),"Many Americans have suspected that the rise of Donald Trump, who launched his campaign attacking Latinos and has gone on to demonize blacks, Muslims, women and even Catholics, is tied to bigoted beliefs among a segment of Republican voters.Despite the protests from some on the right and even the mainstream media claiming that Trump supporters are backing their man solely due to  economic insecurity,  some new polling data has begun to confirm that the movement behind Trump is simply a white supremacist movement.Mr. Trump s popularity with white, working-class voters who are more likely than other Republicans to believe that whites are a supreme race and who long for the Confederacy may make him unpopular among leaders in his party. But it s worth noting that he isn t persuading voters to hold these beliefs. The beliefs were there   and have been for some time.Mr. Trump has reinvigorated explicit appeals to ethnocentrism, and some voters are responding.Based on the results of those polls, here are nine of the amazingly racist things Trump supporters seriously believe:When Trump says  Make America Great Again,  it seems like many of his followers really mean  Make America White Again.

14051,MICHELLE OBAMA Rants About Mississippi’s ‘Religious Freedom’ Bill During Commencement Speech,"Our racist First lady made an impact on the graduates of Jackson State by turning her commencement speech into a political rant way to go Michelle! Everything is about the  shtruggle  with this radical ideologue. She s probably the worst person to pick for anything uplifting because in her eyes it s all about being a victim. Can t wait to see her leave the White House!In a rare entrance into a politically charged controversy, first lady Michelle Obama used a commencement speech Saturday at Jackson State University in Mississipppi to directly target the state s recently-passed  religious freedom  bill. We see it right here in Mississippi   just two weeks ago -  how swiftly progress can hurtle backward,  Obama said.  How easy it is to single out a small group and marginalize them because of who they are or who they love. Obama made the comment following an impassioned revival of the state and university s stained history with regard to civil rights. So we ve got to stand side by side with all our neighbors  - straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender; Muslim, Jew, Christian, Hindu immigrant, Native American   because the march for civil rights isn t just about African Americans, it s about all Americans,  she said.  It s about making things more just, more equal, more free for all our kids and grandkids. That s the story you all have the opportunity to write. That s what this historic university has prepared you to do.  The state has received growing criticism from human rights organizations and businesses over the controversial law, saying it restricts the rights of the LGBT community. In a press conference Friday in the United Kingdom, President Obama was asked about a recent travel advisory to British LGBT citizens cautioning them of the newly passed law, he said it  should be overturned. In her speech, the first lady also reflected on the heated political battles her husband has endured as president, and urged students not to fall into disarray over the  anger and vitriol  in the political environment. We pay endless attention to folks who are blocking action, blocking judges, blocking immigration, blocking a raise in the minimum wage. Just blocking,  Obama said.  We are consumed with the anger and vitriol that are bubbling up, with folks shouting at each other, using hateful and divisive language. Obama then revisited some of the vitriol directed towards her husband over his eight years as president, including the  birther  conspiracy theory widely promoted by GOP frontrunner Donald Trump just five years ago.

3698," Trump Team Says Elton John Is Performing At Inauguration, Elton John Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself","If Donald Trump thought he d be seeing Elton John sing his praises on Inauguration Day he was sorely mistaken.During an interview with BBC, Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer Elton John will be performing at Trump s inauguration on January 20th. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration,  Scaramucci said, adding that John s appearance  shows our commitment to gay rights. This will be the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay rights stance,  Scaramucci continued.There s just one problem. Apparently, Trump and his team failed to ask Elton John first.Because after hearing about this claim, Elton John told Trump to go f*ck himself.First a representative for John made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near Trump s inauguration.  Elton will not be performing at Trump s inauguration,  the rep said.Then John s publicist Fran Curtis rejected the claim more emphatically.  Incorrect. He will NOT be performing. Donald Trump may be a fan of Elton John, but the feeling is far from mutual. John supported Hillary Clinton for president and said of Trump just last month that,  We need a humanitarian in the White House, not a barbarian. Just because Donald Trump said on 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage is settled law, it doesn t mean that the LGBT community believes him. After all, Trump s running mate is Mike Pence, a man who is vehemently anti-gay. Plus, conservatives expect Trump to nominate anti-gay judges to the Supreme Court, which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy.So while Trump is claiming that he s pro-gay rights, his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the LGBT community to stand behind him. Because Elton John is not going to be used as a propaganda tool.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 23, 2016",trump inauguration day interview trump transition team member singer trump inauguration concert mall inauguration appearance commitment president history house gay stance problem team claim trump representative artist trump inauguration trump inauguration rep claim trump fan feeling president trump month house trump sex marriage law mean community mate pence man gay trump gay supreme court gay jeopardy trump gay community propaganda tool image

910, Hannity Throws A Complete Hissy Fit After Conservative Columnist Calls Him Unworthy Of Media Award,"After all of the conspiracy theories and lies Sean Hannity has peddled over the years, he definitely does NOT deserve an award.But the right-wing Media Research Center is rewarding Donald Trump s top propagandist with a William F. Buckley Jr. Award for Media Excellence anyway, and a New York Times columnist is having none of it.Bret Stephens is a conservative columnist for the Times, and he thoroughly ripped Hannity in a recent column pointing out exactly why he is unworthy of the award. If we have reached the point where rank-and-file conservatives see nothing amiss with giving Hannity an award named for Buckley, then surely there s a Milton Friedman Prize awaiting Steve Bannon for his insights on free trade,  Stephens wrote.  And maybe Sean Spicer can receive the Vaclav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent for his role in exposing  fake news.  The floor s the limit. Or, in Hannity s case, the crawl space beneath it. Stephens went on to point out that Buckley once expressed his disgust about Donald Trump, calling him a  demagogue  and a  narcissist.  He warned Americans to not fall into Trump s trap. But conservatives fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Hannity fell even harder for it, going so far as to lob softball questions at him and then defend him on a daily basis. Hannity even committed hypocrisy by defending Trump for doing all of the things he complained about President Obama doing. When Hannity peddles conspiracy theories about Seth Rich, the young Democratic National Committee staffer murdered in Washington last year, that s an echo of John Birch,  Stephens continued. And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less Orwellian, to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off. The award itself is trivial, but it s a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life, and what it is that they think. Well, that set Hannity off on a Twitter rage in which he whined and bragged about himself just like Trump does.For the first time in my life I partly agree with @BretStephensNYT I do not deserve the WFB award.

15384,ZIMBABWE’S CORRUPT GOVERNMENT SEEKS EXTRADITION OF AMERICAN LION HUNTER: Secret Memo Shows U.S. Was Aware Of $45-$60 Million Trophy Hunting Business,"So much outrage by so many corrupt people it s hard to keep track.  One thing we know for sure no matter where you are in the world, you know you can always count on American citizens to seek justice against anyone who would harm an animal. Ripping innocent human babies limbs off and harvesting their parts for profit not so much As usual, there is none more culpable of the recent event in Zimbabwe, which incidentally is and has been quite permitted by the local authorities as long as everyone s palms are appropriately greased, than the US government, which years ago was fully aware that Americans were killing lions in Hwange National Park, but that its concern was not with the dead animals   no matter how hard the administration tries to feign empathy for the beheaded lion here and now   but with Americans getting caught in the act.al.com  Zimbabwe intends to seek the extradition of an American dentist who killed a lion that was lured out of a national park and shot with a bow and a gun, and the process has already begun, a Cabinet minister said Friday. Unfortunately it was too late to apprehend the foreign poacher as he had already absconded to his country of origin,  Oppah Muchinguri, Zimbabwe s environment, water and climate minister, told a news conference.  We are appealing to the responsible authorities for his extradition to Zimbabwe so that he be made accountable. On Tuesday, American hunter Walter James Palmer issued a statement saying he relied on his guides to ensure the hunt was legal. Two Zimbabweans   a professional hunter and a farm owner   have been arrested in the lion killing that garnered worldwide condemnation. There has been an outcry,  Muchinguri said.  Almost 500,000 people are calling for his extradition and we need this support. We want him tried in Zimbabwe because he violated our laws. I have already consulted with the authorities within the police force who are responsible for arresting the criminal. We have certain processes we have to follow. Police should take the first step to approach the prosecutor general who will approach the Americans. The processes have already started. The Cabinet minister said both Palmer and professional hunter Theo Bronkhorst violated the Parks and Wildlife Act, which controls the use of bow and arrow hunting. He said Palmer, who reportedly paid $50,000 to hunt the lion, also violated the act through financing an illegal hunt. The landowner violated the act because he  allowed a hunt to be conducted without a quota and necessary permit,  Muchinguri said.Muchinguri accused Palmer of  a well-orchestrated agenda which would tarnish the image of Zimbabwe and further strain the relationship between Zimbabwe and the USA. Palmer is believed to have shot the lion with a bow on July 1 outside Hwange National Park, after it was lured onto private land with a carcass of an animal laid out on a car. Some 40 hours later, the wounded cat was tracked down and Palmer allegedly killed it with a gun.Palmer, 55, is a dentist in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington. In a note to his patients, he wrote:  I understand and respect that not everyone shares the same views on hunting,  adding that he would resume his dental practice  as soon as possible. Zimbabwe Hunters On US Elephant Ivory Ban: As professional hunter Cliff Walker sets out before dawn in Zimbabwe s Zambezi River valley to find a lion for his U.S. client, he has elephants on his mind.Walker, 37, says a U.S. ban on ivory imports from Zimbabwe and Tanzania in February may cost him tens of thousands of dollars. While Gavin Shire, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife Services, said last month that the ban was  temporary,  Walker thinks it will dissuade clients from coming to the southern African nation. I had six quotas for elephant trophy hunts for American clients,  Walker said in an interview last month in the Matetsi Lot 1 in northwestern Zimbabwe near Victoria Falls.  I spent a lot of money to get those quotas. Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority Director-General Edison Chidziya traveled to Washington last year to lobby against the ban, which government officials say will cost the southern African nation vital foreign exchange. Before the ban, Zimbabwe was expecting to earn about $60 million from trophy hunting this year, up from $45 million last year. Via: BloombergImages from the luxuryhunts.com websiteZero Hedge   Released by Wikileaks: QUIET DIPLOMACY  SUSPENDS ELEPHANT HUNTING IN NATIONAL PARKS   FOR NOW    a Confidential memo sent on October 23, 2008 by the current US ambassador to Zimbabwe, James D. Mcgee, to the CIA.In it we read that, as usual, there is none more culpable of the recent event in Zimbabwe, which incidentally is and has been quite permitted by the local authorities as long as everyone s palms are appropriately greased, than the US government, which years ago was fully aware that Americans were killing lions in Hwange National Park, but that its concern was not with the dead animals   no matter how hard the administration tries to feign empathy for the beheaded lion here and now   but with Americans getting caught in the act. As has just happened.But first, here is some background on how legal local poaching, whether it is for lions or elephants is. From the formerly classified memo:Meeting with poloff and conoff on October 10, Bown said that it was unclear  how legal  these hunting operations were, since it appeared the hunters had permits issued by Parks to kill the animals, despite the provision in the National Parks Act that prohibits commercial hunting. The photographic safari operators indicated Parks had given several local and South African hunting companies concessions to kill elephants in Hwange if they met specific criteria: (1) total ivory weight less than 30 pounds, (2) young/adolescent males, (3) isolated areas (i.e. away from watering holes and main roads), and (4) controlled by Parks staff. Parks has never publicly stated these criteria or explained the operation. Frustrated photographic safari operators weighed and photographed many of the tusks at the Park s ivory store in Hwange and found that many were over 30 pounds each. In one case, an operator claimed an American hunter killed an elephant with tusks weighing over 120 pounds. Photos also show some elephants were killed very near main roads and close to watering holes. In at least one reported case, a vehicle drove around the animal before the hunter killed it at close range. In emails to Mtsambiwa and Nhema, safari operators decried the unethical hunting both in terms of the detrimental ecological impact and the negative impact it would have on their own businesses.  the safari operators also reported that some of the hunting guides had been issued hundreds of hunting permits for elephants in Hwange and other national parks in mid-to-late August. Normally, hunting permits are offered in an auction to all professional hunting guides. In contrast, Bown said these recent permits were issued through a non-transparent process to professional hunters of ill-repute, including some South African operators.So both the Zimbabwe ambassador and the CIA knew Zimbabwe was permitting and flaunting its own  regulations  when it comes to poaching if the fee is good enough. And, since American citizens were involved, the fee most certainly was:Despite Mtsambiwa s assurances at our August meeting that Parks was only planning a management/training exercise for Parks staff, in early September poloff received an email from an American citizen in California, asking about an advertisement for an elephant hunt in Zimbabwe to hunt five elephants over ten days for USD 6,000 as part of a culling exercise. The meat from the animals would go to local villagers and hunters were expected to help with on-site butchering of the animals. This price is significantly less than most elephant hunting packages. Normally, elephant hunting excursions in Zimbabwe cost about USD 1,000 per day, plus a fee for each animal killed. The hunting operation was to be led by Zimbabwean Headman Sibanda and was arranged by Thomas Powers Internationale, based in Colorado. Where was the disgust then? Oh yes, elephants are not cute animals about which Broadway musicals are written.However, there is a problem, because reading on we find that not only did the government know about everything that was going on involving US poachers, quite legal and paying very well, involving the hunting of elephants, but also, drumroll, lions.Bown, Save Valley Conservancy Director Clive Stockil and other conservationists opined in conversations with us that hunting permits were issued by Parks under intense pressure from its politicized board and ZANU-PF. Bown believed this frantic last grab at hunting revenue was one more aspect of ZANU-PF insiders  efforts to strip assets and fill their pockets before losing power to the MDC. She said that the same small group of hunters involved in this operation had been consistently involved in unethical and marginally legal hunting. Bown had no evidence that they were involved specifically with sanctioned individuals within the Mugabe regime, but believed such connections were likely. According to Bown, the Zimbabwean professional hunters involved include Guy Whitall, Tim Schultz of African Dream Safaris, Headman Sibanda and Wayne Grant of Nyala Safaris, Evans Makanza, Alan Shearing, Buzz Charlton and James Macullam of Charlton Macullum Safaris, A.J. Van Heerden of Shashe Safaris, Barry Van Heerden of Big Game Safaris, and Lawrence Boha. (COMMENT: Numerous conservationists have suggested the Van Heerden brothers are involved in suspicious hunting and land deals with the Director of the Central Intelligence Organization, Happyton Bonyongwe, although none have provided proof of the relationship. END COMMENT.)Additionally, one safari operator accused an American, by name, of killing a lion illegally and then smuggling its hide out through South Africa. Given the rampant smuggling of other animal products across Zimbabwe s southern border (reftel), this is not unlikely. As reported in reftel, American hunting dollars are vital to Zimbabwe s conservation efforts, but there are also serious risks that Americans could be implicated in smuggling and poaching operations.And there you have it: while blaming Walter Palmer is easy, the truth is that at its core, the death of Cecil, as well as countless other lions, elephants, rhinos and other animals, is solely as a result of the Zimbabwe government s corruption. A corruption, which the US government knew all about, and which also knew that US hunters were killing not only elephants but lions.The government s only real concern: the  serious risks that Americans could be implicated in smuggling and poaching operations. And now that an American has been implicated in poaching, what does the government do? It generously offers to  help the Zimbabwe government investigate the killing  of Cecil. Even though both Zimbabwe and the US government have tacitly approval of just this kind of behavior for years.

They don t do anything without an ulterior motive stealing the vote is their ulterior motive The Service Employees International Union is teaming up with four Latino advocacy organizations and a key House Democrat to convert as many of the 5 million Latino permanent residents into U.S. citizens and voters as possible before Election Day.Leading the charge is Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who said Thursday that he believes the  stand up to hate  push can get 1 million of those Latinos naturalized by May, which would see them become citizens in time to register for the presidential election.The campaign s mantra is  Naturalize.

14281,"“We choose the nominee, not the people” – GOP Official [Video]"," The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That s the conflict here,  Curly Haugland, an unbound GOP delegate from North Dakota, told CNBC s  Squawk Box  on Wednesday. He even questioned why primaries and caucuses are held. Political parties, not voters, choose their presidential nominees, a Republican convention rules member told CNBC, a day after GOP front-runner Donald Trump rolled up more big primary victories. The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That s the conflict here,  Curly Haugland, an unbound GOP delegate from North Dakota, told CNBC s  Squawk Box  on Wednesday. He even questioned why primaries and caucuses are held.Haugland is one of 112 Republican delegates who are not required to cast their support for any one candidate because their states and territories don t hold primaries or caucuses.Even with Trump s huge projected delegate haul in four state primaries Tuesday, the odds are increasing the billionaire businessman may not ultimately get the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the GOP nomination before the convention.This could lead to a brokered convention, in which unbound delegates, like Haugland, could play a significant swing role on the first ballot to choose a nominee.Most delegates bound by their state s primary or caucus results are only committed on the first ballot. If subsequent ballots are needed, virtually all of the delegates can vote any way they want, said Gary Emineth, another unbound delegate from North Dakota. It could introduce Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, or it could be the other candidates that have already been in the race and are now out of the race [such as] Mike Huckabee [or] Rick Santorum.

1722, Trump Is Trying To Force Dems’ Hand On Border Wall Funding – Here’s Why He’ll Fail BIGLY,"Donald Trump seems to think he can squeeze Congressional Democrats for border wall funding by offering them something in exchange, and he also seems to believe he s hit the jackpot on just what to exchange. He ll hold subsidy payments to insurers on the Obamacare exchanges hostage until Democrats agree to fund his wall. If they continue to stonewall, then, when the ACA s insurance marketplace implodes or the government shuts down (or both), he ll blame Democrats and the whole country will, too.He s not seeing both sides, though. The Democrats actually hold all the good cards here.Why? Surely we can see how both sides have a decent hand, can t we? Trump s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, even said: We d offer them $1 of CSR payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. A one-for-one trade sounds nice and equitable, doesn t it? Trump gets his wall and we get continued stability in the health insurance market, and the government keeps operating. Here s what he s not seeing: Democrats aren t the only ones who don t want to waste money on a big wall along the southern border. Many Republicans don t, either, and that gives Democrats major leverage over Trump.Chuck Schumer s spokesman issued a statement that said: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.[I]f the administration would drop their 11th-hour demand for a wall that Democrats   and a good number of Republicans   oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Some in the GOP have privately said that it would help if the Trump White House would move on from the border wall because there are too many in Congress who don t want to fund it. Furthermore, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are busy working toward creating a more bipartisan spending bill. But they know that, with control of the entire federal government, they will own a healthcare disaster and they will own a shutdown no matter what Trump decides to say about it.Republicans want to avoid a shutdown   they ve long since figured out that the country blamed them for the 2013 shutdown. That means working with Democrats, including scrapping funding for the wall if doing so means Democrats will agree to other things.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recognizes that Democrats have all the leverage here, and that they need to use that leverage to their advantage. Republicans control both Congress and the White House   people are not going to blame Democrats for a shutdown or for destabilizing the insurance marketplace under these circumstances.Mulvaney actually thinks that Congress should get out of the way of Trump s agenda: This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules. The border wall is a non-starter and possibly dead, at least for now. There are more important things to think about than a wall that won t do anything that Trump claims it will.Featured image by Shawn Thew   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017",trump border wall something exchange subsidy wall insurance government country sides sides hand budget director wall offer trade wall stability health insurance market government money wall border leverage spokesman statement house gambit hostage health care millions order bill wall president non starter administration hour demand wall number deal trump house border wall congress congress spending bill control government disaster matter shutdown country shutdown wall house minority leader nancy leverage leverage advantage congress house people shutdown insurance congress way trump agenda president seat table senate border wall starter wall anything image thew pool
7160, So Much For Outreach: Black Staffers Are Jumping Ship From The RNC,"When Republicans examined why they lost the 2012 Presidential Election, leadership concluded that they needed better outreach to groups such as women and African-Americans. And it s not going well.As it turns out, the Republican National Committee began by hiring some black employees to head up the outreach program in order to bring more black voters to the party.But as Donald Trump soars in popularity among white supremacists and gets ever closer to capturing the Republican nomination, the national director of African-American Initiatives at the RNC appears to have decided to throw in the towel on that effort to work for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan instead.In a statement to Huffington Post, Kristal Quarker-Hartsfield failed to mention why she chose to leave the RNC, saying only that she enjoyed her time working there and praised Reince Priebus as a good leader. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. she said. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader. It could merely be a coincidence that Quarker-Hartsfield just happens to be abandoning her post at a time when it s likely the racist Trump has destroyed just about every effort the GOP has tried to attract minority voters.But when you consider that three other black staffers have jumped ship over the last few months, it becomes less of a coincidence and more of a sign.Huffington Post reports:Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year.Though Williams denies that he left the RNC because of Trump or the racist rhetoric that has taken over the GOP, one can t help but wonder if it bothers him and the other black staffers on any level.Clearly, the RNC is experiencing problems reaching out to minority voters and Trump is making that effort even more difficult as Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and Muslims have all been targeted by Trump supporters and Trump s nasty rhetoric.It certainly appears that with Trump in the lead, some black staffers at the RNC just didn t want to waste their time trying to reach out to voters because it is kinda hard to convince minority voters that your party isn t racist when a racist has been all but crowned as the Republican nominee. It also makes one wonder how these staffers could be Republicans in the first place.

15340,[VIDEO] SHERIFF CLARKE EXPOSES THE LEFT: “This (Ferguson protests) Is Nothing More Than An Attempt To Try To Energize and Mobilize The Black Vote Through The 2016 Election”," A bunch of thugs, a bunch of creeps, criminals, race hustlers  with a scattering of law abiding people converged in this area and ripped the town up again. I would ve like to think this phony (#BlackLivesMatter) Movement Would ve Come Back To Apologize To The Good Law-Abiding People Of Ferguson, MO, but instead, we get this whole phony movement. In the first round there was an over-reliance by the police on avoiding confrontation. Look, the police are not looking for confrontation, but if someone s gonna bring the fight, then they have to respond quickly. If there s looting, if there s gun fire like last night, if there s rioting, if there s other sort of criminal behavior, law enforcement needs to use the resources they have.  Respond quickly and crush it. And give the impression to these individuals  that this stuff is not gonna stand. They re (the left) gonna keep this thing going and it s an unfortunate thing.

9462,WOW! LIBERAL Fox News Host Geraldo Rivera SLAMS Hypocrisy of Left For Ignoring Sexual Assault Allegations Against Bill Clinton,"Liberal FOX News host, Geraldo Rivera, took to Twitter to express his disgust over the hypocritical left and their selective outrage over sex harassment allegations based on the political party of the accused.Geraldo Rivera asked the left a very good question,  Why are so many who profess to be outraged &amp; repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton? so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ? Why are so many who profess to be outraged & repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton ?  so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ?  Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) November 10, 2017While the media shark-tank surrounded Trump, hoping to prove the ALLEGED sexual harassment charges (Not surprisingly, after Trump won the election, all of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct have gone into hiding)  against him  were real, they refused to even consider the confessions of multiple women against Bill Clinton and his enabling wife during the campaign. The real difference, of course, is that the women accusing Bill Clinton of sexual assault, have been screaming from the rooftops for decades about the sexual abuse they endured by the former governor of Arkansas.Rivera brought up another great point in his tweet as it relates to the fake Trump-Russian dossier story that the left has been apoplectic about since the news broke in the liberal media several months ago. It appears, however, that the left has already forgotten the reason Bill Clinton was impeached after lying to a federal grand jury about having sexual encounters with a 19-year old intern in the Oval Office while serving as our nation s President.Meanwhile, it s also curious how many RINO s in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said that without any investigation or opportunity to prove that any of the allegations of sexual misconduct against 3 minors are untrue, that Republican candidate for US Senate, Judge Roy Moore (AL), should step down. Does anyone remember telling Hillary to  step down  because there should never be a geriatric pervert allowed to roam the halls of the White House putting visitors and the staff in potential danger of sexual assault? For that matter, does anyone remember telling Bill Clinton to  step down  when he was accused of sexual assault over and over again while he was running for the office of the President of the United States? The answer is  no , there was no such call for either Clinton to  step down  and give up their political ambitions.This isn t the first time Fox News host Geraldo Rivera, who is a self-described liberal, has spoken out against the hypocrisy of the left. In February 2017, Rivera resigned from a voluntary position at Yale University after the school decided to change the name of a residential college that honors a slavery supporter.Rivera said Sunday on Twitter that he resigned as an associate fellow of Calhoun College. He said the position was an honor  but intolerant insistence on political correctness is lame.

10672,BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video],"Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",nothing trump tucker end interview house person house way watch sense brilliance piece review something chair paragraph interview interview confidant chief staff state department fix investigation reason justice department witness subject investigation attorney client privilege behalf order attempt procedure state department participant procedure procedure government business state capacity lawyer secretary state department moreover chief staff secure blackberry president actor investigation lawyer state department state department lawyer connection matter lawyer officer employee way lawyer process state department justice department attorney client privilege claim ability aspect investigation interview capacity lawyer lawyer government official
3559, Paul Ryan Just Gave The Most CRINGEWORTHY Response To Trump’s Illegal Voters Lie (VIDEO),"President-elect Donald Trump has been a sore subject for Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). Not only did Ryan speak out against Trump multiple times during his presidential campaign (but stopped short of pulling his endorsement), but Ryan is getting exceedingly worse at defending the President-elect as time goes on.Last night, Ryan gave an extremely awkward, cringeworthy interview on CBS  60 Minutes. Every time Scott Pelley tried to grill Ryan on Trump, the Speaker of the House pretty much crumbled under the pressure.The most hilarious part of the interview was when Pelley asked Ryan about Trump s recent claim that  millions of people  voted illegally, therefore costing him the popular vote. Pelley asked: Trump tweeted in the last week or so that he had actually won the popular vote if you deduct the millions that voted illegally. Do you believe that? You can practically see Ryan s skin crawling. Ryan was noticeably uncomfortable with the question, and went into survival mode by playing dumb. REAL dumb. Blinking uncomfortably, Ryan said, I don t know, I m not really focused on these things. Pelley cornered Ryan and pressed him, Wait a minute, wait a minute. You have an opinion on whether millions of Americans voted illegally.  And Ryan got even dumber, right before our eyes. He said: I have no way of backing that up. I have no knowledge of such things. Ryan eventually gave up and without ever really answering the question, he said: It doesn t matter to me. He won the election. You can watch the humiliating interview below:It s no secret that Ryan and Trump have had a rocky relationship. Unfortunately, these super-awkward interviews are about to become more frequent, as Trump and Ryan try to get along and make some sort of peace before Trump begins his term.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"December 5, 2016",president trump sore subject speaker house rep wi trump times campaign endorsement president time night interview time trump speaker house pressure part interview trump claim millions people vote trump week vote millions skin question mode blinking minute wait minute opinion millions way knowledge question matter election humiliating interview trump relationship awkward trump try sort peace trump term image
21093,"BRITISH MAN GOES UNDERCOVER, Makes Chilling Video In “Welcoming” Neighborhood Mosque"," If she doesn t wear a hijab, we hit her This is truly a shocking undercover film. It exposes the wide network of Muslim radicals and how they have no intention of assimilating with Westerners.  The things that are said in this film should make every American and European question what really takes place in these  neighborhood mosques. Marrying off a girl before puberty is permissible. None of this has been stopped in Britain by the government, who did not care to protect thousands of children raped, threatened, sold, drugged and many even killed by Muslim men. This mentality amongst Muslims that the video shows, especially Sunni Muslims, will be common in virtually every single mosque not only in Britain, but throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US.The Muslim hatred continues to flourish throughout the country, all because of a weak and incompetent leadership and EU policies that protect hate preachers and terrorism. The permission for Islam to grow and exist   a fascist ideology of the medieval ages   is the root cause of growing terrorism growing and expanding into the West.It is not difficult to see what Britain s future will be. Islam is a far greater threat than Nazism. But the Nazi s did not infiltrate the country and was easier to battle.Prime Minister Tony Blair recently described tolerance as  what makes Britain Britain  but in this extensive investigation Dispatches reveals how a message of hatred and segregation is being spread throughout the UK and examines how it is influenced by the religious establishment of Saudi Arabia.Dispatches has investigated a number of mosques run by high profile national organisations that claim to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths. But an undercover reporter joined worshippers to find a message of religious bigotry and extremism being preached.He captures chilling sermons in which Saudi-trained preachers proclaim the supremacy of Islam, preach hatred for non-Muslims and for Muslims who do not follow their extreme beliefs   and predict a coming jihad.  An army of Muslims will arise,  announces one preacher. Another preacher said British Muslims must  dismantle  British democracy   they must  live like a state within a state  until they are  strong enough to take over. The investigation reveals Saudi Arabian universities are recruiting young Western Muslims to train them in their extreme theology, then sending them back to the West to spread the word. And the Dispatches reporter discovers that British Muslims can ask for fatwas, religious rulings, direct from the top religious leader in Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mufti.Via: The Muslim Issue",left-news,"Jan 20, 2016",shocking undercover film network intention film question place neighborhood girl puberty none government men mentality amongst video mosque canada country leadership hate terrorism permission ideology medieval root cause terrorism west future threat country battle minister tony blair tolerance investigation message segregation establishment number moderation dialogue reporter message bigotry extremism supremacy preach non extreme army preacher preacher democracy state state investigation theology west word leader mufti issue

8674, Meet The AWESOME Couple Who Is Going To Heckle The Bundy Militia Until They Leave,"For more than two weeks now, the nation has watched in frustration as a band of wannabe  patriots  who are nothing more than domestic terrorists have continuously disrupted the lives of the good people of Harney County, Oregon with their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. Well, it seems that these fools may have met their match.Kieran Suckling, who is the Executive Director of the Center for Biological Diversity, says that there is a couple who is challenging the armed idiots in their own way, and it is nothing short of glorious. According the the Center s Facebook: Each night, these two tent camp in the rain and snow. Each morning, they wake up, warm up, and go down the road to protest the Bundy militia s daily press conference. They won t leave until the militants do, they say. They are here, they say, because our laws and public land deserve the dignity and protection of people standing up peacefully yet forcefully against those who would steal them at gunpoint. I love these people. We offered them a warm room at our hotel, but they declined, saying that the land needed people who love it to be present at all times. What this unidentified couple is doing is nothing short of heroic. It is certainly more than the authorities are doing. These fools have been disrupting lives, terrorizing the locals, destroying property and committing any number of felonies unchecked for way too long as it is. Kudos to these REAL patriots for standing up to them.Suckling said that on Monday, there was to be a celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, and expressed his thoughts on what Dr. King would think of this occupation, and how he would react: Dr. King understood nature deeply, teaching us  It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly. But we ll also peacefully confront the Bundy militia at the buildings and land they have taken from us all by armed force. We believe that is what Martin Luther King, Jr. would do. We must bear witness to this great injustice and show the militia thugs that America won t be scared away from its public lands by guns and threats. So right. It really is great that people are finally standing up to the these militants, with or without the help of law enforcement.That couple deserves a medal for what they are doing.Featured image via Raw Story",News,"January 18, 2016",nation frustration band nothing people county occupation wildlife refuge well match director center diversity couple way nothing center night tent camp rain morning road militia press conference land dignity protection people people room hotel land people times couple nothing heroic property number way celebration martin holiday occupation king nature deeply life caught network mutuality garment destiny militia land force martin king witness injustice militia people help law enforcement couple medal image story
4393, Clinton Just Expertly Trolled Trump With This Very Special Calculator,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has wasted no time using the New York Times  bombshell that was dropped on Saturday. The revelation was that Republican presidential candidate Donald trump may have manipulated his taxes to make it so that he has not had to pay income taxes for two decades. Now, Clinton is trolling Trump hard with a special tax calculator that shows exactly how much a person would pay in income taxes if they were Trump. The joke is pretty straightforward. Type in your annual income and the calculator shows the same amount of money owed in taxes is exactly $0. Clinton s campaign website also displays a message that reads: Donald Trump says it s because he s smart. The New York Times says it s because he lost almost a billion dollars. Either way, Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years after losing $916 million in 1995. And Trump really did pay zero, or nearly zero, in federal income taxes in 1978, 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1993. Until we see evidence otherwise, we ll assume it s still zero. Clinton s campaign manager, Robby Mook just released a statement on the matter. In the statement Mook said that: He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that  smart. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking decades worth of tradition. Most people on the left assumed he had something to hide. Now we have a bit more of an idea of what exactly he is hiding. Since the revelation, Trump has been lambasted by many individuals. Notably, Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who said that Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father.  Reid also called for the passing of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. The PTTA would make it mandatory for presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they seek the office of the presidency.Featured image from screenshot",News,"October 2, 2016",candidate time york times revelation candidate trump income tax calculator person income joke type income calculator amount money campaign message york times way trump income income evidence campaign manager statement matter statement millions trump tax tradition people left something bit idea revelation trump senator harry trump dollar loser brat millions father passing tax transparency tax office presidency image
2725," Trump Uses Prayer Breakfast To Mock Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gets HUMILIATED In 14 Priceless Seconds","Donald Trump literally used the National Prayer Breakfast to brag about the low ratings of the new  Celebrity Apprentice  hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,  Trump said on Thursday morning in the middle of the event.  The ratings went right down the tubes, it s been a total disaster  and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings. Seriously!? How can anybody who calls themselves a Christian support Trump after this? He actually used the prayer breakfast to attack a television show and bully the new host. And this is a television show that Trump is credited as an executive producer.Of all the things that he could have focused on at the breakfast, like homelessness, hunger, peace, or even the dead Navy Seal and eight-year-old girl who were killed during a military raid he ordered over the weekend, he chose to brag about the ratings of his former reality show and asked everyone to pray for it.But Arnold Schwarzenegger soon issued a response to Trump on Twitter in the form of a video message that is sure to have Trump fuming for the rest of the day. Hey, Donald, I have a great idea,  he said.  Why don t we switch jobs? You take over TV   because you re such an expert in ratings   and I take over your job so then people can finally sleep comfortably again? The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE  Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017Indeed, if Trump is so concerned about the ratings of his former show, he should resign and go host it again while Schwarzenegger, who actually has governing experience, takes over the presidency.A representative for Schwarzenegger also delivered this burn. Arnold is praying that President Trump can improve his own approval ratings, which were the worst in history of any incoming president, by taking his job seriously and working inclusively. Donald Trump is an embarrassment and disgrace to this country. He is totally unqualified to be president and he should be tossed out on his ass in favor of someone like Schwarzenegger.

527, The One Major Reason Trump Won’t Give Up On His Support For White Supremacists,"Last week was the week it became official that Donald Trump isn t even trying to be President of the United States. His horrible responses to the Neo-nazi/KKK/White Supremacist hate rally in Charlottesville, Virginia proves that he s only concerned with a tiny portion of the United States, and that s his frightening and adoring base.While Trump s approval ratings continue to fall among most Americans, his base is lapping up Trump s attempts at spurring on racial division.A GOP strategist working campaigns in red and purple states said that while support for Trump generally declined slightly since Charlottesville, support rose among his base, after a decline last month because of the failure on health care and revelations about the Russia investigation. This strategist said many Trump supporters applaud the president s continuing desire to shake up Washington, favor his economic priorities and admire his willingness to speak his mind.Source: Washington PostPolitically, this is stupid.But he said Trump has nonetheless created a longer-term risk.  What he s doing that s harmful is he s removing people from the persuadable audience, and that s dangerous,  he said.  He s taken an event where he could have added 5 percent of people to the persuadable universe and [instead] he s dumped out 10 percent of them. Trump doesn t care, though. The sycophantic worship is far more important to Trump than any sort of reelection strategy and it s certainly more important to him than the future of the Republican Party   a party that s only in office because of gerrymandering, voter suppression and really undemocratic (both small and big  D ) campaign finance laws.For Trump, appealing to the worst in humanity is that only strategy that works and there is absolutely no sign he ll be letting up on it anytime soon. In fact, the now ousted Steve Bannon, back at the helm of the white supremacist site Breitbart, is vowing to use his platform to keep Trump focused on his nationalist agenda.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2017",week week trump president hate rally portion frightening base trump approval base trump division strategist support trump support base decline month failure health care russia investigation strategist trump president desire favor willingness mind source trump term risk harmful people audience event percent people universe percent care worship sort strategy future party party office voter suppression campaign finance trump humanity strategy sign fact helm site platform trump agenda image
7772," After The Second White Supremacist Attack In 2 Days, Republicans Respond With Dead Silence","A Trio of Neo-Nazi, Confederate flag-waving white supremacists are now in custody after screaming  HEIL HITLER!  and engaging in a knife attack on a small group of Latino children and a family that tried to intervene on behalf of the kids.The Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department received calls at approximately 4:30 p.m. from people who were reporting the incident. Witnesses told Police that the men were screaming racial slurs, and one of them was waving a wallet with a Confederate flag on it, as they were attacking the teens and family. The family arrived on the scene after the group had already began harassing the teenagers, and that s when the offenders drew knives on the group. The father of the family, who wanted to remain anonymous, said:They just started beating them up. They started coming towards us, and they pulled out some knives, and they were saying they would kill us.Source: RawstoryPolice said that they will be investigating the attack as a hate crime, for obvious reasons. There were no injuries, but this is the second attack that has happened by white supremacists in two days in California. In Anaheim one day earlier, a KKK rally turned into a street brawl that ended with a Klansman impaling 3 people with the tip of a flagpole. The second incident had a happier ending, because there were no serious injuries and these people will actually be prosecuted for a crime. In the flagpole incident, police said that the KKK  stabbed in self-defense,  so they were released from custody.With the Ku Klux Klan officially endorsing the person who is about to win the Republican nomination for president, it brings to mind that there may be an escalating occurrence of hate crimes as America keeps rewarding racism and bigotry with ever-growing poll numbers and success.

13336,WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO],"That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking home through his affluent Washington DC neighborhood. He was beaten and shot in the back, but apparently nothing of any value was taken from his body, which would likely mean robbery was not a motive. If robbery wasn t a motive and the police still have no clues what exactly was the motive for his brutal murder? In our previous article, we explored the possibility that he may have been about to blow the whistle on voter fraud. Does anyone have an actual tally of the number of people who had ties to the Clintons that ended up dead? Now Bernie Sanders supporter and activist Shawn Lucas is found dead.On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.According to Snopes Lucas was found dead on his bathroom floor.We contacted Lucas  employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas  death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas  cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.

2296, ‘Lunatic’: Huge Backlash From Lawmakers After Trump’s ‘Wiretap’ Accusations,"Reality show star turned  so-called  president Donald Trump alleged in a tweetstorm this morning that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower s  wires tapped  before the election. The only place Trump could have gotten that disinformation is from fake news  site Breitbart.com. Trump has some  splainin  to do over that conspiratorial tweet. Like, for example, what the f*ck he s talking about. For sure, former President Barack Obama has no idea what Trump what Trump is referring to.Trump called Obama  bad  or  sick  during his tweet frenzy, all while offering no proof to back up his jaw-dropping claims.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing the scope of Russia s influence on the US election, said in a statement Saturday afternoon in regards to one of Trump s tweets this morning,  If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man,  Schiff said.Trump s baseless accusations backfired. Now Democrats want an investigation.Don't be distracted by Trump & his lunatic rants. We need an independent investigation into #Trumprussia now. https://t.co/tyIErE8GcP  Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) March 4, 2017Trump is in  deep shit.

Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 2017It s not just Democrats. GOP Sen. Ben Sasse said on Saturday that Trump owes the public a further explanation of his bizarre allegation against Obama. The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,  Sasse said, according to Politico.  If without [an authorization], the President should explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this. It is possible that he was illegally tapped. But Sasse added that there are legalities to a wiretap. If it was with a legal FISA court order, then an application for surveillance exists that the court found credible. The president should ask that this full application regarding surveillance of foreign operatives or operations be made available, ideally to the full public, and at a bare minimum to the U.S. Senate,  Sasse said.Maybe if Trump released his tax returns, we could learn more.

21317,Why Do Hillary And Barack Choose Islam Over Christianity Every Time?,"The always brilliant Ben Shapiro answers that question in well, a brilliant way On Tuesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the American woman most responsible for the current refugee crisis in the Middle East, blasted Republicans for not wanting to accept unvetted Syrian Muslim refugees in the aftermath of last week s Paris terror attacks.She tweeted:We've seen a lot of hateful rhetoric from the GOP. But the idea that we'd turn away refugees because of religion is a new low. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 17, 2015 This, to be sure, is odd. Hillary decrying hateful rhetoric smacks of irony   she despises Republicans so much that she labeled them her enemies during the first Demoratic debate. Furthermore, Hillary is no fighter for religious freedom. In April, she told the Women in the World Summit that  deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed  to allow for abortion. And in the aftermath of the Supreme Court s egregious same-sex marriage decision in June, Hillary explicitly called for the government to force churches to sanction homosexuality, explaining,  Our work won t be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice.  Pray   as in attend church  free from discrimination and prejudice. But she s sure hot and bothered about what she terms discrimination against Muslim refugees. This isn t particularly surprising   the entire left has a peculiar soft spot for Islam.That seems weird, given Islamic countries  fundamental rejection of leftist values ranging from same-sex marriage to abortion to women driving. But it isn t so weird when considered in the context of Marxist philosophy, which sees Islam not as a religious philosophy of its own, but as a sort of bizarre cultural outgrowth of poverty. Impoverished people believe weird things, say the Marxists; if we just gave ISIS jobs, they d stop all this nonsense and start behaving like members of the ACLU. Leftists see Islam not as an ideological force converting millions, but as a knee-jerk response to lack of basic living standards.In fact, leftists see all religion this way: as the refuge of the weakminded underclass. As Marx wrote,  Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.  Barack Obama agrees: as he said back in 2008, poor people  get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them. The view that all religious practice is essentially the domain of the exploited would cut in favor of seeing all religious practices as equally worthy of dismissal.But the left prefers Islam to Christianity. They ll fight against anyone drawing pictures of Mohammed, but they ll lose their minds if Christians complain about an  artist  soaking a statue of Jesus in urine.Why do leftists treat Christianity and Islam differently, if both are merely chimerical responses to the vicissitudes of life? Because leftists see Christianity as the creator of Islam s rise, and Christians as the victimizers of Muslims. The Obama State Department won t recognize Christians as victims of incipient Muslim genocide in the Middle East, but President Obama will equate ISIS violence in 2015 with the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition. President Obama believes, like many on the left, that Western civilization was founded in racism, sexism, homophobia, and other bigotry   and that Christianity, as its wellspring, provided that impetus.Furthermore, Obama believes that Western civilization has exploited the rest of the world, and that it therefore bears culpability for the poverty that gave rise to the Islamic wave. Muslims are benighted victims of poverty; Christianity made them victims of poverty in the first place. Christianity thus bears blood guilt for the sins of Islam, but Islam bears none of its own. As Dinesh D Souza puts it, Obama is an anti-colonialist and believes  that the rich countries got rich by looting the poor countries, and that within the rich countries, plutocratic and corporate elites continue to exploit ordinary citizens.  Taken one step further, those rich countries   Christian countries   exploited non-Christian countries, impoverishing them and opening them to the opium of Islam.How else to explain the left s romance with Islam and simultaneous dismissal of Christianity? How else to explain the left s preoccupation with allowing Muslim refugees into the Christianity-founded West while demanding nothing of Islamic countries which are murdering Christians en masse?Hillary Clinton says it s hateful for Western countries to discriminate in choosing refugees based on religious philosophy. It s far more hateful to suggest that Christianity must bow and scrape before Islam, particularly when Islamic terrorists target non-Muslims the world over.

21308,DISNEY OWNED ABC SHOW “Scandal” Shows Actress Having Abortion While “Silent Night” Plays And Narrator Says: “Family doesn’t complete you…it destroys you” [VIDEO] UPDATE: ‘Scandal’ Producer Sits On Planned Parenthood Board," Family doesn t complete you it destroys you? Wow way to promote families Disney There s nothing like a one-hour promotion of Planned Parenthood (baby parts harvester for profit) from the corporation who owes their success to live children. Anyone who supports the Disney Corporation should be asking them how they can market their amusement parks to live children, calling their parks the  The happiest place on earth,  when they openly glorify the killing of children on national TV? Feel free to leave a comment by clicking this LINKWell, now that we ve gotten that out the way, we thought you might like to know who produces the show, Scandal:The Planned Parenthood abortion business ultimately praised the episode and actors on the show defended the decision to show the killing of an unborn baby in an abortion during the Christmas song.That the abortion giant loved the episode is no surprise given its content, but it s also no surprise since Scandal s creator and producer is on the board of directors of one of its affiliates. As LifeNews blogger Ryan Bomberger pointed out on Twitter, Scandal creator Shonda Rimes sits on the baord of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles: The abortion episode was a natural for Rhimes: she previously showed her fondness for abortion by featuring it in her hit show,  Grey s Anatomy.  In real life, she sits on the board of Planned Parenthood s Los Angeles affiliate; this is a curious decision for a black woman the organization was founded on racist principles,  Donohue continued. Why the need to play  Silent Night  while the kid is killed? Rhimes is angry it s payback time. She went to a Catholic high school where she was disciplined for wearing  too-short skirts.  She never got over it. Hence, her juvenile rebelliousness. The composite picture isn t pretty it s a mess,  he said.Rhimes has three daughters and no husband and she talked about that in an interview. I have never wanted to get married. I love having boyfriends. I love dating. I do not want a husband in my house,  she said.Rhimes is no stranger to popular television programs. She is the is the creator and currently executive producer and head writer of Grey s Anatomy and Rhimes created and produced the Grey s Anatomy spin-off series Private Practice Then, in 2011, ABC ordered Rhimes s pilot script Scandal to series. Unfortunately, it appears Rhimes is committed to pushing her pro-abortion agenda in them.In an interview with Time last year, Rhimes said that televisions shows should tackle abortion because it is a  polarizing issue:   Because it is such a hot button issue, because people are debating it, it should be discussed. And I m not sure why it s not being discussed. ACTION: Click here to tell ABC to stop promoting abortion.Thursday night s episode of Shonda Rhimes s ABC series Scandal was an hour-long advertisement for Planned Parenthood   so much so that the organization released a statement praising Rhimes and the episode immediately after it aired.In the fifth-season episode, titled  Baby, It s Cold Outside,  main character Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington), wife of the Republican U.S. President, undergoes an abortion while the Christmas hymn  Silent Night  plays in the background. Concurrently, Republican Senator Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young) successfully filibusters a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood, allowing it to keep its funding.https://youtu.be/vnd7OxpRxN8The episode was so overtly pro-Planned Parenthood that the organization issued a statement immediately after it aired to praise Rhimes and the show  for proving that when women are telling our stories, the world will pause and watch :Tonight, the millions of people who tune into Scandal every Thursday night learned that our rights to reproductive health care are under attack. Never one to shy away from critical issues, Shonda Rhimes used her platform to tell the world that if Planned Parenthood lost funding for contraception counseling, STI testing, cancer screenings, and safe, legal abortion   millions of people would suffer. And this episode wasn t the first time one of Rhimes  characters had an abortion, yet tonight we saw one of our favorite characters make the deeply personal decision that one in three women have made in their lifetime. We applaud Shonda Rhimes tonight   and every Thursday night   for proving that when women are telling our stories, the world will pause and watch. We just hope those in Congress   and throughout the nation   who are steadfast on rolling the clock back on reproductive health care access are taking note.After getting the abortion, Olivia returns to the White House, where she sips on some red wine while the classical piece  Ave Maria  plays in the background.In its own statement, Media Research Center blasted the episode:Hollywood s liberal values permeate movies and television. Last night s episode of ABC s Scandal was pretty much an hour-long advertisement for Planned Parenthood. In the most disturbing scene, the main character has an abortion to  Silent Night  (a hymn celebrating the birth of Jesus) playing in the background. This is Hollywood s moral depravity on full display.#IStandWithMellie #IStandWithPlannedParenthood  kerry washington (@kerrywashington) November 20, 2015Actress Kerry Washington tweeted her support of Planned Parenthood last night, using the hashtags #IStandWithPlannedParenthood and #IStandWithMellie, in reference to Bellamy Young s character who was filibustering in the Senate against defunding Planned Parenthood.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Nov 20, 2015",family way nothing hour promotion parenthood baby harvester profit corporation success anyone corporation market amusement place earth killing comment way show scandal parenthood abortion business episode show decision killing baby abortion song abortion giant episode surprise content surprise scandal creator producer board twitter scandal creator parenthood abortion episode fondness abortion hit show anatomy life board parenthood affiliate decision woman organization racist need night time school rebelliousness picture mess husband interview husband house stranger television creator producer head writer grey anatomy grey anatomy series practice pilot script scandal series abortion agenda interview time year abortion issue button issue people action click abortion night episode series scandal hour advertisement parenthood organization statement episode fifth season episode baby character pope wife president abortion hymn night background senator grant bill parenthood episode parenthood organization statement show world tonight millions people scandal night health care attack platform world parenthood contraception cancer abortion millions people episode time abortion deeply decision lifetime night world congress nation clock health care access note abortion house wine piece maria background statement media research center episode television night episode scandal hour advertisement parenthood scene character abortion night hymn birth background depravity display kerry support parenthood night reference character senate parenthood news
16066,LAWYER SCAMS FEDS OUT OF $600 MILLION…Suddenly Disappears,"Why let this guy out EVER! He was let out on bond even though there was discussion of concern since he s a  world traveler with tax payer dollars! This guy made millions off of fraudulently scamming the SS disability system. He inadvertently called attention to the need for this program to be totally overhauled:The scandal prompted the federal government to review the eligibility of about 1,500 people receiving benefits About 800 of those people lost their benefits.  I was always shocked that, when he was arrested, he was actually allowed out on bond.    Lawyer who represents Conn s former clientsA slimy Eastern Kentucky disability lawyer scheduled to be sentenced next month for defrauding the government of nearly $600 million has disappeared, the FBI said.Eric Conn pleaded guilty in March to stealing from the federal government and bribing a judge. He was scheduled to be sentenced next month and had been ordered to pay the government tens of millions of dollars.But Saturday, the FBI said Conn removed his electronic monitoring device, violating the conditions of his bond and prompting the U.S. District Court to issue a warrant for his arrest. David Habich, general counsel for the FBI s Louisville office, said Conn s  whereabouts are currently unknown. A call to Conn s lawyer was not returned.Conn started his law practice in a trailer in 1993 and built it into one of the most lucrative disability law firms in the country. He created a persona for himself as  Mr. Social Security,  fueled by outlandish TV commercials and small-scale replicas of the Statute of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial at his office in rural eastern Kentucky.But Conn s empire crumbled when federal investigators uncovered he had been bribing a doctor and a judge to approve disability claims based on fake medical evidence. As part of his plea deal in March, he agreed to pay the federal government $5.7 million and to reimburse Social Security $46 million. A federal judge ordered Conn to pay $12 million in damages and $19 million in penalties to the government and two former Social Security employees who tried to expose the scheme. And Conn is also facing a liability judgment from a class action lawsuit brought by his former clients, with a hearing scheduled for later this month to determine the damages. It was totally predictable that he would flee,  said attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who represents Conn s former clients and said Conn s frequent world traveling was brought up in court to assess whether he was a flight risk.  I was always shocked that, when he was arrested, he was actually allowed out on bond. And there has been a betting pool going on in Prestonsburg on not if he would flee, but when. The scandal prompted the federal government to review the eligibility of about 1,500 people receiving benefits. Pillersdorf said about 800 of those people lost their benefits.Read more: Law Newz",Government News,"Jun 4, 2017",guy bond discussion concern world traveler tax payer guy millions disability system attention need program scandal government eligibility people people bond lawyer conn slimy disability lawyer month government conn march government judge month government millions conn device bond district court warrant arrest counsel office conn whereabouts call lawyer conn law practice trailer disability law country persona security scale statute liberty memorial office empire doctor judge disability evidence part plea deal march government security judge conn damages government security scheme conn liability judgment class action lawsuit hearing month damages attorney conn conn world traveling court flight risk bond pool scandal government eligibility people people law
1047," Obama Just Delivered His Most Scathing Rebuke Of Trumpcare Yet, And It’s Awesome (SCREENSHOTS)","President Obama typically refrains from outright blasting the f*ck out of Donald Trump, but he made an exception on Thursday as Republicans prepare to strip healthcare from millions of our most vulnerable Americans.On Facebook, Obama urged Republicans to reject Trumpcare and all it has to offer (which isn t much). I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,  Obama said.  Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,  he continued.  It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Simply put, if there s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family   this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation. That s the key word    meanness.  Trumpcare is designed not to help Americans, but to provide massive tax cuts for the richest Americans while leaving the rest of us to suffer. This debate has always been about something bigger than politics,  Obama added.  It s about the character of our country   who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that s always worth fighting for.

15931,PUERTO RICO: Local Cop Calls US Radio Station Tells Shocking Reason Aid Isn’t Getting To People [Video],"THIS IS SO IMPORTANT! The transcript and video  below should be shared by everyone because the lying politicians and media are in full anti-Trump mode right now.  A female police officer from Puerto Rico s police department in Guaynabo called in to a U.S. spanish speaking radio station to tell listeners what is going on in Puerto Rico. The police woman is very upset, crying and sobbing often, and shares how the Mayor of San Juan is politicizing the situation and not offering help.Note that the politicization of this disaster is on steroids with American celebrities claiming  genocide  by Trump and just outright lies by the politicians who are using this to score votes while the people suffer.The most visible of the politicians is the lying mayor who stood in front of supplies saying she needs help. Well, help is right behind you! What she didn t say is that truckers are not showing up to take the aid to the people! As it turns out, she hasn t been doing HER job and hasn t shown up for meetings with FEMA and the US military on sight. Here s just one of many ridiculous comments by this lying politician: The world will see how we are treated   not as second-class citizens, but as animals that can be disposed of,  said Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz.The call and video was recorded September 28th, and highlights the corruption within government within Puerto Rico and the Municipal authority of San Juan. The video is English closed captioned (hit  CC  option) and a transcript is below:Transcript:Radio Announcer: What is your name?Police Caller: I cannot give my name because I work for Puerto Rico s Police Department. I need to pass this information out because the stuff that is being brought from the U.S. is not being distributed. They are not allowing the Puerto Rican people to receive the donations.Radio Announcer: What part of Puerto Rico are you calling us from right now?Police Caller: I am right now in Guaynabo.Radio Announcer 2: Wow.Radio Announcer 3: But what information do you have? What have you seen?Police Caller: The Mayor, Carmen Yulin, is not allowing anyone to distribute  We need  what Puerto Ricans need is that the U.S. armed forces come in and distribute the aid. And that they stop the governor, Rosello, and the mayor, Yulin, on doing what they are doing  It s an abuse, it looks like communism, in our own island (sobbing)  (sobbing continues, inaudible translation due to cries) Police Caller (cont.): People are helping us, but they are not accepting it, they are not accepting anymore help supposedly:  they have to wait for the license, that there are no buses.   Let me tell you something Boricuas (Puerto Ricans) are dying of hunger (crying continues)   This is a bureaucracy, everything has to be protocol, the lines are stretched.  We can only give one box of water per person (sobbing continues).  The medics here, people are dying, the hospitals are in crisis.Police Caller (cont.): I am embarrassed, as a Boricua to work for Puerto Rico s police and see that we cannot do anything. There are dozens and thousands and thousands of food and when people ask we cannot give anything away because [Mayor] Carmen Yulin says that we cannot take anything out; because everything is a soap opera, everything is a show and there have to be cameras here and there.  .Because you know they are just looking for votes for the upcoming years.Radio Announcer 2: WowPolice Caller: And the governor won t move unless there is a camera behind him; [Mayor] Carmen Yulin won t move unless there is a camera behind her. This is how we are living in Puerto Rico, meanwhile artists are giving money and the people of Florida are sending stuff, and I don t know how many more people are helping because we have very limited communication, very limited, and we have no idea what s going on outside; and the people who are sending stuff, they have to come in; they have to come to help Puerto Rico and distribute what is being wasted  because what else are we going to do? You tell me, what are we going to do?Radio Announcer #2: Of course the desperation..Radio Announcer #3: We are with our hearts broken listening to you describing this situation which is heartbreaking when we know that so many people are helping  this is a police officer speaking.Police Caller: I ve been for one hour and a half just trying to download an application because the phones that they give to us I cannot use them as a police officer due to security measures. But I need to speak for the people because the people are suffering. Because I, as a cop, and other partners are seeing it. A lot of people have been posting videos (sobbing   inaudible)  and no-one is paying attention.Radio Announcer #3: We are truly sorry for this situation, we did not know that..Police Caller: If Cuba and Venezuela want to help and we are grateful for that; and that the government denies their help, the government denies Cuba s help.  That they reject Venezuela s help,  Look for God s sake! Tell me how is that possible, we need help.Radio Announcer #3: We are going to send this message out so that it gets to where it needs to get to Police Caller: We want the U.S. to come in, that the strongest forces come in and take the governor out, he is not doing anything, he is just going around and around,  and everyone is like:  oh, look how nice, the governor, he is going in the mud, he is going in the water , And where is it? Pardon the expression: WHERE IS THE FOOD?Police Caller (cont.): Look, grab the food, grab the sausage can and take it to the families! Stop the show! The governor is just doing a show, is all a show. There are many mayors that are suffering because they cannot do anything for their people.Radio Announcer #2: What are they doing with the food? Is it being kept in storage because they are not allowing to give it out?Police Caller: They are not doing anything, and they tell the harbors (ports) that they cannot bring stuff anymore. If the U.S. government doesn t get involved they will finish us. We are going to end up worse.  Worse than Cuba, Africa, or worse than Haiti. We are living in an era that you don t want to see, people are desperate. The gasoline, people are already killing each other. Not to rob you, they are doing it so they can be the firsts to get food and take it to their families.Police Caller (cont.): Do you know what it is when a woman approaches me and tells me  I don t have any more.   I don t know what else to give my kids because I don t have anymore.   Water and crackers !Radio Announcer #1: Sweetie, thank you for calling us and using this medium to denounce this situation; and good thing that it was you who explained this so that people don t think that we are making up stuff; because this has nothing to do with politics.

16965,BREAKING REPORT: Two Al Qaeda Terrorists Able To Enter U.S. As Refugees: “I wouldn’t be surprised if there were many more…”,"Our refugee resettlement program needs to bed stopped right now. We need to rethink and regroup on everything about it. The cost is HUGE but security is a big issue too. Here s one example :Two al Qaeda terrorists who had killed American soldiers were able to enter the country as refugees, according to a report released Wednesday from the House Homeland Security committee.Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, two Iraqi refugees settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky, after killing American soldiers, whom they bragged about having  for lunch and dinner.  In 2010, they were caught handling weapons, including included a machine gun and a missile launcher, that they planned to smuggle to insurgents in Iraq. I wouldn t be surprised if there were many more than that,  said Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.  And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States; and quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me. The committee s report found that the administration s refugee resettlement program proposal will have  a limited impact on alleviating the overall crisis but could have serious ramifications for U.S. homeland security. Jeh Johnson, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, admitted in October at a hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee that organizations such as the Islamic State might attempt to exploit the Syrian refugee resettlement program. It is true that we are not going to know a whole lot about the Syrians that come forth in this process,  he said.President Obama s refugee resettlement program is now under scrutiny after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris killed more than 120 people and left more than 300 injured on Friday.

23049,Obama Commuted Manning’s Sentence,"21st Century Wire says In yet another interesting end of term move, Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence. He is now scheduled to be released in May of 2017 rather than 2045. Is this a power play against Trump? A potential  call of bluff  to Julian Assange, who s said he would turn himself over to the US courts if Obama frees Manning?Adam Garrie of The Duran brings some interesting analysis to the table in the article below. Adam Garrie The DuranWith less than three days left until he leaves office, Barack Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence. Manning was to be released in 2045 but will now be released in May of this year.This surprise move is not the morally courageous move that it may appear to be. Obama, content to leave office sans dignity is clearly making a challenge to Julian Assange who recently challenged Obama to pardon Manning in return for Assange voluntarily traveling to the US to face what some would call justice, but anyone would a brain would call a show trial.Although I am personally happy that Manning will be released early (why the delay though), my sincere advice to Julian Assange is to do the following:With Donald Trump in power it may be possible to strike some sort of bargain whereby Assange can receive safe passage to Ecuador or any other country willing and able to grant him unconditional asylum. This would have to be guaranteed by President Trump.If Assange fights this battle from within the United States, elements of the deep state or worse yet, rogue agents working on behalf of the deep state or anti-Assange political interests, could take matters into their own hands.In another kick of the political football, Obama has now put yet another problem on Donald Trump s White House doorstep what to do if Assange makes good on his promise?The best thing that could possibly happen is for Assange to negotiate safe-passage out of Britain, brokered by a Trump administration. If anyone thinks the absurd charges in Sweden could impact this, they do not realise who has pulled the strings all along in this matter.If my suggestion is brought on board, Trump can tell his pro-Assange grassroots supporters (think Ron Paul followers and Infowars listeners) that he did the right thing regarding Assange. At the same time, he will be able to tell his deep state and Congressional opponents that he acted pragmatically rather than ethically in order to  move on  from the  Assange problem  instead of dragging out in a kangaroo court. Absurd though it is, some American politicians would sooner praise a pragmatic decision vis- -vis an ethical one.In any case, Manning won t be free until May of this year and a lot can happen Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US NewsSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 17, 2017",century wire end term move sentence power play trump call bluff analysis table article days office sentence manning year surprise move move content office sans dignity challenge manning return justice anyone brain show trial delay advice trump power sort bargain passage country asylum president trump battle state behalf state kick football problem trump house doorstep promise thing passage trump administration anyone absurd matter suggestion board trump thing time state order problem court decision case year lot report news century wire member
10914,"CLASS ACT: Watch Betsy DeVos Respond While Students At Black College Yell, Heckle, Turn Backs On Her During Commencement Speech [VIDEO]","Betsy DeVos just proved to America why President Trump chose her among so many qualified candidates to reform our broken education system. Full-grown men would have crumbled under the kind of pressure and hate she was facing during her graceful commencement speech. Let s face it, most of us would have walked off the stage, but Betsy DeVos, firm in her resolution to deliver the speech she was invited to share, stood at the podium, and against all odds, addressed an angry group of students railing against  the injustice  at a college where 95% of the students receive some form of state or federal grant money.During the roughly 25-minute speech, DeVos took time to address the criticism that s come her way since she was unveiled as the university s graduation speaker, telling the crowd it was important to converse with and learn from people despite disagreements.The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,  DeVos said.  But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak   with humility   to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don t immediately or instinctively agree,  she continued.While DeVos spoke, the students continued to heckle and yell over DeVos as she persevered through her speech. The University president who was clearly embarrassed by the behavior of the graduates finally stepped up to the microphone to address the students in hopes of getting the disrespectful group under control telling them,  If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you wanna go.  He then implored the students to be seated.The students chose to continue with their embarrassing behavior, at which time DeVos began to once again address the crowd:Many Bethune-Cookman University students, alumni and supporters made their disapproval of DeVos  appearance known well before she took the stage.On Tuesday, Bethune-Cookman University students and alumni delivered thousands of signatures to the school s president, Edison O. Jackson, and the university s Board of Trustees in a last-ditch effort to try and change their minds about inviting DeVos to speak.DeVos, a West Michigan native, initially drew ire from students and supporters from historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, throughout the country after she connected HBCUs to the school choice movement in February. MLiveDeVos recently met with presidents and chancellors of historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, at the White House. Following that meeting, she said in a statement that a key priority for the administration was to help develop opportunities for underserved communities, and praised HBCUs for fulfilling that mission all along. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,  she said in the statement.  They saw that the system wasn t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. DeVos continued:  HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Critics were quick to point out on social media that HBCUs were initially founded in part because black students often did not have the option to enroll in existing public institutions in the South.Others noted public HBCUs were generally not offered the same amount of funding and resources predominantly white colleges and universities received.In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education about the controversy, Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough said similar comments she made in the listening session  didn t come across as ill-spirited,  but was a poor analogy. I think she was honestly trying to find a way to connect her experience with HBCUs,  he told The Chronicle of Higher Education.

3785, Advocate For Legal Rape Says Trump’s Victory Makes It Acceptable For Men To Rape Women,"Daryush Valizadeh is a sexist and misogynist who is lobbying to make rape legal on private property, and he is a fan of Donald Trump.Trump s past statements and behavior towards women has emboldened men who think women are inferior and can do with them as they please.And Valizadeh wrote a manifesto celebrating Trump s win as the  moment  legal rape activists have been waiting for to make their goal a reality.I m in a state of exuberance that we now have a President who rates women on a 1-10 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. We may have to institute a new feature called  Would Trump bang?  to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. Simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the  beauty at every size  sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes. The President of the United States does not see the value in fat women who don t take care of themselves, and neither should you. We now have a President who will not encourage anti-male propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. While I do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist-minded daughter, Ivanka, Trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of Obama. Because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long-term manipulation, it is more than enough for Trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. Stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.We ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven t had a chance to understand what s going on and adapt. Instead, we ve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether it s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. Trump s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm s way.This jackass went on to brag that men like him will be able to say what they want to do what they want to women and get away it whether Trump changes the laws or not, suggesting that men can go right ahead and rape all the women they want without consequence.This is our moment. The door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we don t need to wait for Trump to do anything. His victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. It would be icing on the cake if Trump rolled back anti-masculine laws and policies, but it s not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands.This creepy asshole literally believes Donald Trump s election victory is one step closer toward making it legal for men to rape women.Across the country, Trump supporters have already committed over 300 hate crimes, including crimes against women such as assault.If Valizadeh has his way, we are about to see sexual assault crimes skyrocket, which means America just became an even more dangerous place for women because of Trump s victory.Featured Image: WomanSurvival.com",News,"November 16, 2016",misogynist property fan trump trump towards men manifesto trump win moment rape goal reality state exuberance president scale way appearance attitude feature bang importance beauty effort class sloth vulgarity wife men beauty size sewage gender market product president value care president propaganda rape culture victimhood influence feminist daughter trump attack men revolution result term manipulation trump gender issue culture order stop rot biology decade chance blow loss witch rape culture horror hookup incarceration trump victory room men harm way jackass men trump men consequence moment door renaissance masculinity men pride men part need trump anything victory strength bull closet cake trump masculine power country creepy trump election victory step men country trump assault way assault place trump victory image
15277,CALIFORNIA PIZZA SHOP GETS REAL LIFE LESSON IN ECONOMICS AFTER SELLING “LIVING WAGE PIZZA”,"The bad news for these bleeding heart liberals is there are even more reasonably priced pizza shop options who understand economics and reality Image via Lanesplitter Pizza and Subs Facebook pageLiberals love the idea of the minimum wage and a  living wage at least until it hits their bottom line.Lanesplitter Pizza & Pub in Emeryville, California is learning that economics lesson the hard way.Cities up and down California have been considering hiking up their minimum wage so Vic Gumper, the owner of Lanesplitter, decided to get ahead of the curve and do it on his own.Rather than just raise the minimum wage for his employees, he decided to do it in the form of creating a  living wage pizza. This business model means that all workers now earn $15 to $25 an hour as part of an experimental business model that also did away with gratuities and raised prices, making meals at all five locations  sustainably served, really   no tips necessary,  the Los Angeles Times reported. This movement, it s going on everywhere,  Gumper told the paper.  We just decided to manage the situation and get to a place where we can sustain it. Image via Lanesplitter Pizza and Subs Facebook pageBut while patrons have applauded the move verbally, they haven t put their money where their mouth is.The  living wage pizza  costs more than $30 and people haven t been too keen on paying for it.Gumper has seen a 25% drop in sales since April and has had to eliminate lunch hours at a few of his locations, according to the L.A. Times. The necessity of paying people a living wage in the Bay Area is clear, so it s hard to argue against it, and it s something I m really proud to be able to try doing,  he said.  At the same time, I m terrified of going out of business after 18 years.

8556, Florida Governor Rick Scott Tax Cut His Way Into Massive HIV/AIDS Comeback,"Rick Scott has been governor of Florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. While the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of HIV and the number of people dying from AIDS drops, Florida is seeing the reverse.In a comprehensive review of how Scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the Miami Herald discovered two disturbing facts: Florida now leads the nation in HIV cases, and its biggest county, Miami-Dade, is ground zero.New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.Although Florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year Scott took office. It s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.  We have a rise in AIDS and we have a reduction in public health spending. We re now cutting just to be cutting. Indeed, Scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. He s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).However, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. At least Brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. In a disturbing reminder of the Reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the AIDS epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, Scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in HIV cases. Or perhaps he s just grown used to it. After his first year in office, the number of HIV cases has grown hand-over-fist.Making matters worse, Scott has routinely fought against working with Obamacare in his state. For years. All the while, HIV cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. This spells disasters for the victims of HIV because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier AIDS illness is careful health management. You can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the President.As we ve seen around the country, Republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. Far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  It s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.Florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  Oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 24, 2016",rick governor term state effects fanaticism rest country spread number people reverse review war government health herald nation county dade year dade account percent nation year state work force quarter department health county health state health agency year office neglect administration board rise reduction health spending movement standard tax vein brownback state economy governor rick neglect city tax impact brownback decency state job growth reminder era surge year office number hand fist state budget way illness health management governor access health insurance president country tyranny government disaster freedom life liberty determination government misery concept government way government spending oftentimes illness poverty feature image gage

(Is she talking about Antifa and basement dwellers who are collecting a paycheck from various George Soros groups for occasionally rolling out of bed, grabbing a face-mask and a baseball bat from their father s garage and going out to threaten the free-speech of Trump supporters?)Maher reminded her,  They may be all energized but they don t have a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator or a Democratic parliament. The first 5 minutes of Warren s yawn-inducing interview is filled with whining about how her progressive agenda is being ignored and how capitalism needs to be addressed and taken down.Maher quickly reminds her that from 1980-2015 when many of the economy-killing regulations were implemented that many Democrats were responsible for passing.

21198,WHO NEEDS DEMOCRATS? GOP Consultant Says Establishment Needs To “Put a bullet” In Trump’s Head,"No wonder we ve had the worst Democrat President in the history of the United States for 7 long years!GOP Consultant Rick Wilson says GOP establishment needs to  put a bullet  in Trump s head.Wilson has also hurled insults at Trump supporters the past few months.Breitbart reported: On Tuesday evening, establishment Republican consultant Rick Wilson said the GOP establishment donor class must find a way to  put a bullet  in GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.In an interview with MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Wilson conceded that  Trump is still a very powerful force right now  because he appeals to part of the of the conservative base that Wilson said was activated by his  nativist  message. Wilson insisted that the donor class  can t just sit back on the sidelines and say,  oh well, don t worry, this will all work itself out. They re still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump,  Wilson said.  And that s a fact. Republican establishment figures who have underestimated Trump since he entered the race are reportedly looking to raise millions to try to derail Trump and knock him out of the race. Wilson added that the Republican establishment must figure out a way to find a candidate who can successfully  post up  against Hillary Clinton because  neither Donald Trump or Ben Carson is ready to go up against the Clinton machine. Wilson claimed that Trump and Carson are  obviously not ready for primetime. During a September CNN interview, Wilson told Erin Burnett that Trump could  eat a live baby on television  and Trump s supporters  would think it s the greatest thing in America.  He has also demeaned Trump s supporters as  low-information  rubes and has likened them to  post-rational  conspiracy theorists.In an interview with CNN s Don Lemon, Wilson said Trump s message  doesn t have to make sense  for his supporters to back him and compared Trump to someone who is a conspiracy theorist like  your cranky uncle at Thanksgiving  who always has a theory about the Bilderbergers or the World Bank, or the IMF, or the Trilateral Commission.

11979,"OBAMA’S Mexico Gun-Running, Race-Baiting, Former Attorney General Hired By State Of CA To Help Fight Against Trump","Eric Holder was embroiled in some sort of controversy for most of the time he served as Obama s choice for Attorney General. He was the key figure in the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal with Mexico, and was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations. Holder also was instrumental in fanning the flames of the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos. California lawmakers already are preparing for a legal brawl with the Donald Trump administration   and they ve got President Obama s former top attorney in their corner.Top state Democratic lawmakers announced Wednesday that former Attorney General Eric Holder has been tapped as outside counsel to advise the Legislature on potential challenges with the Trump government. He will lead a team from the Covington & Burling law firm, where he s been working since leaving the Obama administration in 2015. With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,  California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement.  This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great. They said Holder and his team will advise  in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made. The statement did not specify which policies they anticipate will cause friction, though California s numerous sanctuary cities are likely to face challenges from an administration that has threatened to pull their federal funding.   FOX NewsSets forth articles of impeachment stating that Holder: (1) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); (2) failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (3) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors; and (4) testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee in a letter dated June 19, 2013, that he approved of a search warrant on journalist James Rosen. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, De Le n suggested Holder s team will work on issues like immigration, climate change, the environment and voting rights. The unorthodox arrangement assigns to Holder s team some duties that normally would be handled by the state s top law enforcement official, the California attorney general. Gov. Jerry Brown has nominated Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra for that job.Holder was one of Obama s longest-serving and most controversial Cabinet members.He had a contentious relationship with congressional Republicans, who in 2012 voted to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal.

5169, WATCH: Seth Meyers Hilariously Reviews Trump’s Very Bad Week,"Donald Trump has had a terrible week, so Seth Meyers piled on with a load of humiliation and mockery.Republicans are starting to back away from Donald Trump, but not because he s a racist and a misogynist. They re okay with that. Republicans are mad because their nominee has refused to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan in the tough primary race he faces in Wisconsin.During his show on Thursday night, Seth Meyers had a field day with Trump s disastrous week. This is the final straw?  Meyers asked.  Not the racism or the misogyny or the wall? Yep, that s certainly what it looks like. And even some of Trump s most ardent supporters are starting to criticize him.Newt Gingrich was on Trump s shortlist to be the vice-presidential nominee and he compared Trump to a great quarterback who throws a bunch of interceptions in a game.But Meyers corrected him: Actually, it s more like watching a quarterback throw an interception, blame the interception on Mexicans, insult the coach s mother and then storm off the field bitching that the game is rigged. Mike Huckabee, who had no problem setting aside his  Christian  morals to defend Trump, a man who has none, defended Trump s meltdown by insisting that he will be surrounded by the best people if he is put the White House even though Trump hasn t exactly done that during his campaign or at the convention, where most Republican shunned Trump and he ended up bringing has-beens like Scott Baio to Cleveland.Well, Seth Myers had a response to that as well. Dudes, chill out   he ll be way cooler and more reasonable just as soon as we give him more power,  Meyers sarcastically said. You know, the same way drunk people always calm down once you give them back their car keys. And I m not sure it s all that comforting when the biggest promise you can make about your candidate is, he ll have adults around him and we ll lock him out of his Twitter account. That s how it works with Justin Bieber, and it barely works with him. But perhaps the biggest gaffe Trump made this week is when he kicked a mother and her baby out of a rally because the baby was crying.Trump appeared to show compassion and understanding at first, but then he quickly demonstrated his dislike of babies by asking for the mother and baby to be removed. That is a huge gaffe for a Republican, because the GOP platform does not allow you to change your mind about a baby,  Meyers quipped.Meyers then went on to mock Trump for being obsessed with starting a nuclear apocalypse and for already whining about how the election is allegedly already rigged against him.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the most powerful nation on the planet. He is joke and would be seen as a joke by the rest of the world. Republicans should be embarrassed and ashamed that they made Trump their nominee. The only way they can redeem themselves is by making sure Trump loses by a landslide on Election Day.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 5, 2016",trump week load humiliation mockery trump racist misogynist nominee house speaker primary race show night seth field day trump week straw racism misogyny wall yep trump vice nominee trump quarterback bunch game quarterback throw interception interception coach mother field game problem morals trump man none trump people house trump campaign convention trump response chill way cooler power way drunk people car promise candidate twitter account gaffe trump week mother baby rally baby trump compassion understanding dislike mother baby gaffe platform mind baby trump apocalypse election video trump president nation planet joke rest world nominee way trump landslide election day image capture

2463, Reince Priebus Backs Trump’s Claim That The Media Is ‘The Enemy’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has declared war on the free press and his chief of staff apparently has his back. Appearing on Face the Nation this Sunday, Reince Priebus defended the tweeter in chief when it comes to his feud with the media.Trump has proclaimed the press to be  the enemy of the American people,  (through his Twitter account, of course) and Priebus thinks we should take this  seriously,  but for all the wrong reasons. CBS host John Dickerson asked Priebus about Trump naming the media the enemy in his tweet and the response he got was probably not what he was expecting. Well, I think you should take it seriously,  Priebus said.  I think that the problem we ve got is that we re talking about bogus stories like the one in the New York Times, that we ve had constant contact with Russian officials. The next day, the Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing. Both stories grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown, and it s total garbage. The chief of staff continued, explaining that his biggest complaint about the media is their habit of protecting their sources and not outing them to the world. I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff,  Priebus said.  Put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren t willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn t be listed We re talking about stupidity and intelligence reporting that is based on facts that s not coming out of the actual heads of these intelligence agencies. And we re sitting here talking about it. And it s a shame. And it needs to end. Trump and his team are trying their best to convince the American people that the only place they can get the truth is from them. They are doing all they can to delegitimize the media and convince us that everything the press tells us is a lie. If the people don t trust the media, then there will be no one to bust them when the start spinning their  alternative facts  and this is precisely what the Trump administration wants.Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"February 19, 2017",trump war press chief staff face nation tweeter chief feud media trump press enemy people twitter account course host trump media enemy tweet response problem york times contact day wall street journal story community president intelligence garbage chief staff complaint media habit world media source stuff piece paper print people name quote quote stupidity intelligence intelligence shame trump team people place truth media everything press lie people trust media one start trump administration video image video screen capture
10157,HERE YOU GO! TRUMP CONDEMNS DAVID DUKE…Calls Him A “Bigot” and A “Racist” [Video],"Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Further proof that Trump is never afraid to call a spade a spade, or a racist a racist.Read more: The Gateway Pundit",politics,"Aug 13, 2017",situation trump people sides violence bigotry flurry frustration chaos duke trump bigotry violence fact trump bigotry interview trump duke reform party trump party nature people matter trump duke bigot racist problem people party proof trump spade spade racist racist read gateway pundit
3947, Former Classmate: Trump Smacked His Son So Hard It Knocked ‘Him To The Floor’,"We ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It s a life most of us can never imagine while we re paying our monthly bills. So what s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr. s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star s son wasn t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump s temperament, it might be exactly what you d imagine.On Facebook, Mekler told of the animosity Trump s son had for this father. I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr. s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,  he recalls.  There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said  put on a suit and meet me outside,  and closed the door,  Melker wrote. Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,  he continued.  He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was  Diaper Don,  because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people s beds and urinate.   I always felt terrible for him,  he continued.Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because  in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country. To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker s story is accurate or not, we re not sure, but given Trump s awful temper, it s difficult to discount it.Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty.",News,"November 4, 2016",home gold son suit front camera side life trump father classmate trump university reality show star son temperament told animosity trump son father dorm door room room trump son door baseball game glimpse estate magnate door jersey moment trump son face front word father face floor front suit door drunk college memory campus arm sling father attention name nickname tendency drunk people part reason light day trump temperament decency country trump son drinking problem college days story trump pool

16062,IT’S A MIRACLE! Food Stamp Use Went Down 85% After This Change In Requirements,"Food Stamp use has miraculously gone down in several states! It s a miracle! In 13 Alabama counties, food stamp use went down a whopping 85%!When Obama took out the welfare-to-work requirement, the use of food stamps skyrocketed to nearly 45 million Americans! That s 1 in every 7 US citizens using food stamps! Now that the Trump administration has vowed to reduce the use, it s interesting to see that people jump off of assistance when the work requirement is put back in.Georgia and Alabama have seen a sharp decrease in food stamp use with the work requirement back in:Georgia:More than half of the 11,779 people enrolled for food stamps in 21 counties, an estimated 7,251 people, have dropped out of the food stamp program a drop of 62 percent, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Georgia first rolled out its work requirements for the food stamp program in three counties in January 2016. Since then, the state has expanded work requirements in an additional 21 counties, giving people in those 21 counties until April 1, 2017 to find a job or lose food stamp benefits. Via: BNALABAMA:Thirteen previously exempted Alabama counties saw an 85 percent drop in food stamp participation after work requirements were put in place on Jan. 1, according to the Alabama Department of Human Resources.The counties   Greene, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Lowndes, Wilcox, Monroe, Conecuh, Clarke, Washington, Choctaw, Sumter and Barbour   had been exempt from a change that limited able-bodied adults without dependents to three months of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits within a three-year time frame unless they were working or participating in an approved training program.During the economic downturn of 2011-2013, several states   including Alabama   waived the SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment. It was reinstituted for 54 counties on Jan. 1, 2016 and for the remaining 13 on Jan. 1, 2017. As of April 2017, the highest jobless rate among the 13 previously excluded counties was in Wilcox County, which reported a state-high unemployment rate of 11.7 percent, down more than 11 percentage points from the county s jobless rate for the same month of 2011.Ending the exemption has dramatically cut the number of SNAP recipients in the counties.As of Jan. 1, 2017, there were 13,663 able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps statewide. That number dropped to 7,483 by May 1, 2017. Among the 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18-50 without dependents receiving food stamps as of Jan. 1, 2017. That number dropped to 831   a decline of about 85 percent   by May 1, 2017. Based on the trend, the number of (able-bodied adults without dependents) recipients for SNAP benefits is expected to continue to decline statewide and in the formerly 13 exempted counties,  according to Alabama DHR spokesperson John Hardy.Statewide, the number of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps has fallen by almost 35,000 people since Jan. 1, 2016. Each recipient receives about $126 a month in benefits.Nationwide, there are about 44 million people receiving SNAP benefits at a cost of about $71 billion. The Trump administration has vowed to cut the food stamp rolls over the next decade, including ensuring that able-bodied adults recipients are working.Via: al.com",Government News,"Jun 6, 2017",food stamp use miracle food stamp use welfare requirement use food food trump administration use people assistance work requirement decrease food stamp use work requirement half people food people food stamp program drop percent journal constitution work food stamp program state work people job food stamp thirteen percent drop food stamp participation work place department perry change nutrition assistance program year time frame training program downturn snap work response unemployment rate county state unemployment rate percent percentage county rate month exemption number food number food number decline percent trend number number food people recipient month people cost trump administration food stamp decade al
8850, This Homeless Veteran Receives A Gift From A Child He’ll Never Forget (VIDEO),"Most of us don t know what it s like to be homeless, but three brothers decided to let all of us know with a video that has gone viral. As a homeless man sat in the streets of New York asking for money for food, the youngest brother Omar sat next to him and pretended to be homeless.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvoWBbYxdwc]As people passed by, it was young Omar who who was getting money in his cup while the homeless veteran received nothing. At one point, after a policewoman put money in Omar s cup, the veteran asked her for money, saying that he had nothing to eat the entire day. Annoyed, the policewoman sternly said that she works every day and that he s a grown man and then flicked his hat.Another passerby was even more abusive. After he gave Omar some money, the veteran asked for some change to which the man said,  This little kid out here. They don t know what it takes. You re a grown ass man. I got a job. I work my ass off every day.  The veteran replied,  I served my country sir.  The man then said,  You served your country! Here is something that served your country!  He then spilled the food he was carrying all over the veteran.Yet, despite being humiliated and crying, the veteran stood up, walked a few feet to a restaurant, and came back with two slices of pizza, one for him and for Omar.That s when the two brothers of Omar came up to the veteran and told him that Omar was not homeless. They gave him all of the money Omar had collected and an additional $200. Surprised and crying, the veteran and the brothers exchanged hugs.We don t know why this man who served his country is homeless, but war is damaging both physically and psychologically. What we do know is that he was extremely kind hearted to Omar despite the humiliation he suffered at the hands of strangers.One thing that we should learn from this video is that we need to take care of our veterans.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 10, 2016",video homeless man streets york money food brother watch people money cup homeless veteran nothing point policewoman money veteran money nothing day policewoman day man hat money veteran change man ass man job ass day veteran country man country something country food veteran veteran restaurant pizza veteran money veteran man country war kind humiliation thing video care image

6951, Poverty Kills As The Rich Live Longer Than Ever (INFOGRAPHIC),"The Republican war on poor people has been killing Americans and now we have the proof. A study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows clearly that poverty compounded by Republican refusal to spend money on the poor is unnecessarily shortening the lives of millions of people. We know that it s unnecessary because in the parts of the country where the poor are not treated like animals, they live longer.It s so bad that in some of the poorer parts of America, people have a life expectancy on par with developing African nations:The poor in some cities   big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.   live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.Meanwhile, the rich continue to live longer because in America, even longevity is for sale to the highest bidder: the gap in life spans between rich and poor widened from 2001 to 2014. The top 1 percent in income among American men live 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women, the gap is 10 years. These rich Americans have gained three years of longevity just in this century. They live longer almost without regard to where they live.Here s the map put together by the New York Times color coded for average lifespan. Notice that most of the low-end life expectancy is located squarely in Republican controlled states:This is a direct result of Republicans refusing to lift a finger to help those most in need. Between refusing to expand Medicaid, savage cuts to food stamps and a general attitude of  die quickly,  conservative politics are killing people with their greed and inhumanity.But it s more than just a lack of access to doctors that is killing the poor. By denying them any kind of economic help, the poor are forced to eat junk food because that s all they can afford. By denying them a proper education and job opportunities, the poor are highly stressed, already bad for your health, and have been turning to drugs and alcohol to cope:Life expectancy for the poor is lowest in a large swath that cuts through the middle of the country, and it appears in pockets in the rest of the country, in places like Nevada. David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist and an author of the paper, calls it the  drug overdose belt,  because the area matches in part a map of where the nation s opioid epidemic is concentrated.The good news/bad news is that in the places where the poor are not treated like lepers, they love much longer and healthier lives. Birmingham, Alabama took numerous measures to improve the public s health and, shockingly, it helped:In the area in and around Birmingham, Ala., the life span for adults in the bottom quarter of income rose 3.8 years for men and 2.2 years for women from 2001 to 2014.Clearly, they must have used the big government to tell you what size soda to drink, right? Well, not so much:The county expanded availability of preventive health care like vaccinations and mammograms by opening clinics in poorer neighborhoods in the 1990s and early 2000s (though recently it has closed some of the clinics). Although a relatively high percentage of the population lacks health insurance, a portion of local taxes goes to hospital care for those who cannot pay. The county has been ahead of the rest of Alabama in banning smoking in restaurants and workplaces, with a law enacted in 2012. And philanthropic foundations backed by old industrial money have funded campaigns to make people healthier in the Birmingham area.If the Republican-controlled legislature of Alabama had expanded Medicaid instead of throwing a temper tantrum, these measures would be even MORE effective. Still, Birmingham proves that even with a state government dedicated to hurting the poor, local governments can, and do, still mitigate much of the damage.The bottom line here is that while the rich reap the benefits of better doctors, less stress and access to healthy foods, the poor in large swathes of the country are denied the same, mostly by the rich and their puppets in the Republican Party. The net result is that millions of people are dying before their time so a small group of people can amass more wealth and power. Sadly, this drive to succeed at the expense of others is the new American Dream.The only silver lining here is that many of those same poor people have finally, finally figured out that Republicans are not going to help them. Sure, they turned to Donald Trump for leadership but even after he s gone, they ll remember who s been stabbing them in the back for decades. They may never embrace the Democrats but maybe, just maybe, they ll start demanding Republicans stop catering to the rich while throwing the poor the crumbs.We can only hope.Featured image via NY Times",News,"April 12, 2016",war people proof study week journal association poverty refusal money millions people country people life expectancy par york class life expectancy century country average people life continue longevity sale bidder gap life percent income men percent gap longevity century regard map york times notice end life expectancy result finger need savage food attitude politics people greed inhumanity lack access kind help junk food education job health alcohol life expectancy swath middle country rest country cutler economist author paper drug belt area part map nation epidemic news news health area life span quarter income men government size soda county availability health care percentage population health insurance portion care county rest smoking law money people area legislature temper tantrum state government damage line access country party result millions people time group people wealth power drive expense dream silver lining people trump leadership back image times

6396, WATCH: Trump Lashes Out After Being Grilled To His Breaking Point By ABC Host,"George Stephanopoulos allowed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to phone into Good Morning America on Friday morning only to be grilled for not releasing his tax returns. Do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision?  Stephanopoulos asked. I don t think they do,  Trump replied before claiming that he will  gladly  release his returns once the IRS completes an audit against him. Of course, the audit may not be over until after the election, a fact that even Trump conceded despite feigning hope that it will end before November.Stephanopoulos didn t buy that argument, however, pointing out that an audit didn t prevent former President Richard Nixon from releasing his tax returns. The IRS has made it very clear that an audit is not a bar to public release,  Stephanopoulos said.  It s entirely your choice. President Nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit and when you were seeking a casino license in Pennsylvania and New Jersey you released your returns to state officials even though you were under audit. Trump repeated that he will not release his returns until after the audit is complete, which may or may not be completed until after the election, so the audit is a rather convenient excuse for Trump.Trump then erroneously claimed that many presidents have not released their tax returns, and Stephanopoulos didn t let him get away it.  Every single nominee since 1976 has released his tax returns,  the ABC host informed Trump.Trump went on to claim that his release of his  financials  should be enough, but Stephanopoulos noted that such documents fail to show what his tax rate is and how much in taxes he pays.That really set Trump off as he began to complain about having to pay taxes and he admitted that he  tries very hard  to pay as little in taxes as possible. As we all know, the reason why Bernie Sanders has been so popular this election season is because one of his goals is to force the wealthy 1 percent to pay their fair share of taxes.Testiness on Trump s part dominated the remaining part of the interview as Trump repeated that he would not release his returns until the audit is complete and claimed that he shouldn t have to release his returns until Hillary Clinton releases nonexistent missing emails. When pressed further on his returns, Trump said curtly that it s  none of your business. Here s the video via YouTube.But it is Stephanopoulos s business because he is a journalist. It s also the American people s business because they deserve all the information before going to the polls in November. Trump can claim all he wants that he doesn t have secret overseas accounts or that he pays low taxes, but the American people won t know if he s lying or not until he releases the returns to the public. And since Trump is playing this game of hide and seek with his returns, the only conclusion we can assume at this time is that he has something to hide and he is doing everything he can to keep it hidden until after the election.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 13, 2016",nominee trump phone morning morning tax right tax decision audit course audit election fact hope argument audit president tax audit bar release choice president tax audit casino license jersey state audit trump audit election audit convenient excuse trump trump tax nominee tax host trump trump release tax rate trump reason sanders election season percent share testiness trump part part interview trump audit trump none business video business journalist people business information trump people public trump game hide seek conclusion time something everything election image capture
17404,UPDATED VIDEO: IS THIS AMERICA? CONSERVATIVES And Their Families Experience SHOCKING ABUSE And SHAMING In Their Homes Ordered By Leftist DA As Part Of Insane Vendetta,"This story should send chills down the spine of every American. Communism is on our doorstep THEY CAME WITH A BATTERING RAM. Cindy Archer, one of the lead architects of Wisconsin s Act 10   also called the  Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill,  it limited public-employee benefits and altered collective-bargaining rules for public-employee unions   was jolted awake by yelling, loud pounding at the door, and her dogs  frantic barking. The entire house   the windows and walls   was shaking.She looked outside to see up to a dozen police officers, yelling to open the door. They were carrying a battering ram. She wasn t dressed, but she started to run toward the door, her body in full view of the police. Some yelled at her to grab some clothes, others yelled for her to open the door. I was so afraid,  she says.  I did not know what to do.  She grabbed some clothes, opened the door, and dressed right in front of the police. The dogs were still frantic. I begged and begged,  Please don t shoot my dogs, please don t shoot my dogs, just don t shoot my dogs.  I couldn t get them to stop barking, and I couldn t get them outside quick enough. I saw a gun and barking dogs. I was scared and knew this was a bad mix.  She got the dogs safely out of the house, just as multiple armed agents rushed inside.Some even barged into the bathroom, where her partner was in the shower. The officer or agent in charge demanded that Cindy sit on the couch, but she wanted to get up and get a cup of coffee.  I told him this was my house and I could do what I wanted.  Wrong thing to say.  This made the agent in charge furious. He towered over me with his finger in my face and yelled like a drill sergeant that I either do it his way or he would handcuff me. They wouldn t let her speak to a lawyer.She looked outside and saw a person who appeared to be a reporter. Someone had tipped him off. The neighbors started to come outside, curious at the commotion, and all the while the police searched her house, making a mess, and   according to Cindy   leaving her  dead mother s belongings strewn across the basement floor in a most disrespectful way. Then they left, carrying with them only a cellphone and a laptop.Here is a videotaped interview of a neighbor who witnessed the police invasion of her home: IT S A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.  That was the first thought of  Anne  (not her real name).Someone was pounding at her front door. It was early in the morning   very early   and it was the kind of heavy pounding that meant someone was either fleeing from   or bringing   trouble.  It was so hard. I d never heard anything like it. I thought someone was dying outside. She ran to the door, opened it, and then chaos.  People came pouring in. For a second I thought it was a home invasion. It was terrifying. They were yelling and running, into every room in the house. One of the men was in my face, yelling at me over and over and over. It was indeed a home invasion, but the people who were pouring in were Wisconsin law-enforcement officers. Armed, uniformed police swarmed into the house. Plainclothes investigators cornered her and her newly awakened family.Soon, state officials were seizing the family s personal property, including each person s computer and smartphone, filled with the most intimate family information.Why were the police at Anne s home? She had no answers. The police were treating them the way they d seen police treat drug dealers on television. In fact, TV or movies were their only points of reference, because they weren t criminals. They were law-abiding. They didn t buy or sell drugs. They weren t violent. They weren t a danger to anyone. Yet there were cops   surrounding their house on the outside, swarming the house on the inside.They even taunted the family as if they were mere  perps. As if the home invasion, the appropriation of private property, and the verbal abuse weren t enough, next came ominous warnings.Don t call your lawyer. Don t tell anyone about this raid. Not even your mother, your father, or your closest friends.The entire neighborhood could see the police around their house, but they had to remain silent. This was not the  right to remain silent  as uttered by every cop on every legal drama on television   the right against self-incrimination.They couldn t mount a public defense if they wanted   or even offer an explanation to family and friends. Yet no one in this family was a  perp. Instead, like Cindy, they were American citizens guilty of nothing more than exercising their First Amendment rights to support Act 10 and other conservative causes in Wisconsin. Sitting there shocked and terrified, this citizen   who is still too intimidated to speak on the record   kept thinking,  Is this America? THEY FOLLOWED ME TO MY KIDS  ROOMS.  For the family of  Rachel  (not her real name), the ordeal began before dawn   with the same loud, insistent knocking. Still in her pajamas, Rachel answered the door and saw uniformed police, poised to enter her home.When Rachel asked to wake her children herself, the officer insisted on walking into their rooms. The kids woke to an armed officer, standing near their beds. The entire family was herded into one room, and there they watched as the police carried off their personal possessions, including items that had nothing to do with the subject of the search warrant   even her daughter s computer.And, yes, there were the warnings. Don t call your lawyer. Don t talk to anyone about this. Don t tell your friends.The kids watched   alarmed   as the school bus drove by, with the students inside watching the spectacle of uniformed police surrounding the house, carrying out the family s belongings. Yet they were told they couldn t tell anyone at school. They, too, had to remain silent.The mom watched as her entire life was laid open before the police. Her professional files, her personal files, everything. She knew this was all politics. She knew a rogue prosecutor was targeting her for her political beliefs. And she realized,  Every aspect of my life is in their hands. And they hate me. Fortunately for her family, the police didn t taunt her or her children. Some of them seemed embarrassed by what they were doing. At the end of the ordeal, one officer looked at the family, still confined to one room, and said,  Some days, I hate my job. For dozens of conservatives, the years since Scott Walker s first election as governor of Wisconsin transformed the state   known for pro-football championships, good cheese, and a population with a reputation for being unfailingly polite   into a place where conservatives have faced early-morning raids, multi-year secretive criminal investigations, slanderous and selective leaks to sympathetic media, and intrusive electronic snooping.Yes, Wisconsin, the cradle of the progressive movement and home of the  Wisconsin idea    the marriage of state governments and state universities to govern through technocratic reform   was giving birth to a new progressive idea, the use of law enforcement as a political instrument, as a weapon to attempt to undo election results, shame opponents, and ruin lives.Most Americans have never heard of these raids, or of the lengthy criminal investigations of Wisconsin conservatives. For good reason. Bound by comprehensive secrecy orders, conservatives were left to suffer in silence as leaks ruined their reputations, as neighbors, looking through windows and dismayed at the massive police presence, the lights shining down on targets  homes, wondered, no doubt, What on earth did that family do?This was the on-the-ground reality of the so-called John Doe investigations, expansive and secret criminal proceedings that directly targeted Wisconsin residents because of their relationship to Scott Walker, their support for Act 10, and their advocacy of conservative reform.Largely hidden from the public eye, this traumatic process, however, is now heading toward a legal climax, with two key rulings expected in the late spring or early summer.The first ruling, from the Wisconsin supreme court, could halt the investigations for good, in part by declaring that the  misconduct  being investigated isn t misconduct at all but the simple exercise of First Amendment rights.The second ruling, from the United States Supreme Court, could grant review on a federal lawsuit brought by Wisconsin political activist Eric O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth, the first conservatives to challenge the investigations head-on.If the Court grants review, it could not only halt the investigations but also begin the process of holding accountable those public officials who have so abused their powers.But no matter the outcome of these court hearings, the damage has been done. In the words of Mr. O Keefe,  The process is the punishment. UPDATED VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BLAZE TV s DANA LOESCH:It all began innocently enough. In 2009, officials from the office of the Milwaukee County executive contacted the office of the Milwaukee district attorney, headed by John Chisholm, to investigate the disappearance of $11,242.24 from the Milwaukee chapter of the Order of the Purple Heart.The matter was routine, with witnesses willing and able to testify against the principal suspect, a man named Kevin Kavanaugh.What followed, however, was anything but routine. Chisholm failed to act promptly on the report, and when he did act, he refused to conduct a conventional criminal investigation but instead petitioned, in May 2010, to open a  John Doe  investigation, a proceeding under Wisconsin law that permits Wisconsin officials to conduct extensive investigations while keeping the target s identity secret (hence the designation  John Doe ).John Doe investigations alter typical criminal procedure in two important ways: First, they remove grand juries from the investigative process, replacing the ordinary citizens of a grand jury with a supervising judge.Second, they can include strict secrecy requirements not just on the prosecution but also on the targets of the investigation. In practice, this means that, while the prosecution cannot make public comments about the investigation, it can take public actions indicating criminal suspicion (such as raiding businesses and homes in full view of the community) while preventing the targets of the raids from defending against or even discussing the prosecution s claims.Why would Chisholm seek such broad powers to investigate a year-old embezzlement claim with a known suspect? Because the Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker, had by that time become the leading Republican candidate for governor. District Attorney Chisholm was a Democrat, a very partisan Democrat.Almost immediately after opening the John Doe investigation, Chisholm used his expansive powers to embarrass Walker, raiding his county-executive offices within a week.As Mr. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth explained in court filings, the investigation then dramatically expanded: Over the next few months, [Chisholm s] investigation of all-things-Walker expanded to include everything from alleged campaign-finance violations to sexual misconduct to alleged public contracting bid-rigging to alleged misuse of county time and property.Between May 5, 2010, and May 3, 2012, the Milwaukee Defendants filed at least eighteen petitions to formally  [e]nlarge  the scope of the John Doe investigation, and each was granted. . .That amounts to a new formal inquiry every five and a half weeks, on average, for two years.This expansion coincided with one of the more remarkable state-level political controversies in modern American history   the protest (and passage) of Act 10, followed by the attempted recall of a number of Wisconsin legislators and, ultimately, Governor Walker.Political observers will no doubt remember the events in Madison   the state capitol overrun by chanting protesters, Democratic lawmakers fleeing the state to prevent votes on the legislation, and tens of millions of dollars of outside money flowing into the state as Wisconsin became, fundamentally, a proxy fight pitting the union-led Left against the Tea Party led economic Right.At the same time that the public protests were raging, so were private   but important   protests in the Chisholm home and workplace.As a former prosecutor told journalist Stuart Taylor, Chisholm s wife was a teachers -union shop steward who was distraught over Act 10 s union reforms. He said Chisholm  felt it was his personal duty  to stop them. Meanwhile, according to this whistleblower, the district attorney s offices were festooned with the  blue fist  poster of the labor-union movement, indicating that Chisholm s employees were very much invested in the political fight.In the end, the John Doe proceeding failed in its ultimate aims. It secured convictions for embezzlement (related to the original 2009 complaint), a conviction for sexual misconduct, and a few convictions for minor campaign violations, but Governor Walker was untouched, his reforms were implemented, and he survived his recall election. But with another election looming   this time Walker s campaign for reelection   Chisholm wasn t finished.He launched yet another John Doe investigation,  supervised  by Judge Barbara Kluka. Kluka proved to be capable of superhuman efficiency   approving  every petition, subpoena, and search warrant in the case  in a total of one day s work.If the first series of John Doe investigations was  everything Walker,  the second series was  everything conservative,  as Chisholm had launched an investigation of not only Walker (again) but the Wisconsin Club for Growth and dozens of other conservative organizations, this time fishing for evidence of allegedly illegal  coordination  between conservative groups and the Walker campaign.In the second John Doe, Chisholm had no real evidence of wrongdoing. Yes, conservative groups were active in issue advocacy, but issue advocacy was protected by the First Amendment and did not violate relevant campaign laws.Nonetheless, Chisholm persuaded prosecutors in four other counties to launch their own John Does, with Judge Kluka overseeing all of them.Empowered by a rubber-stamp judge, partisan investigators ran amok. They subpoenaed and obtained (without the conservative targets  knowledge) massive amounts of electronic data, including virtually all the targets  personal e-mails and other electronic messages from outside e-mail vendors and communications companies.The investigations exploded into the open with a coordinated series of raids on October 3, 2013. These were home invasions, including those described above. Chisholm s office refused to comment on the raid tactics (or any other aspect of the John Doe investigations), but witness accounts regarding the two John Doe investigations are remarkably similar: early-morning intrusions, police rushing through the house, and stern commands to remain silent and tell no one about what had occurred.At the same time, the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative organizations received broad subpoenas requiring them to turn over virtually all business records, including  donor information, correspondence with their associates, and all financial information.  The subpoenas also contained dire warnings about disclosure of their existence, threatening contempt of court if the targets spoke publicly.For select conservative families across five counties, this was the terrifying moment   the moment they felt at the mercy of a truly malevolent state.Speaking both on and off the record, targets reflected on how many layers of Wisconsin government failed their fundamental constitutional duties   the prosecutors who launched the rogue investigations, the judge who gave the abuse judicial sanction, investigators who chose to taunt and intimidate during the raids, and those police who ultimately approved and executed aggressive search tactics on law-abiding, peaceful citizens.For some of the families, the trauma of the raids, combined with the stress and anxiety of lengthy criminal investigations, has led to serious emotional repercussions.  Devastating  is how Anne describes the impact on her family.  Life-changing,  she says.  All in terrible ways. O Keefe, who has been in contact with multiple targeted families, says,  Every family I know of that endured a home raid has been shaken to its core, and the fate of marriages and families still hangs in the balance in some cases. Anne also describes a new fear of the police:  I used to support the police, to believe they were here to protect us. Now, when I see an officer, I ll cross the street. I m afraid of them. I know what they re capable of.  Cindy says,  I lock my doors and I close my shades. I don t answer the door unless I am expecting someone. My heart races when I see a police car sitting in front of my house or following me in the car.The raid was so public. I ve been harassed. My house has been vandalized. [She did not identify suspects.] I no longer feel safe, and I don t think I ever will. Rachel talks about the effect on her children.  I tried to create a home where the kids always feel safe. Now they know they re not. They know men with guns can come in their house, and there s nothing we can do.  Every knock on the door brings anxiety. Every call to the house is screened. In the back of her mind is a single, unsettling thought: These people will never stop.Victims of trauma   and every person I spoke with described the armed raids as traumatic   often need to talk, to share their experiences and seek solace in the company of a loving family and supportive friends. The investigators denied them that privilege, and it compounded their pain and fear. The investigation not only damaged families, it also shut down their free speech. In many cases, the investigations halted conservative groups in their tracks.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth described the effect in court filings: O Keefe s associates began cancelling meetings with him and declining to take his calls, reasonably fearful that merely associating with him could make them targets of the investigation.O Keefe was forced to abandon fundraising for the Club because he could no longer guarantee to donors that their identities would remain confidential, could not (due to the Secrecy Order) explain to potential donors the nature of the investigation, could not assuage donors  fears that they might become targets themselves, and could not assure donors that their money would go to fund advocacy rather than legal expenses.The Club was also paralyzed. Its officials could not associate with its key supporters, and its funds were depleted. It could not engage in issue advocacy for fear of criminal sanction.These raids and subpoenas were often based not on traditional notions of probable cause but on mere suspicion, untethered to the law or evidence, and potentially violating the Fourth Amendment s prohibition against  unreasonable searches and seizures.  The very existence of First Amendment protected expression was deemed to be evidence of illegality.The prosecution simply assumed that the conservatives were incapable of operating within the bounds of the law. Even worse, many of the investigators  legal theories, even if proven by the evidence, would not have supported criminal prosecutions. In other words, they were investigating  crimes  that weren t crimes at all.If the prosecutors had applied the same legal standards to the Democrats in their own offices, they would have been forced to turn the raids on themselves. If the prosecutors and investigators had been raided, how many of their computers and smartphones would have contained incriminating information indicating use of government resources for partisan purposes?With the investigations now bursting out into the open, some conservatives began to fight back. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth moved to quash the John Doe subpoenas aimed at them.In a surprise move, Judge Kluka, who had presided over the Doe investigations for more than a year, recused herself from the case. (A political journal, the Wisconsin Reporter, attempted to speak to Judge Kluka about her recusal, but she refused to offer comment.)The new judge in the case, Gregory Peterson, promptly sided with O Keefe and blocked multiple subpoenas, holding (in a sealed opinion obtained by the Wall Street Journal, which has done invaluable work covering the John Doe investigations) that they  do not show probable cause that the moving parties committed any violations of the campaign finance laws. The judge noted that  the State is not claiming that any of the independent organizations expressly advocated  Walker s election. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth followed up Judge Peterson s ruling by filing a federal lawsuit against Chisholm and a number of additional defendants, alleging multiple constitutional violations, including a claim that the investigation constituted unlawful retaliation against the plaintiffs for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.United States District Court judge Rudolph Randa promptly granted the plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction, declaring that  the Defendants must cease all activities related to the investigation, return all property seized in the investigation from any individual or organization, and permanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation. From that point forward, the case proceeded on parallel state and federal tracks. At the federal level, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Randa s order.Declining to consider the case on the merits, the appeals court found the lawsuit barred by the federal Anti-Injunction Act, which prohibits federal courts from issuing injunctions against some state-court proceedings.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth have petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and expect a ruling in a matter of weeks.At the same time, the John Doe prosecutors took their case to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to attempt to restart the Doe proceedings. The case was ultimately consolidated before the state supreme court, with a ruling also expected in a matter of weeks.And so, almost five years after their secret beginning, the John Doe proceedings are nearly dead   on  life support,  according to one Wisconsin pundit   but incalculable damage has been done, to families, to activist organizations, to the First Amendment, and to the rule of law itself.In international law, the Western world has become familiar with a concept called  lawfare,  a process whereby rogue regimes or organizations abuse legal doctrines and processes to accomplish through sheer harassment and attrition what can t be accomplished through legitimate diplomatic means. The Palestinian Authority and its defenders have become adept at lawfare, putting Israel under increasing pressure before the U.N. and other international bodies.The John Doe investigations are a form of domestic lawfare, and our constitutional system is ill equipped to handle it. Federal courts rarely intervene in state judicial proceedings, state officials rarely lose their array of official immunities for the consequences of their misconduct, and violations of First Amendment freedoms rarely result in meaningful monetary damages for the victims.As Scott Walker runs for president, the national media will finally join the Wall Street Journal in covering John Doe.Given the mainstream media s typical bias and bad faith, they are likely to bring a fresh round of pain to the targets of the investigation; the cloud of suspicion will descend once again; even potential favorable court rulings by either the state supreme court or the U.S. Supreme Court will be blamed on  conservative justices  taking care of their own.Conservatives have looked at Wisconsin as a success story, where Walker took everything the Left threw at him and emerged victorious in three general elections. He broke the power of the teachers  unions and absorbed millions upon millions of dollars of negative ads. The Left kept chanting,  This is what democracy looks like,  and in Wisconsin, democracy looked like Scott Walker winning again and again.Yet in a deeper way, Wisconsin is anything but a success. There were casualties left on the battlefield   innocent citizens victimized by a lawless government mob, public officials who brought the full power of their office down onto the innocent.Governors come and go. Statutes are passed and repealed. Laws and elections are important, to be sure, but the rule of law is more important still. And in Wisconsin, the rule of law hangs in the balance   along with the liberty of citizens.As I finished an interview with one victim still living in fear, still shattered by the experience of nearly losing everything simply because she supported the wrong candidate at the wrong time, I asked whether she had any final thoughts.  Just one,  she replied.  I m hoping for accountability, that someone will be held responsible so that they ll never do this again.  She paused for a moment and then, with voice trembling, said:  No one should ever endure what my family endured.

21809,[VIDEO] LEFTIST CNN ANCHOR TELLS RACIST US REP THE #BaltimoreRiots Are Vets Fault “They come back from war…and they’re ready to do battle”,"Whiskey, Tango, Hotel   Don t worry, Brooke clarified her ludicrous statement by saying:  These veterans are coming back from war and they just don t know their communities.  Yeah okay thanks for clarifying Brooke Radical leftist and open racist, Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings appears to have the answer however, he s got the DOJ involved in an investigation from  top to bottom  of the Baltimore Police Department. Once their shake-down is complete, the racist crackers will be outed, they ll be fired  and everyone can go back to business. As usual, where s there s a Democrat, there s a taxpayer funded government solution As if it s not hard enough to have to watch racist Democrat, US Rep. Elijah Cummings offer his  expert opinion  on the Baltimore riots/race war he s just giddy about we now have to listen to leftist CNN  reporter  Brooke Baldwin tell us these riots are the fault of our returning US Veterans How much more idiocy can America take? Here s a great example of a courageous US Veteran who stood tall last night in the face of a large group of thugs who were threatening the Baltimore Police with rocks and other projectiles.  Is this who you were referring to Brooke?Here s the original interview with US Rep. Elijah Cummins:After more than a year of CNN pouring gasoline all over America with hysterical, and oftentimes phony, stories of American racism, the left-wing network s afternoon anchor Brooke Baldwin finally took it to the next level by blaming American veterans for the Baltimore riots.In a pathetic suck-up interview with Democrat Congressman Elijah Cummins, Baldwin never once had the moral courage to ask the failed Baltimore City congressman if the left-wing policies ushered in by a half-century of a Democrat monopoly in Baltimore might have something to do with the city s ills. Instead, she said of young military veterans who become police officers,  I love our nation s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don t know the communities, and they are ready to do battle. The context was a discussion about increased training and retraining for the Baltimore police.There s no question Baldwin is hoping to launch a narrative with that smear.This is pure CNN; throwing out anti-science smears towards the best people this country has to offer while it is in reality the rioters who are  doing battle.  It is savages who are looting and burning and causing anarchy, not the police. But it is the Baltimore police who have 15 wounded among their ranks. It is the Baltimore police who calmly did not do much battle during Monday night s riots.Baldwin and CNN just can t help themselves. This is a cable news network that relentlessly launches Hate Campaigns to smear decent people, like Christians, as a way to deflect from the evils done by the Gaystapo and the thugs who are tearing down predominantly black, working class cities like Ferguson and Baltimore.Essentially, what Baldwin said to the world was,  Don t hire veterans! They re too damaged to be trusted with authority.  We re back to the Vietnam-era where leftists smear our heroes to cover up the real problems. CNN wants us to believe unstable veterans are the problem in Baltimore, not unstable families.But she loves veterans.Here s a great follow up interview with Mr. Valentine, the fearless veteran the residents in the city of Baltimore are fortunate enough to have living amongst them:Wine and live television tend to reveal just how ugly some people really are.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Apr 28, 2015",hotel statement war thanks leftist racist democrat rep answer investigation police department shake racist crackers everyone business democrat taxpayer government solution racist opinion race war reporter fault example veteran night face group police interview year gasoline racism left wing network afternoon anchor level suck interview congressman courage city congressman left century democrat monopoly something city nation war battle context discussion training police question smear science people country reality battle anarchy police police police battle night cable news network people way class world hire authority era problem follow interview fearless city television tend people news
2966," Whoopi Goldberg FURIOUS Over Trump’s John Lewis Attacks, GOES OFF In PERFECT Pre-Inauguration Rant (VIDEO)","As the majority of Americans are completely depressed and worried sick over what is going to happen to this country after President-elect Donald Trump is officially in charge, The View came through to perfectly point out just why Trump is such a concern.On Tuesday, co-host Whoopi Goldberg brought up a topic that most of us are still extremely upset about, especially right after Martin Luther King Day   Trump s vicious attacks on civil rights leader and Democratic Congressman John Lewis. Tearing Trump a new one for throwing a temper tantrum just because Lewis said he didn t consider Trump a  legitimate  president (face it, most of us don t), Goldberg reminded Trump that he himself has been raising questions and conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama s legitimacy for years. Urging Trump to grow the hell up and  get yourself right , she pointed out just how thin-skinned Trump is when she said: You can t do it for eight years and then be pissed off that someone does the same thing to you, comrade. Look, that s what America is built on, man. And if you re going to be the president you ve got to get yourself right, because people are going to be coming at you because now there are questions about your presidency. Maybe the same kind of BS questions you might have had if you d been thinking, had you thought about this. The women on The View also made sure to note that Lewis, the man that Trump accused of being all talk, talk, talk   no action or results,  had suffered a fractured skull while marching with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma. Meanwhile, Trump had dodged the draft and has no examples of ever being of service to others. Clearly, we all know who the real bullsh*tter is here.Railing against Trump for his complete meltdown in the form of various Twitter attacks not only on Lewis, but on CIA director John Brennan and Alec Baldwin (and others), Goldberg said what most of us have been thinking the whole time: You ve got too much time on your hands, man.

She s counting on ignorance to get votes for the Dems.Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D.) spoke on Saturday at a  Get Out The Vote  canvassing event in Arlington, Va. where she claimed Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie s tax cuts will  kill us. Speaking with Democratic supporters and campaign volunteers, Bowser talked about the importance of believing  climate change is real  and said Democrats will focus on transportation and education before mentioning Republican candidate Ed Gillespie s plan for tax cuts. Certainly those terrible tax cuts are going to kill us kill us,  she said.  And so we need a Governor of Virginia that s going to help lead the entire Virginia delegation so that we re really supporting the middle class and not just the big guys.

Others are trapped in abusive marriages.

15777,(VIDEO)REP ELIJAH CUMMINGS AND OTHERS DOWNPLAY AND LIE ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AT THE BALTIMORE PROTESTS: “I’ve gotta give it to the citizens of Baltimore…”,"OOPS! The narrative isn t fitting the truth and the truth is: Despite police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts  insistence that a minority of out-of-town instigators caused the violence, online court records Sunday showed that only three of those arrested during Saturday s protests were from outside Maryland. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) alleged Sunday that many rioters in Baltimore the previous night were from  out of town,  noting that he was amid crowds in the area.A protest over the death of Freddie Gray, a black 25-year-old, in police custody turned violent as some went on a rampage as darkness fell, seen smashing windows and throwing objects at police. I ve gotta give it to the citizens of Baltimore. I was there all day, and it was very peaceful all day,  Cummings said on CBS s  Face the Nation. At the end, there were a few people that said,  We re gonna turn this city down, we re gonna close it down.  And the next thing you know we had a few people   mainly from out of town   to come and to start beating up on police cars and throwing all kinds of projectiles,  Cummings alleged.At least a dozen people were arrested, according to The Associated Press. Police also kept Baltimore Orioles fans inside the ballpark as they cleared an area outside, which Cummings called a  smart idea. This whole police community relations situation, Bob, is the civil rights cause for this generation, no doubt about it,  Cummings told host Bob Schieffer on Sunday.Cummings noted that the Maryland delegation in Congress had asked for the Department of Justice to conduct a civil rights investigation into the death of Gray. We ve got to take this department apart and try to figure out what is wrong and what is right,  he said, referring to local police.

8219, Bette Midler Sums Up The Republican Party In One Amazing Tweet Everyone Should Read (IMAGE),"It really is perfect.And it s from a book that was published in 1961.When Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 over 50 years ago, he had no idea that a particular passage in his classic novel would one day be the EXACT description of the Republican Party.But Twitter user Maris Kreizman certainly noticed the similarities, which is why she shared the discovery, only for it to then be shared worldwide by singing and acting icon Bette Midler.In a post last month that seems to have gone largely unnoticed for some reason, Midler posted the passage, aiming particularly at Donald Trump. However, the paragraph really can be be applied to the GOP in general. It was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.  ~Joseph Heller, Catch-22Here s the tweet via Twitter.With credit. pic.twitter.com/8wrCbwEY49  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) January 4, 2016For years, Republicans have been hypocrites when it comes to lawbreaking, claiming that it s okay when white conservatives use their guns to seize federal property or use their bibles as an excuse to violate the rights of others. In other words, they want us all to think of these vices as virtues.The  slander into truth  part is pretty easy since Republicans have been lying about liberals and liberal policies throughout the last eight years while insisting that they are telling the truth.Republicans have also disguised arrogance as humility, although they really aren t hiding it anymore.The way conservative donors like the Koch brothers use pretended philanthropy to give themselves more power is one of the more disgusting aspects of Republicans today, and it was perfectly described by Heller.Republicans have also pretended for decades that stealing from the poor to give to the wealthy is honorable, but it s only caused great suffering among the American people as the middle class shrinks and families struggle to put food on the table.Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it very clear during the GOP primary that they intend to bring back torture, which they think is a patriotic and just way of fighting the war on terror. For years, Republicans have displayed fake patriotism while at the same time sending our troops to their deaths in wars for profit and once our troops come home, they refuse to take care of them. This is evident in their blockage of bills that would aid veterans and first responders.And finally, the conservative support of the death penalty and cops who kill unarmed black men are the ultimate examples of how Republicans see sadism as justice.Make no mistake, this paragraph from Joseph Heller is downright prophetic, and Bette Midler did us all a favor by bringing it to our attention.

9030, Carly Fiorina’s Poor Attempt To Pander To Iowa Football Fans Goes Horribly Wrong (TWEETS),"It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.

People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much).

1455, NATO Officials Planning For Trump Visit As If He Is A Small Child (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is a small child in a 70-year-old man s body who somehow managed to get elected president of the United States. It seems that world leaders are aware of this, and therefore are now devising methods to deal with him as such. Case in point   Trump s very first summit with the other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).NATO officials are well aware that Trump has the attention span of a toddler who needs a nap, so they are going to keep the topics simple and make sure that any remarks are limited to two to four minute bursts. In addition to the shortened speeches and elementary subject matter, the summit will have no formal statement after the meeting with the heads of state for the 28 countries in the NATO alliance. Officials in the know say that the people involved in setting all of this up to accommodate Trump s childlike ways are really scrambling, as the summit is set to commence on May 25. In short- they are going to Trump- proof the event. From Uproxx: It s kind of ridiculous how they are preparing to deal with Trump,  said one source briefed extensively on the meeting s preparations.  It s like they re preparing to deal with a child   someone with a short attention span and mood who has no knowledge of NATO, no interest in in-depth policy issues, nothing,  said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  They re freaking out. People are scared of his unpredictability, intimidated by how he might react knowing the president might speak his mind   or tweet his mind,  [a] former official said. Or, as another current senior NATO official put it before the meeting:  We re bracing for impact. As if this isn t bad enough, a big topic of this particular meeting of the NATO alliance will be how to share the costs and other burdens associated with NATO. Of course, we all remember how Trump actually gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel a bill for supposed monies she owes to NATO on her very first visit to our country. So, there s no telling what he ll say to other member nations on this topic at the summit. This worry has not escaped the international officials preparing for this event. Again, from Uproxx: His views of burden-sharing seem to be more ambitious than past presidents,  and that could become a source of tension at the big NATO confab, said Alexander Vershbow, former deputy secretary-general of NATO.  The burden-sharing conversation may not go entirely smoothly. This is beyond embarrassing. With each passing day, Trump s childish temperament, incompetence, and buffoonery lessens America s standing in the world. When will the Republicans in Congress wake up, admit they made a mistake by getting this man elected, and start preparing to oust him from office?Only time will tell.

2899, House Republicans Begin Process To Withdraw America From The United Nations,"Since 1945, the United States has been a crucial member of the United Nations, and a leader on the world stage. If Republicans have their way, however, that will end.Republicans in Congress have been whining about the United Nations for decades, and now that Donald Trump has taken over the White House, they are starting the process to force American withdrawal from the peacekeeping organization.Why?Because Trump and Republicans are mad that the United Nations condemned Israel for building illegal settlements on Palestinian land. In other words, Republicans are whining because they think the United Nations works for the United States instead of the entire world. Just as Trump thinks everything is about him, Republicans think international relations should be all about the United States.So, GOP Rep. Michael Rogers has filed The American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2017 to formally withdraw the United States from the United Nations, which would effectively create a power vacuum within the international body that the Russians and Chinese will seek to fill.Without American influence, which we have had since the organization s founding, we will be left behind as the world moves on without us. Either that, or international cooperation will collapse entirely and throw the world into chaos as nations follow the United States and adopt isolationist policies that will ultimately lead to global wars. The United Nations was created to prevent such large scale conflicts in the first place, which is why we have avoided a World War III.The bill specifically directs Trump to  terminate all membership by the United States in the United Nations, and in any organ, specialized agency, commission, or other formally affiliated body of the United Nations. And that means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.Not only would America be going it alone, withdrawal would affect our ability to keep wannabe nuclear powers like Iran in check without starting a war. Our withdrawal from international financial institutions could have a devastating effect on the world economy, including our own.The United Nations would also have to move headquarters out of the United States, which would be a humiliating loss of international prestige.For decades, the world has looked to the United States for leadership and cooperation. But Republicans apparently want America to withdraw from the world stage   a move that would erase all the progress made over the last seven decades, and tarnish our reputation forever.This cannot be allowed to happen. This country has worked too hard to bring democracy and peace to the world to quit now. We should be leaders on the world stage, not isolationists.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 22, 2017",member leader world stage way congress trump house process withdrawal organization trump land works world everything rep sovereignty restoration act power vacuum body influence organization world world chaos scale place world war bill trump membership agency commission body world bank court justice world health organization fund organization energy agency withdrawal ability check war withdrawal effect world economy headquarters loss prestige world leadership world stage move progress reputation cannot country democracy peace world world stage image
14152,TRUMP IS RIGHT: How Immigrants Sent A Staggering Amount Of American Money Back Home,"No matter which candidate you support, you have to admit that once again Trump has brought up a topic that needs to be discussed. BILLIONS of dollars are sent back to home countries from America. Think of how much we lose when $120 billion dollars leaves America! What if we tell Mexico we will stop this flow of money until they pay to build a wall at the border? The estimate for the wall is $25 billion which is nothing compared to the $120 billion that leaves America every year. While we re bleeding money out, the only amount coming into America is $5.1 billion Yes, $120 billion out, $5.1 billion in.Migrants working in the United States sent a staggering $120 billion back to their families last year, it was revealed today. The amount of money being sent by migrants across the entire world reached $530 billion last year, making it a larger economy than Iran or Argentina, the data from the World Bank showed. This worldwide figure has tripled in the last ten years and is now three times bigger than the total aid budgets given by countries around the world. It has sparked debate whether this so-called remittance money could be a viable alternative to relying on help from other governments. In the United States last year, more than $120 billion was sent by workers to families abroad   making it the largest sender of remittances in the world. More than $23 billion went to Mexico, $13.45 billion to China, $10.84 billion to India and $10 billion to the Philippines, among other recipients.In 2011, the World Bank estimated that U.S. remittances alone reached $110.8 billion, which was more than 80 per cent of the size of the total amount of cash flow ($132 billion). It is little surprise as the US is home to the largest number of migrants from developing countries; there are 42.8 million immigrants in the country, making up around 14 per cent of the population.By contrast, 2.4 million Americans live oversees, with largest populations in Mexico, Canada and Puerto Rico, and just $5.1 billion sent back in to the country, data shared on The Guardian showed. The data showed that the biggest beneficiaries included India and China, which each received more than $60 billion, followed by the Philippines ($24 billion), Mexico ($24 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion). World Bank officials believe the amount they donate could be billions more because not all cash is sent through banks and money transfer companies on which the figures are based.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Apr 7, 2016",matter trump topic home think flow money wall border estimate wall nothing year money amount yes year today amount money world year economy data world bank figure times aid world debate remittance money alternative help year sender world world bank cent size amount cash flow surprise home number country cent population contrast canada country data guardian data china world bank amount cash money transfer mail

20479,FORMER CLINTON POLITICAL ADVISOR: “I Left When Hillary Hired Secret Police to Go After Woman Victimized by Bill” [VIDEO],"Here s how Bill is paying back years of loyalty by his enabling wife Hillary, who made it possible for him to sexually assault an untold number of women. With Bill s magnanimous personality and Hillary s less than likable aura and fingernails on a blackboard orator skills, Bill has had her right where any strong and capable woman wouldn t have allowed herself to be in his back pocket. Hillary has allowed herself to be portrayed in the media as a  victim  and a loyal wife to her impeached husband. The truth is, Hillary needed (and still needs) Bill more than he ever needed her. It s precisely because of Hillary that Bill was able to prey on so many women and keep them quite afterwards. According to several sources, Hillary worked behind the scenes, threatening to do harm to any woman who would dare to come forward and expose her perverted husband for fear of destroying her insatiable desire for a powerful position in politics.During an Oct, 2014 interview, former advisor to President Bill Clinton, Dick Morris said it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton s  Nixonian  attempt to attack the woman Bill Clinton victimized and sexually harassed by hiring detectives to dig for dirt in their lives Hillary could use against them to smear their character. Dick Morris said he believes Bill was a very good president but he left because he said,  What really turned me off was what I call secret police. When she [Hillary] hired this fleet of detectives to go around examining all of the woman who had been identified with Clinton. Not for the purpose of divorcing Clinton.

23388,IRAQ 1991: US Carpet Bombs ‘Highway of Death’,"ROAR MagI want to give testimony on what are called the  highways of death. These are the two Kuwaiti roadways, littered with remains of 2,000 mangled Iraqi military vehicles, and the charred and dismembered bodies of tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, who were withdrawing from Kuwait on February 26th and 27th 1991 in compliance with UN resolutions.US planes trapped the long convoys by disabling vehicles in the front, and at the rear, and then pounded the resulting traffic jams for hours.  It was like shooting fish in a barrel,  said one US pilot. The horror is still there to see.On the inland highway to Basra is mile after mile of burned, smashed, shattered vehicles of every description   tanks, armored cars, trucks, autos, fire trucks, according to the March 18, 1991, Time magazine. On the sixty miles of coastal highway, Iraqi military units sit in gruesome repose, scorched skeletons of vehicles and men alike, black and awful under the sun, says the Los Angeles Times of March 11, 1991. While 450 people survived the inland road bombing to surrender, this was not the case with the 60 miles of the coastal road. There for 60 miles every vehicle was strafed or bombed, every windshield is shattered, every tank is burned, every truck is riddled with shell fragments. No survivors are known or likely. The cabs of trucks were bombed so much that they were pushed into the ground, and it s impossible to see if they contain drivers or not. Windshields were melted away, and huge tanks were reduced to shrapnel. Even in Vietnam I didn t see anything like this. It s pathetic,  said Major Bob Nugent, an Army intelligence officer. This one-sided carnage, this racist mass murder of Arab people, occurred while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater promised that the US and its coalition partners would not attack Iraqi forces leaving Kuwait. This is surely one of the most heinous war crimes in contemporary history. The Iraqi troops were not being driven out of Kuwait by US troops as the Bush administration maintains. They were not retreating in order to regroup and fight again. In fact, they were withdrawing, they were going home, responding to orders issued by Baghdad, announcing that it was complying with Resolution 660 and leaving Kuwait. At 5:35 p.m. (Eastern standard Time) Baghdad radio announced that Iraq s Foreign Minister had accepted the Soviet cease-fire proposal and had issued the order for all Iraqi troops to withdraw to postions held before August 2, 1990 in compliance with UN Resolution 660. President Bush responded immediately from the White House saying (through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater) that  there was no evidence to suggest the Iraqi army is withdrawing. In fact, Iraqi units are continuing to fight. . . We continue to prosecute the war.  On the next day, February 26, 1991, Saddam Hussein announced on Baghdad radio that Iraqi troops had, indeed, begun to withdraw from Kuwait and that the withdrawal would be complete that day. Again, Bush reacted, calling Hussein s announcement  an outrage  and  a cruel hoax. Eyewitness Kuwaitis attest that the withdrawal began the afternoon of February 26, 1991 and Baghdad radio announced at 2:00 AM (local time) that morning that the government had ordered all troops to withdraw. The massacre of withdrawing Iraqi soldiers violates the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Common Article III, which outlaws the killing of soldiers who are out of combat. The point of contention involves the Bush administration s claim that the Iraqi troops were retreating to regroup and fight again. Such a claim is the only way that the massacre which occurred could be considered legal under international law. But in fact the claim is false and obviously so. The troops were withdrawing and removing themselves from combat under direct orders from Baghdad that the war was over and that Iraq had quit and would fully comply with UN resolutions. To attack the soldiers returning home under these circumstances is a war crime.Iraq accepted UN Resolution 660 and offered to withdraw from Kuwait through Soviet mediation on February 21, 1991. A statement made by George Bush on February 27, 1991, that no quarter would be given to remaining Iraqi soldiers violates even the US Field Manual of 1956. The 1907 Hague Convention governing land warfare also makes it illegal to declare that no quarter will be given to withdrawing soldiers. On February 26,199 I, the following dispatch was filed from the deck of the USS. Ranger, under the byline of Randall Richard of the Providence Journal: Air strikes against Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait were being launched so feverishly from this carrier today that pilots said they took whatever bombs happened to be closest to the flight deck. The crews, working to the strains of the Lone Ranger theme, often passed up the projectile of choice . . . because it took too long to load. New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote,  With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable. In short, rather than accept the offer of Iraq to surrender and leave the field of battle, Bush and the US military strategists decided simply to kill as many Iraqis as they possibly could while the chance lasted Continue this story at ROAR MagazineREAD MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq Files",Middle-east,"April 3, 2016",magi testimony death remains compliance front rear traffic fish barrel horror inland highway mile description trucks fire trucks march time magazine highway gruesome repose men sun times march people inland road case road vehicle windshield tank truck shell trucks ground anything pathetic bob intelligence officer carnage racist mass murder people house spokesman coalition war history administration order fact resolution time radio minister cease fire proposal order compliance resolution president bush house spokesman marlin evidence army fact war day radio withdrawal day announcement outrage hoax eyewitness withdrawal afternoon radio time morning government massacre article killing combat point contention administration claim claim way massacre law fact claim combat war quit home war crime resolution mediation statement bush quarter field manual convention land warfare quarter dispatch deck ranger providence journal air carrier today flight lone ranger theme projectile choice york times leader defeat bush violent ground war risk alternative settlement world opinion offer field battle bush chance story news century wire

16516,OBAMA FIGHTS TO KEEP RADICAL AGENDA ALIVE: Asks Crooked AG Loretta Lynch To Find Way To Challenge Supreme Court Decision That Blocked His Executive Order Amnesty Scheme,"This is a good reminder of how important it is to prevent Obama from anointing another radical on the Supreme Court. It might also be a good time for every American to call their representatives in Washington. Keeping another radical Obama appointee off our Supreme Court could literally be the only thing standing between a free America and one that looks more like Venezuela. This is also a reminder for anyone in the Republican party who considers themselves part of the  never Trump  movement. The Democrat party has never been more serious about, or closer to, fundamentally changing America forever The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court s decision to block President Barack Obama s plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,  Lynch told Reuters in an interview.Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court.She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House.In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a  tremendous problem. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits.Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government. It is a matter of priority for us,  Lynch said.  When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.

21442,YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS: [VIDEO] White Girl Told She’s Not Allowed To Wear Dreadlocks To School,"Try telling a young black girl she can t wear dreadlocks to school  A Utah School has told a teenage student she can t wear dreadlocks to school, and now the mom is claiming discrimination. Except the student is lily-white.The Lincoln Academy in Pleasant Grove reprimanded eighth-grader Caycee Cunningham for wearing dreadlocks to school, saying it violates the school s dress code. Her mom, however, claims she wears them for  religious reasons,  Fox13Now is reporting.Caycee recently studied abroad in Guatemala and converted to Hinduism. She wears the dreadlocks as a result of that  spiritual journey,  mother Tonya Judd said.Students of other ethnicities are apparently allowed to wear dreadlocks, but her white daughter isn t.  My daughter is white and there happens to be other kids in the school who happen to be other race and ethnicity and they have hair that can t be combed, and there s never been an issue regarding that before,  Judd said. Principal Jake Hunt said the school s dress code doesn t specifically ban dreadlocks, but there are policies against  unnatural hair colors  and  distracting hair cuts  that all students must abide by.  Our dress code says that our students  hair must have a neat, combed appearance, be appropriate for school, and not be distracting in the classroom, which is pretty similar to what many schools in our area have,  he said.Principal Hunt said Caycee will not face any repercussions for continuing to wear dreadlocks, but she is in violation of school policy. Judd and Caycee said they will stand their ground and Caycee will continue to wear the dreadlocks and transfer schools if need be.

3246, WATCH: Conservative Radio Host NAILS Just How Dumb Trump Is For Relying On Twitter,"Donald Trump just got BURNED for using Twitter so much.During an appearance on MSNBC with Lawrence O Donnell, conservative radio host Charlie Sykes was very blunt about what he thinks about Trump s intellect.O Donnell said that Trump s tweets don t mean anything but mentioned that his tweets are causing concern because a single tweet about Boeing caused its stock price to drop.Trump s use of Twitter is causing anxiety among millions of Americans, including conservatives, especially after he picked a fight with China and sucked up to Russia while declaring his intention to expand America s nuclear weapons stockpile in what he terms a  new arms race. You just don t know,  Sykes replied.  I mean, when does this jump the shark? I mean also, this is going to encapsulate, and this is really going to symbolize the quality of this man s thought. I mean, there was a time when we had presidents who read books. Now we have presidents who write in one hundred and forty character messages. You know we once had presidents who were eloquent, who could rally the nation. But, you know, here is a president who does feel comfortable on Twitter because I do think that that is the perfect venue for the quality of his thinking. And I think that that is going to be something that s going to be a defining element in his presidency. Here s the video via MSNBC:In other words, Trump is not smart enough to get his message across to the American people in more conventional ways. He would rather lazily use Twitter and the 140 character limit, which allows Trump to avoid providing details or evidence of his claims.We all know that Trump gets crushed whenever he has to debate someone in person or gets interviewed by a journalist who does their damn job.But on Twitter, Trump presents his opinions as facts and attacks anyone who criticizes him, unleashing his deplorable supporters upon the people he targets.But Twitter is not a forum for critical thinking, and Trump has demonstrated over and over again that he is not a critical thinker. He speaks before he thinks and often lashes out over the smallest slights or any other thing Fox News bitches about in the morning.Americans are sick and tired of Trump s reliance on Twitter. They want real answers and they want details, not a meaningless blurb devoid of evidence and civility.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"December 28, 2016",trump twitter appearance radio host trump intellect trump anything concern tweet stock price trump use twitter anxiety millions fight china intention arms race mean jump shark quality man time character eloquent nation president twitter venue quality thinking something element presidency video trump message people ways twitter character limit trump evidence whenever someone person journalist job trump anyone people twitter forum thinking trump thinker thing news morning trump reliance twitter meaningless blurb devoid evidence civility image mark
13215,NEW DOCUMENTS: Hillary And State Department Aides Ignored Important “Mandatory” Training,"Hillary Clinton and her aides must have felt like  mandatory  didn t apply to them they were obviously reminded several times about the ethics training they were required to take but chose to ignore it. Not that it would have helped these corrupt people The State Department has no evidence showing Hillary Clinton or the majority of her top aides at the department complied with mandatory ethics training. McClatchy reports newly released documents show just three of Clinton s aides took the required training:State Department records show only three of nine top Clinton aides took the mandated training for new employees. Records also suggest that none of seven top aides required to take subsequent annual training completed it.No records indicate whether Clinton herself took any training. The Republican National Committee made an FOIA request for the documents last December. When the State Department did not respond within the 90-day deadline, the RNC filed a lawsuit. Today the documents the RNC received in response to the lawsuit were released. The RNC press release reads in part:While the State Department s production demonstrated some senior officials met some of their obligations under the law, no records showing completion of annual ethics training were found for Hillary Clinton or the following top aides:Cheryl Mills Huma Abedin Jake Sullivan Dennis Cheng Anne Marie Slaughter Philippe Reines Caitlin Klevorick Kris Bladerston One of the documents released today is an email exchange in which someone named Angela Jordan informs Huma Abedin that she has yet to complete annual ethics training for 2012. The email, which is dated January 17, 2013, reads in part:Hello HumaOur records indicate that you have not completed Ethics Training for 2012. Per Federal Regulation, all financial disclosure filers must receive annual trainings. If you have taken the training online or with an ethics attorney, please provide the approximate date. Two days later, Huma responds,  Angela heather samuelson has my financial disclosure form.  Jordan replies,  am not talking about your Financial Disclosure Form am talking about your Ethics training.  Huma s final response is,  Okay I wasn t aware. I ll go online.

21470,DC CHIEF OF POLICE DENIES CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMITS…NO JAIL…Christian Clerk Refuses To Issue Same Sex Marriage Licenses…Guess Where She Ends Up,"This is a perfect example of how the left is able to decide which laws they follow and which laws the rest of America follows Kim Davis, the Democrat Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses because of religious objections, was ordered to jail for contempt of court last Thursday. She suggested a compromise of removing her name from the licenses, but Federal District Court Judge David Bunning wouldn t even grant that reasonable compromise.Contrast this with Cathy Lanier, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, refusing to issue concealed weapons permits to people unless they can arbitrarily show a  good reason,  nothing required by law. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in May stopping her from denying the permits, although notably he did not send Lanier to jail for contempt.Similarly, county sheriffs in California had been denying concealed weapons permits to applicants who failed to show a need beyond self-defense. Last November, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the sheriffs were violating the law. None of those sheriffs were sent to jail, despite the fact that people around the country have died unable to obtain a permit to carry concealed.Or contrast it with the irony of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordering clerks to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004, contrary to state law. The California Attorney General sued him and the California Supreme Court ultimately put an end to the practice, but Newsom was never sent to jail.Newsom also violated federal law by making San Francisco a sanctuary city in 2007, contrary to existing federal law, but nothing happened to him. The city s sanctuary status resulted in the death of Kate Steinle in July, who was shot by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. This is a far more drastic result than a clerk who merely does not want her name on marriage licenses, yet nothing is being done to the current mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee. In 2012, Tonya Parker, a lesbian judge in Texas said she would not issue marriage licenses to heterosexual couples until same-sex marriage was legalized. She wasn t put in jail for violating the law, nor does it appear she was even disciplined at all.Not everyone would have taken the position Davis did, some Christians might have resigned rather than deal with a huge battle. Others might not have had such strong objections, viewing matters of sexuality best left alone and without government interference. When I was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Arizona, I represented agencies like the Arizona Commission on the Arts. Philosophically, I disagreed with its very existence. But I was able to separate my personal views from government laws to perform my job.The one thing all reasonable people can agree upon is that Davis was singled out and punished disproportionately compared to other public officials who didn t comply with controversial laws.This isn t about same-sex marriage, nor is it even about gay issues. It is merely one tactic in a larger goal to remove Christianity from the public sphere. There are reasonable compromises that could have been made between those Christians with conscientious objections and the LGBT community   plenty of gays consider themselves Christians   but the left is deliberately pushing for maximum conflict between the two groups in order to push one out of society.An Oregon judge announced on Friday that he will not perform same-sex marriages. Unlike the lesbian judge who said she would not perform heterosexual marriages, Judge Vance Day was immediately put under an ethics investigation by the Oregon Commission of Judicial Fitness and Disability, which plans to hold a hearing in November.This won t end with public employment. As the public sphere goes, so goes the private sphere. If companies balk, anti-discrimination laws can be used to force them to comply. The left intends to stamp religion out of society, until Christians are left secretly worshiping in their homes, hiding their status outside of the home. This is because the left fundamentally disagrees with Judeo-Christian ethics, which contradict its foundation of anything goes.Until conservatives wake up and start realizing the judicial branch, controlled by the left, has become the most lethal branch, the biggest threat of the three branches to our country and freedom, it will continue abusing the legal system to stamp out conservatism and religion from society.

5682, Trump’s Creepy Obsession With Waterboarding Gets Renewed By Istanbul Suicide Bombings (TWEETS),"Trump responded to yesterday s tragic suicide bombings at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport the only way he knows how   by ramping up the fear mongering and rallying for more violence and torture. This of course, renewed his weird obsession with waterboarding and other more extreme torture practices.In speaked at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump made his case: We can t do waterboarding but they can do chopping off heads, drowning people in steel cages, they can do whatever they want to do. You know, you have to fight fire with fire. The suicide bombings at the airport killed at least 41 people, wounding over 230. Just the day before the attack happened, the State Dept. had issued a travel warning about the increased terror threat in Turkey. According to the Turkish government, Islamic State fighters were likely responsible. Trump continued to harp on everyone s anxiety: Folks, there s something going on that s really really bad. All right? It s bad. And we better get smart and we better get tough or we re not going to have much much a country left, okay? It s bad. Terrible. Trump then spoke specifically about waterboarding, a torture practice that was banned by the George W. Bush administration ten years ago. The crowd cheered when Trump said,  I like it a lot.  Implying that if he was elected President, torture methods would get much worse, Trump added,  I don t think it s tough enough. Trump also took to Twitter to drive his point home, encouraging the U.S. to do  everything  possible to stop terrorism.TwitterTwitterHe returned to waterboarding once again in an interview with CNN. In an appearance on  The Situation Room,  Trump said he d  change our law on, you know, the waterboarding thing  in order to  be able to fight at least on an almost equal basis. Nothing s nice about it but it s a minimal form of torture. We can t water board and they can chop off heads.

151, Papa John Attacks The NFL And First Amendment After His Sh*tty Pizza Loses Him A Small Fortune,"Rather than take personal responsibility for the losses, CEO John Schnatter is making excuses.NFL players, both black and white, have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Conservatives lost their shit and decided to boycott the NFL. However, while viewership is slightly down, it s not enough to affect the corporate profits of businesses who are partnered with the league.But Schnatter blamed the NFL and the protests anyway after a quarterly report caused investors to dump their Papa John s stock, which caused Schnatter to lose $70 million from his personal fortune Leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership,  Schnatter whined.  We are totally disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago. This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago. The controversy is polarizing the customer, polarizing the country. In other words, Schnatter thinks the NFL should have banned players from kneeling during the national anthem, a move that would have violated their constitutional rights.Let s not forget that NFL players were not kneeling en masse until Donald Trump, whom Schnatter supports, attacked Colin Kaepernick and the NFL in the first place. It was Trump s attacks that caused players to join the protest.So if Schnatter should blame anyone, he should blame Trump.Let s also not forget that Schnatter repeatedly attacked President Obama over the Affordable Care Act, even going so far as to raise the price of pizza and cut his employees  hours so he wouldn t have to provide health insurance to them. Papa John s has also been guilty of stealing wages.All of this caused Americans to boycott Papa John s, which could have caused the chain to lose money as well.Schnatter s claims are also full of shit because Pizza Hut executives say their sales have not been affected by the protests. We re not seeing impact on any of that on our business,  CEO Greg Creed said.Of course, Schnatter really doesn t have anything to bitch about. After all, he is still worth over $800 million and owns a sprawling 40,000 square foot castle in Kentucky, which includes a pool, a golf course, a 22 car garage, and a drawbridge along with two other homes in Florida and Utah.Schnatter is a greedy prick who should really only blame himself for the financial losses his company has suffered. And frankly, the NFL should cut ties with Papa John s in retaliation for this unfair attack. Then he ll really have something to bitch about.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"November 2, 2017",responsibility knee anthem police brutality injustice league report papa stock fortune leadership example leadership leadership situation satisfaction bud year half controversy customer country anthem move trump colin place protest anyone let president care act price pizza health insurance wages papa chain money pizza hut impact business creed course anything foot castle pool golf course car garage drawbridge prick company retaliation attack something image
16633,WARNING SHOTS FROM RUSSIA? CHILLING Footage Shows Nuclear Submarine Launches Cruise Missile… Russian fighter pilot ‘performs barrel roll’ OVER US Air Force Plane Only 25ft Away…Obama Shrugs [VIDEO],"265 days and counting Is this a warning shot? This chilling footage shows a Russian nuclear submarine launching a cruise missile from underwater to destroy a coastal training target.The 120-metre Severodvinsk submarine can be seen sinking slowly below the surface of the Barents Sea as part of Russian navy Arctic combat drills.Then the Kalibr missile erupts from the waves in a plume of smoke and streaks away into the distance. A loud rumbling can be heard before the camera zooms in to show the launch site.It is the latest show of strength from the country s military after a number of close passes by fighter jets near US planes and ships.This year Russia has increased its military presence in the Arctic region where it and other world powers are locked in a battle to claim valuable territory and underwater mining rights.   MirrorA Russian fighter pilot has provoked fury at the Pentagon after allegedly performing a barrel roll just 25 feet from an American reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea.Outraged defense officials called the interception manoeuvre  unsafe and unprofessional , but Russia said it was forced to intercept the American RC-135 plane because it had switched off its identifying transponder.The Pentagon admitted the barrel roll incident could  escalate tensions  between the countries after a number of close-flying encounters.In a taunting statement the Russian defence ministry said:  We are already starting to get used to the insults of the Pentagon regarding alleged  unprofessional  manoeuvres when our fighters intercept US spy planes at the Russian border. The US Air Force has two solutions   either not to fly near our borders, or to turn the transponder on for identification. Reports differed on just how close the Russian SU-27 Flanker fighter jet came to its lumbering quarry. US Army spokeswoman Lt Col Michelle Baldanza said it came within 25 feet, or 7.6m, while others claimed a figure of 100 feet, or 30 metres.Lt Col Baldanza told CNN:  The SU-27 intercepted the U.S. aircraft flying a routine route at high rate of speed from the side then proceeded to perform an aggressive maneuver that posed a threat to the safety of the U.S. aircrew in the RC-135.

5557, Donald Trump Can’t Even Control His Temper In Meeting About Party Unity,"In a meeting about  party unity,  Donald Trump had trouble holding his tongue (no surprise there) toward Senate Republicans who haven t always had the most flattering things to say about the GOP frontrunner. He threatened three of them with making sure none are reelected.Trump is famously very thin-skinned. Whenever he feels he s been wronged, which is basically all the time, or whenever someone fails to fawn all over him, he retaliates. He often takes to social media for retaliation, or the campaign trail, but this time, he s threatening more and today s biggest victim if Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona).Flake isn t shy about saying that he thinks Trump would be very bad for the country. When he (Trump) refers to a judge born in Indiana as a Mexican in a pejorative way, when he calls those crossing the border rapists or when he goes after McCain (who Trump accused of being a coward because he was captured and held prisoner during the Vietnam War), somebody has to stand up and say,  This is not the Republican Party,    Flake added.  Because we ll have elections beyond this one, too, and we can t associate ourselves with those kinds of comments and be a serious national party. Source: Arizona CentralTrump responded by calling Flake  very critical of me. Flake, defending McCain, said,  yes, I m the other senator from Arizona   the one who didn t get captured   and I want to talk to you about statements like that.  Flake also insisted that he will not get behind Trump as a candidate. Trump then said that Flake will lose his election. Perhaps Trump should have uncharacteristically done his homework. Flake isn t running for reelection for two more years.The other victims of the unity meeting were Senator Mark Kirk (R-Illinois), who withdrew his endorsement of Trump and Senator Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), who is advocating for a third-party candidate.Characterizing Kirk as a loser, Trump vowed that he would carry Illinois in the general election even though the state traditionally has been solidly Democratic in presidential contests. Kirk did not attend the meeting with Trump.Source: Washington PostTrump was more cordial to Sasse, who is still not on the billionaire s side. Senator Sasse went to today s meeting ready to listen. Senator Sasse introduced himself to Mr. Trump, and the two had a gracious exchange,  said James Wegmann, the senator s spokesman.  Mr. Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. Nothing has changed. Still, Republicans are by and large falling in line with the candidate. He was greeted by applause in the House, but that doesn t mean everyone is with him. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pennsylvania), says he still needs to be persuaded, so the door is still open.Rep. Mark Sanford (R-South Carolina), who s most famous for skipping out on his job and lying to his constituents while he had a tryst with his Argentinian girlfriend, had concerns that Trump didn t know enough about the Constitution. Some were concerned that Trump has praised Saddam Hussein. Others complained of the infamous Star of David tweet that Trump insists was a  sheriff s star.  In other words, there were many members of the room who had serious issues with Trump. Come November, though, you can bet they ll all be voting for him.Featured image via Drew Angerer at Getty Images.",News,"July 7, 2016",meeting party unity trump trouble tongue surprise senate none trump time someone media retaliation campaign trail time today victim jeff flake flake shy trump country judge way border coward prisoner war somebody party flake party source senator one get flake trump candidate trump flake election trump homework flake unity meeting mark kirk endorsement trump senator ben party candidate kirk loser trump election state meeting trump source billionaire side senator today senator trump exchange senator spokesman country place election fire nothing line candidate applause house mean everyone dent door rep mark job tryst trump constitution trump star tweet trump star room image
16008,UNREAL! THREE REPUBLICAN SENATORS Kill Republican Healthcare Bill in Midnight Vote [Video],"It s clear that some Republicans never wanted Obamacare to die Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona killed the Republican  skinny  bill in a 49-51 vote. McCain could be seen walking into the room with a thumbs down to case his vote. You could hear shocked reaction in the room Sen. John McCain votes NO to defeat Obamacare: John McCain says he voted to reject a so-called skinny repeal healthcare bill in the Senate because it would not accomplish the goal of effectively replacing Obamacare. Issuing a statement the senator said he dramatically voted  no  in the small hours of Friday morning because he did not believe in forcing through the changes without at least some Democrat support.John McCain statement in full explaining, why he killed Donald Trump s skinn  healthcare repeal bill From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed, and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs and improves care for the American people. The so-called skinny repeal amendment the Senate voted on today, would not accomplish those goals. While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare s most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens. The Speaker s statement that, the House would be willing to go to conference does not ease my concern, that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time. I ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of Obamacare was that, it was rammed through Congress by Democrats, on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote. We should not make the mistakes of the past, that has led to Obamacare s collapse, including in my home state of Arizona where premiums are skyrocketing, and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace.  We must now return to the correct way of legislating, and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people. We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve. The defeat of the healthcare reforms dealt a serious blow to Donald Trump s reform agenda. Senate Republicans made clear that, unable to even pass the skinny version of their repeal bill, any kind of healthcare reform might prove impossible. This is clearly a disappointing moment, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.  I regret that our efforts were not enough, this time. It s time to move on,  he said. Mr McConnell put the health bill on hold and announced that, the Senate would move onto other legislation next week.Mr Trump responded on Twitter:  3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let Obama Care implode, then deal. Watch!

6032, Hispanic GOP Commentator Slams Trump For His Racist Comments And Fraudulent University,"Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist, commentator, and Hispanic woman, seems to despise her party s presidential candidate   and for good reason.While appearing on CNN s The Situation Room, Navarro went on a tangent against Donald Trump after his recent comments regarding Trump University judge Gonzalo Cruiel. Saying that Trump  changes more positions than yoga,  Navarro blasted the billionaire mogul for his racism and blatant disregard of the Constitution: I gotta  tell you, I m a lawyer, I am a Hispanic   it is offensive from a legal perspective, it is highly offensive as a Hispanic. What he is doing is wagging the dog. He is trying to distract from the fact he has got a problem with a case where there are allegations that his business is a scam and a fraud.  How dare he, how dare he question a judge s responsibility, a judge s adherence to the Constitution because he is of Mexican descent. Then Navarro got personal, and cut Donald Trump to the bone with some cold hard facts about Mexicans and people of Hispanic descent: This man was born in eastern Chicago. He s an American citizen. He is just as American as Donald Trump. Mexican Americans bleed just as any other American when they go to war. They bled, just as any other American on 9/11. They fight for America, they are America. And what he is doing is disgusting, I am livid about it. If this is his strategy to win over Hispanics, he s got a hell of a wake up call coming to him in November. Only Donald Trump could piss off two influential Hispanic Republican women   first Susana Martinez, and now Ana Navarro. What a great strategy Trump has, as Navarro sarcastically pointed out.Currently, only 14 percent of Hispanics have a favorable rating of Donald Trump. Among nonwhite women, which includes Hispanics and Latinas, the number is a record low 9 percent.And what is Trump doing to get their vote? Absolutely nothing. No wonder Navarro is pissed. Republicans had a chance to reach out to Hispanic and Latino voters after their 2012 autopsy and they chose the guy who would do the exact opposite.Navarro is right, he is wagging the dog. Trump honestly believes he can win with just the white male vote. And Navarro is right again   he is going to have one huge wake up call on election day.Watch Navarro s scathing take down of Trump:.@ananavarro takes on @realDonaldTrump for his comments about judge in Trump University case https://t.co/NZgH3zkuxC https://t.co/m9IMVpxzy1  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) June 3, 2016Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 3, 2016",ana strategist commentator woman party candidate reason situation room tangent trump trump university judge trump yoga billionaire racism disregard constitution lawyer perspective dog fact problem case business scam fraud dare dare judge responsibility judge adherence constitution descent trump bone people descent man citizen war strategy hell wake call trump strategy trump percent rating trump number record percent vote nothing wonder chance autopsy guy dog trump vote call election day trump judge trump university case situation room image capture

But that s not the worst of it After all the trouble and strife, still, if you have a mortgage, banks are selling those loans to third parties many times and these new corporate  owners  of your home are then foreclosing, and evicting residents, sometimes for no reason at all. After they remove the residents, they then sell the property for well below market value   leaving the ex-homeowner to cover the difference in the price short-fall. Sound like a good deal?How do you fight this international racket? Here is one story from 2011 which we hope will still inspire some folks to start taking the ponzi banks to task  CBS NewsWarren and Maureen Nyerges paid cash when they bought a home from Bank of America in the Golden Gate Estates section of Collier, County, Fla., according to CBS affiliate WINK-TV in Ft. Myers.But that didn t stop Bank of America from trying to foreclose on them.They took their case to court and, a year-and-a-half later, the foreclosure action was dropped.A Collier County judge said Bank of America had to pay the couple s $2,534 legal fees, since it had made the mistake.After more than five months, the bank still hadn t paid up. So, the homeowners  lawyer, Todd Allen, began proceedings to did just what a bank would have to get its money: legally seize bank assets.On Friday, sheriff s deputies and moving vans showed up at the bank. I instructed the deputy to go in and take desks, computers, copiers, and filing cabinets, including cash in the drawers,  Allen says.Inside, says WINK,  The homeowners  attorney was locked out of the bank manager s office by deputies while the bank manger tried to figure out what to do.

7629, Samantha Bee Brilliantly Roasts GOP Candidates: ‘Men Are Just Too Emotional To Be President’ (VIDEO),"The GOP is known for its misogyny. This is especially true of those currently running for president on that side of the aisle. So, it is only fitting that misogynist insults often used by men are turned on these guys, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee did just that on Monday s edition of her show.Women are often accused of being  too emotional  to be in certain positions, but the mudslinging and childish insults that have peppered the GOP debates and campaign trails show that men can be just as emotional   in their cases inappropriately so. Bee started her first segment with a eulogy for the death of the Republican Party in the wake of the absolute national embarrassment that is their presidential primary, then turned on the candidates themselves. She began: I don t mean to sound sexist, but I think men are just too emotional to be president. Bee then pointed out what everyone knows, saying that the GOP establishment knows that the Donald Trump candidacy is doing to their brand what his a*shole son does to real elephants. This narrative within the establishment has made old-time GOPers like former presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Arizona Senator John McCain try to urge people within the party not to support Trump.Bee says that this won t do any good, though, if past efforts by Romney are any indication, because when [Romney] tried to stand between a charismatic guy and the White House, you got beat like a Muslim girl at a Trump rally. Samantha Been is absolutely correct here. Trump will likely be the GOP s nominee, and that is absolute nightmare for them. He s an openly racist, misogynist, xenophobic asshole who bears some startling and disturbing resemblances to Adolf Hitler, and we all know how THAT ended.You re done, GOP   and you did it to yourselves. Good riddance.Watch Samantha Bee s brilliant takedown below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"March 8, 2016",misogyny president side aisle misogynist men frontal host bee edition show mudslinging campaign men segment eulogy death party wake embarrassment primary mean men president everyone establishment trump candidacy brand son establishment time nominee mitt senator try people party trump bee indication guy house beat girl trump rally trump nominee nightmare racist misogynist startling riddance watch bee image capture
6633, Elizabeth Warren Burns Trump For Attacking Hillary For Being A Woman,"If Trump thought he could attack Hillary Clinton for being a woman without being smacked down by Elizabeth Warren for it, he was wrong.Earlier this week, the Republican frontrunner capped off his sweeping victory in several states on Tuesday by accusing the Democratic frontrunner of  playing the woman card  and that her gender is the only thing she s got going for he in this election. If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get five percent of the vote,  Trump declared.  The only thing she s got going is the women s card, and the beautiful thing is, women don t like her, okay, and look how well I did with women tonight. Here s a video of his remarks via YouTube.Despite his claim, a recent Gallop poll shows that 70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump compared to 28 percent who somehow hold a favorable view.Count Senator Elizabeth Warren as part of the 70 percent.During an interview with the Boston Globe on Thursday, the popular Senator from Massachusetts hammered Trump for doing  what weak men do. Donald Trump clearly feels threatened by Secretary Clinton s qualifications to be president so he s attacking Hillary Clinton for being a woman,  Warren said.  That s what weak men do. It is an old story, and I don t think the American voters will fall for it. We need someone in the White House who isn t afraid to fight for equal rights for women,  Warren continued.  That person is not Donald Trump. Warren went on to express disappointment that the Globe didn t ask her if she thinks Trump is a sexist and she provided an answer anyway and took a shot at Trump s hair in the process. That s like asking if he has bad hair. He wears the sexism out front for everyone to see. This is nothing compared to the shellacking she gave Ted Cruz, however. Earlier this month, Ted Crus begged for money in an email by complaining about the  sacrifices  he has made to run for president. Boo hoo,  Warren wrote on Facebook.  He whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, his limited health and sleep, and having no personal time. Are you kidding me? We re supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! After listing the sacrifices the American people make every day, she suggested Cruz start doing his job to help them. Senator Cruz   you chose to run for President. Working people don t get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your  significant sacrifices    and more time trying to do something about theirs. It s too bad Warren didn t run for president this year. It would have been amazing to watch her crush these two Republican men day after day throughout the campaign.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",thought woman warren week victory woman card gender thing election man percent vote trump thing card thing video claim gallop poll percent view trump percent view count senator warren part percent interview boston globe senator trump men secretary president woman warren men story someone house afraid person trump disappointment globe trump answer anyway shot trump hair process hair front everyone nothing month crus money president boo family time health sleep time leader world people day start job president people choice time time something warren run president year crush men day day campaign image chip

Here's how they did it: pic.twitter.com/QfefM8X2cW  Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017Many readers on our 100 Percent FED UP Facebook page were enraged to think that we would even suggest that there could be more to the story than what was being reported. We were curious about what happened before Dr. Dao was dragged out of his seat. To be clear, we don t condone the abuse of any passenger on a paid flight by airport police, but we still believed there was more to the story than what was being shown in a video making the rounds on social media, that was taken by a passenger on the flight from Chicago to Louisville.We re wondering how long the United Airlines passengers would have put up with Dr. Dao s refusal to leave the plane before they became involved. After 1 or 2 hours of Dr. Dao s refusal to leave (even though he accepted to those terms when he agreed to fly with United), would the passengers have taken matters into their own hands after hours of listening to him refusing to leave? How long would the passengers have allowed Dr. Dao to delay their flight before demanding someone take action?Here s the latest UPDATE:The tense moment Dr David Dao argued with a Chicago cop just seconds before being humiliatingly hauled off an overbooked United Airlines flight has been captured on camera.Footage of Dr Dao being unceremoniously dragged from a plane at Chicago O Hare International Airport on Sunday has traveled around the world, leading to mass condemnation of United and its policies.But exactly what happened in the moments leading up to the doctor being pulled from the fight by his arms was unknown.Until now.The new video, recorded by a female passenger sitting directly behind Dr Dao, starts with a flight attendant and police officer standing in the aisle.The doctor is seen gesturing with his arm towards the cop, while talking on his cellphone. I won t go. I m a physician I have to work tomorrow, eight o clock,  he is heard saying.Dr Dao then tells the person he is talking to on the phone:  I  I tell you  make a lawsuit against United Airlines. The officer is then heard in the video again asking Dr Dao to leave. No I am not going,  he replies, shaking his head angrily.The cop then says:  Well  I have to drag you  You know how this is going to end up happening, right? Dao then replies:  You can drag me, I m not going. I m staying right here. You ll have to drag me. The cop then says,  I m just telling you, it s going to be a lot harder for you , before Dao interrupts with:  Yes I know that, I d rather go to jail. You d rather go to jail than just getting off,  the cop replies, while sounded confused at the comment. Yes,  Dao is heard saying.The two then continue speaking for a few more seconds, with Dr Dao mentioning he had flown to Chicago from Los Angeles and was desperate to get home, before the video cuts off.Here s the video:  Daily Mail",politics,"Apr 12, 2017",watch plane percent page story dao seat condone abuse passenger flight airport police story video media passenger flight dao refusal plane dao refusal dao flight someone action update moment dao cop flight camera footage dao plane hare airport world condemnation doctor fight arms video passenger dao flight attendant officer standing aisle doctor arm cop physician tomorrow clock dao person phone lawsuit officer video dao head cop dao cop lot dao yes cop comment dao dao desperate home video mail
23248,Hillary Clinton’s ‘Presidency’ has Already Begun as Lame Ducks Promote Her War on Syria,"21st Century Wire says One glaring conclusion from last night s US Presidential debate is that there is virtually no difference between either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton s view on what the US should do in Syria. Both are advocating for more war   for more airstrikes in Syria, and for  building safe zones  which are actually  No Fly Zones  (where only US Coalition aircraft are allow to fly).There is one vast difference however, between these two candidates. During her tenure as Obama s Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was both the architect of the US-led destruction of the Libyan State, and also of Washington s secret war against Syria, officially from 2011. Clinton led the notorious  Friends of Syria  lobbying tour through Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which was used to promote the US policy of  regime change  for Syria by bringing together Gulf Arab Monarchies (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, UEA and others) and other US client states to create a policy of economic, military and social subterfuge which, with the help of the CIA and others, has since destroyed large parts of Syria now occupied by Terrorist fanatical groups   who are backed by the same  Friends of Syria  member nations managed by Clinton. From start, these two wars were managed by what is allegedly a liberal  or left-wing Democrat Party. They are anything but.What this really means, is that the next  President Clinton  is already priming Americans for a escalation of warfare in Syria come this January. Here s why  In 2011-2012, Secretary of State Clinton was busy drumming up support for an attack on Syria, and supporting armed  rebel  terrorists in Syria (Image: IB Times)Diana Johnstone Consortium NewsIf the British Empire was built on the playing fields of Eton, United States world hegemony gets its training in Hollywood studios and advertising agencies. Selling your product, or yourself, by looking sincere is a cultivated American art. Current top U.S. leaders are expert practitioners.In the space of a few days, Samantha Power, John Kerry, and Barack Obama all turned in war-winning performances.Three Deadly U.S. Blows to Hopes of Peace In SyriaLast August 8, on that serious think tank the Charlie Rose show, former acting CIA director Michael Morell said that U.S. policy in Syria should be to make Iran and Russia  pay a price . Russians and Iranians should be killed  covertly, so you don t tell the world about it , he said. Morell proposed that U.S. forces begin bombing Syrian government installations, in order to  scare Assad . Probably angling for a good job next year, he is on record supporting Hillary Clinton as a  highly qualified commander in chief  and a  strong proponent of a more aggressive approach  in Syria.Act I   An Act of WarThen, on Saturday, September 17, the U.S. Air Force did exactly what that CIA insider had called for. In sustained air strikes, four U.S. jets bombed a key Syrian Army position that had been defending the town of Deir ez-Zor from ISIS/Daech fighters. More than sixty Syrian soldiers were killed and over a hundred wounded. Daech forces immediately took advantage of the strikes to overrun the government position. In effect, the U.S. Air Force acted as air cover for the Islamic fanatics U.S. to advance against the legitimate army of Syria.This was not only a violation of the cease-fire painstakingly worked out by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. It was an open military aggression by the United States on the territory of a sovereign state.The Russians immediately called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to respond to this deadly violation of the truce supposedly intended to facilitate peace negotiations and humanitarian aid. When Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin took the floor to speak, his American counterpart, Samantha Power, draped in her long red mane, walked out to give a press conference that clearly illustrated the difference between Russian and U.S. diplomacy.Churkin, like Lavrov a few days later, cited facts and analysed the situation rationally. Samantha Power put on a show of evasion and insults.Why all the fuss? was her opening theme. After all, we halted the attack when we were informed that  it was possible we might be hitting Syrian regime personnel and vehicles , she stated, adding that  if  we did so,  that was not our intention . That should settle the question; who could believe that the United States might deliberately attack the regime their politicians have been saying  must go ? The best defense is offensive, and Power can be most offensive: Even by Russia s standards, tonight s stunt   replete with moralism and grandstanding is uniquely cynical and hypocritical , she declared.Samantha Power, that conniving arriviste whose carefully constructed career has been built on moralism, grandstanding, cynicism and hypocrisy, had all the nerve in the world to turn these epithets against the prime target of her own habitual moralism, grandstanding, cynicism and hypocrisy.If the air strikes hadn t been enough to destroy Russian confidence in dealing with the United States, Samantha Power s contemptuous reaction was sure to do the trick.Act II   Change the SubjectNext ploy: change the subject. Our little accidental bombing is nothing, Power implied, compared to the alleged fact that  since 2011 the Assad regime has intentionally been striking civilian targets with horrifying, predictable regularity . Here is the core of the Samantha Power fraud, containing two elements:1/ While good-hearted bumbling America occasionally kills a few people by accident, the others do it all the time and above allintentionally.2/ Killing civilians is what war is all about. War is not about battles between armed forces for control of territory. It is not about geopolitical power struggles. It is about  civilian victims .At the close of her stunt, grandstanding and scoring cheap points, Samantha Power exhorted Russia  to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them.  Good faith? They are supposed to believe we negotiated  in good faith  an agreement which we just flagrantly destroyed?Lo and behold, only two days after the U.S. bombing of Deie ez-Zor, the subject was definitively changed when an international humanitarian aid convoy was attacked on its way to Aleppo. Twenty aid workers were killed and the aid mission was halted. Without waiting for any evidence, the unanimous cry went up from Washington that  the Russians did it! In the U.N. Security Council this time, John Kerry took the stage. Again, the critical point was the contrast between what we certainly did and what they allegedly did. Yes, we committed  a terrible accident . But what they (allegedly) did was worse. I got to tell you, people running around with guns on the ground, from the air, is a very different thing from trucks in a convoy with big UN markings all over them,  Kerry declared. He was implying that the difference was between an understandable accident, whose victims were  running around with guns , and an attack on civilians. Yes, but in war, attacking soldiers is the whole point. It can make a difference in the outcome. Hitting an aid convoy is  collateral damage , as the U.S. calls it when the bombs are American.  By bombing Deir ez-Zor, the United States was taking part in a war in which Syria is fighting for its life.It cannot be ruled out that Syrian forces attacked the aid convoy because the truce was already broken at Deir ez-Zor and they believed it concealed weapons being transported to Daech. Such things happen. Or the attack could have been carried out by rebels as an act of propaganda, a  false flag , designed precisely to be used to accuse the adversary. Such things also happen.It has already been established by careful research that the notorious Al Ghouta chemical weapons attack, attributed to Assad, was almost certainly carried out by rebels precisely in order to incite the United States to cross the  red line  set by President Obama and bomb Damascus. The War Party which by now controls the Pentagon, much of the State Department, most of Congress, as well as leading media and think tanks, has been castigating Obama ever since for not having seized that opportunity to wage a full-scale  regime change  war against Syria. The critics have never forgiven Obama for accepting the Russian proposal to use the occasion to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal, instead of overthrowing the Syrian government.But in recent weeks, as the Hillary Clinton campaign grows more frantic, Obama himself has joined the War Party. IMAGE:  Dusty Boy  Omran.Act III   Wallow in SentimentalityOn September 20, President Obama used a Leaders Summit on Refugees to portray the Syrian episode in what increasing appears to be World War III as a sentimental children s story. Obama read the letter from 6-year-old Alex, who lives in Scarsdale, New York, expressing his wish to adopt Omran Daqneesh, the bewildered 5-year-old boy with a mop of dusty hair whose photo sitting in an orange ambulance seat was iconized across the world. The letter, provided to mass media by the White House, with its childish writing but nearly perfect spelling, was full of touching details about butterfly collections and shared toys. Obama read the letter, as people reached for Kleenexes all over the country, and then commented: Those are the words of a six-year-old boy   a young child you has not learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray. We should all be more like Alex. Imagine what the world would look like if we were. The little boys are very cute, very sweet. Fortunately, Omran Daneesh s parents are alive, so there is no need to adopt him. Many other children are dead, notably in Yemen, killed by Washington s ally Saudi Arabia with arms provided by the United States. Too late to adopt them. We should all be more like Alex , Obama tells his good people. Imagine indeed, if all Americans were as innocent and na ve as six-year-old children. And indeed, that seems to be the goal of government propaganda.This propagandistic heartstring tugging is aimed at distracting from U.S. involvement in a long-term joint criminal enterprise to overthrow a government that indeed did not discriminate against people because of  how they pray , and replace it by fanatics who are ready to behead people because of  how they pray .An infantilized public will believe that  geopolitics  and  national sovereignty  are just big words that don t mean anything. An infantilized public will believe that when the United States goes to war, it is all about protecting little children from their bad, mean dictators, whose only aspiration is to  bomb their own people . They will believe that the world out there is Little Red Riding Hood, threatened by the Big Bad Wolf, and that there really is a Santa Claus.It will never occur to an infantilized public that the war to destroy Syria has been planned for years   even though someone like General Wesley Clark revealed this years ago. Or that it is carried out to eliminate Israel s enemies, keep Arabs busy killing each other, and incidentally help Saudi Arabia spread its Wahhabite fanaticism. No, that will never occur to them.They won t even notice that the Obama administration has now effectively given up any effort to justify the Nobel Peace Prize so foolishly bestowed on the apprentice president, and is now engaged in a scenario designed to prepare for Hillary s next successful regime change war in Syria.And it won t occur to them that the photo of the little boy in the orange seat was quite deliberately iconized by Western media as part of the campaign promoting the Islamic rebel-connected  White Helmets  for the future Nobel Peace Prize.Another subtle step in demonizing the  Assad regime  before Hillary takes over to administer the planned coup de grace. The future chuckler-in-chief is looking forward to seeing another head fall.

5213, Will Smith GOES OFF In Furious Rant Against Trump And His Supporters (TWEETS),"When Donald Trump isn t getting blasted for his disrespectful comments about Muslim soldiers who died sacrificing their lives for America, the disgraced Republican nominee is being reminded of what awful things he s said about other groups.Thanks to actor Will Smith, this time it s women. In a recent interview, Smith reminded everyone that Trump s infamous misogyny and sexism are not to be forgotten amongst all of the other groups of people The Donald offends in any given week. Smith ripped Trump and his followers a new one when he said: For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary. And for people to applaud, that is absolutely f*cking insanity to me. Smith specifically is making reference to Trump s comments about Rosie O Donnell, but we all know Trump s anti-women remarks go far beyond her. In the past, Trump has also attacked Arianna Huffington, calling her a  dog  and tweeting that she s  unattractive both inside and out.  And let s not forget Trump s well-known feud with Fox News  Megyn Kelly.TwitterTwitterBut Smith didn t stop there. He continued to get more outraged, saying: My grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if I had referred to a woman as a fat pig. And I cannot understand how people can clap for that. It s absolutely collective insanity If one of my sons, I am getting furious just thinking about it, if one of my sons said that in a public place, they couldn t even live in my house anymore. Smith also went beyond Trump s misogyny and called the business mogul out for his bigoted rhetoric toward basically all minorities: I think as much as we want to believe that love is the greatest human motivator, it s not. Fear is. Fear is the most dangerous and powerful motivator because when a human being gets scared, fight or flight kicks in. And there is this really separatist non-inclusive xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe that is making us pull apart farther than putting us together.The importance of leaders is that they have to be level headed, they have to be calm, because when people get scared, they lose their morality and that reptile mind takes over. It s the type of thing that you see in all forms of nature, but our leaders can t be that. For Smith, the only comfort he has in the midst of Trump s hateful campaign is his belief in America to know better than to elect the former reality TV star. Once again shaming Trump for his remarks about women, Smith said: For me, deep down in my heart, I believe that America won t and we can t (elect Mr. Trump). Of all the things he has said, and we could go through the laundry list, that was the one that was such an absolute illustration of a darkness of his soul. I just cannot figure out how people can clap for that. He added: I have faith in America. America has had really critical times but the good (people) tend to make their way to the top.

6000, Dramatic Increase In Violence Against BLM Employees Thanks To Bundy Terrorists,"According to the most recent statistics, attacks against federal range and forest workers have increased dramatically over the past year.According to PEER, an organization which keeps track of incidents of violence and threats of violence against environmental stewards, violence against employees of the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) increased sharply between 2014 and 2015.According to a press release dated May 31, 2016:Reported incidents nearly doubled (87% increase) on rangelands overseen by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and increased by more than half (60%) on national forests.The organization has maintained a database to track incidents of violence against federal resource employees since the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.PEER tracks incidents targeting a wide range of agencies employees.According to the press release, threats and assaults against the U.S. Forest Service increased in 2015, with the number of reported incidents rising from 97 to 155.Incidents involving The National Park Service and the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration also rose last year.Executive Director Jeff Ruch warns that Security is a rising concern for scientists and other specialists working in the remote Western outposts. PEER notes that the greatest increase in violent incidents involved the BLM.The District Sentinel points out that the reporting period occurred between  two high-profile acts of aggression against federal land officers by domestic extremists: the Bundy Ranch standoff, in 2014, and the armed takeover of Oregon s Malheur Wildlife Refuge, at the beginning of 2016. In the press release Ruch warns that right-wing militia groups present a serious public safety threat,  especially on federal lands in the Sagebrush West. PEER s stated mission is to protect public employees who protect our lands.According to their website:The U.S. Justice Department no longer systematically tracks assaults on federal employees. A reporting requirement for such incidents enacted after the Oklahoma City bombing was repealed in 2002 after DOJ complained that collecting this data was cumbersome.Ruch says he hopes that  By studying the patterns of these events perhaps managers can begin to defuse or prevent confrontations over federal lands.

1069," Greedy Trump Cuts Takes Housing Money Away From The Poor, Protects Millions In Subsidies For Himself","Donald Trump s budget is all about punishing the poor while enriching himself.The whole problem with Trump keeping his various business enterprises in his family is that he can use the presidency to only support policies that help him and his family profit financially. And forget about Trump actually doing anything that would harm his own bottom line.Millions of Americans rely on housing aid to make sure they have a roof over their heads and the heads of their children.But that doesn t matter to Trump at all.You see, while Trump s budget makes massive cuts to housing and shelter programs that are designed to help the poor and the homeless, many of whom are also veterans, it protects a federal program that provides millions of dollars in subsidies paid to private landlords.According to the Washington Post,One of those landlords is Trump himself, who earns millions of dollars each year as a part-owner of Starrett City, the nation s largest subsidized housing complex. Trump s 4 percent stake in the Brooklyn complex earned him at least $5 million between January of last year and April 15, according to his recent financial disclosure.Meanwhile, Trump s budget cuts the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by $7 billion. The federal program Trump personally benefits from only got cut by a mere half a percent, about $65 million.In short, while the low-income families face eviction and homelessness, Donald Trump and his family will continue drawing millions of dollars in income from the government despite owning several lavish homes, including a Trump Tower penthouse plated in gold.On top of that, Trump s healthcare bill would take healthcare away from millions of low-income families as well, which means that poor people will not have shelter or healthcare if Trump has his way.This is disgraceful and totally unethical. Clearly, Trump is designing his budget to enrich himself and his family while disregarding the needs of millions of Americans, many of whom voted for him.Americans should be outraged by this.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"June 21, 2017",trump budget problem trump business family presidency family profit trump anything bottom line millions housing aid roof matter budget housing shelter homeless program millions post millions year part owner city nation housing trump percent stake complex year disclosure meanwhile trump budget department housing development hud program trump half percent income eviction homelessness trump family millions income government trump tower penthouse gold top trump bill millions income people shelter trump way trump budget family needs millions image

18863,MUSLIM TEEN Who Wrote 3 Radical Words Over And Over Again On College Application Has Been ACCEPTED To Prestigious Stanford University,"A Muslim teenager from New Jersey was accepted to the prestigious Stanford University after he wrote  #BlackLivesMatter  a hundred times on his college application.Ziad Ahmed, a senior who attends the $34,600 a year private Princeton Day School, posted his acceptance letter and the essay that helped get him accepted on Twitter. The tweet shows that when he was prompted to answer the question,  What matters to you, and why?  Ahmed simply wrote the hashtag  #BlackLivesMatter  one hundred times.In his acceptance letter, Stanford emphasized how the university loved the  passion, determination, accomplishments and heart  shown in Ahmed s application. They also said he will be joining a  diverse, joyful, and welcoming campus community with a shared determination to make our world better  if he chooses to attend Stanford.In an interview with Mic, Ahmed said,  I was actually stunned when I opened the update and saw that I was admitted. I didn t think I would get admitted to Stanford at all, but it s quite refreshing to see that they view my unapologetic activism as an asset rather than a liability,  he added.Ahmed said he included a reference to Black Lives Matter because he feels  unapologetic progressivism is a central part of my identity, and I wanted that to be represented adequately in my application. To me, to be Muslim is to be a BLM ally, and I honestly can t imagine it being any other way for me,  Ahmed explained.  Furthermore, it s critical to realize that one-fourth to one-third of the Muslim community in America are black   and to separate justice for Muslims from justices for the black community is to erase the realities of the plurality of our community.

16031,MEDIA IGNORES! HOUSE DEM IT SUSPECTS Wanted Untraceable Payments…Then Millions Disappeared,"The media has ignored the case of Muslim Brotherhood connected brothers who hacked the DNC and now it s looking like they worked their magic to make millions disappear! They had access to the Congressional IT system! Can you believe that? Maria Bartiromo couldn t believe it when this first broke:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails.

Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller",Government News,"Jul 5, 2017",media case brotherhood magic millions access system maria family investigation police report access house information technology system myriad ghost payroll wife house absence wealth money something police access system data breach access house committee intelligence house committee report stream media criminality congress government background brotherhood video computer permission maria show bit people computer house congress people computer minimum minimum intelligence intelligence information government information talk people terrorism brotherhood part background congress deal information number background intelligence terror way yes house story staff week probe use information technology existence server house data theft computer equipment time committee chairman staff week probe use information technology existence server house data theft computer equipment mortgage debt bankruptcy business business court money time business time congress payroll credit union business bankruptcy ownership bankruptcy court assets statement wife spouse bankruptcy law spouse purpose bankruptcy code bankruptcy family record driving alcohol court drunk month house intoxication month day spokesman rep employment office spokeswoman levin house administration committee individual payroll everything office democrat connection connection post year computer hack spokesman rep employment status story caller
13591,YOU CAN ADD INSIDER TRADING To The List Of Hillary’s Crimes [Video],"Wow! Yet more insider deals with the Clinton Grifters! These people should NEVER be in politics again EVER! The Clinton corruption machine is gobbling up millions while the little people get stuck with the tab. Hillary s son-in-law is taking after his father who was in federal prison for bank fraud! CLINTON FAMILY CORRUPTION RUNS DEEP It s disgusting!It s NO coincidence that three of the biggest investors in the Greek bailout were the California Public Sector Employee pension fund, the head of Goldman Sachs or Chelsea Clinton s old boss from another hedge fund.You can be sure they got a  heads up  alerting them to take their profits and jump ship when the bailout scheme collapsed, leaving all the  little guys  to suffer.Much like Hillary s magical investment in cattle futures where she turned a $1,000 investment into a $100,000 windfall. Stock markets don t create money, they merely transfer it from the losers to the winners.So when someone with insider help scores big, it s by taking money out of the pockets of everyone who doesn t have special access to privileged information.That s why insider trading is a federal crime!Hedge fund manager Marc Mezvinsky had friends in high places when he bet big on a Greek economic recovery, but even the keen interest of his mother-in-law, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wasn t enough to spare him and his investors from financial tragedy.In 2012, Mezvinski, the husband of Chelsea Clinton, created a $325 million basket of offshore funds under the Eaglevale Partners banner through a special arrangement with investment bank Goldman Sachs. The funds have lost tens of millions of dollars predicting that bailouts of the Greek banking system would pump up the value of the country s distressed bonds. One fund, exclusively dedicated to Greek debt, suffered near-total losses.Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in 2013 to run for president. But newly released emails from 2012 show that she and Clinton Foundation consultant, Sidney Blumenthal, shared classified information about how German leadership viewed the prospects for a Greek bailout. Clinton also shared  protected  State Department information about Greek bonds with her husband at the same time that her son-in-law aimed his hedge fund at Greece.That America s top diplomat kept a sharp eye on intelligence assessing the chances of a bailout of the Greek central bank is not a problem. However, sharing such sensitive information with friends and family would have been highly improper. Federal regulations prohibit the use of nonpublic information to further private interests or the interests of others. The mere perception of a conflict of interest is unacceptable.Through its press representative, Eaglevale declined to comment for this story. Clinton s campaign press office did not respond to a request for comment.A former Goldman Sachs broker himself, Mezvinsky formed Eaglevale Management with two ex-Goldman Sachs partners in October 2011. As a  global macro  firm, Eaglevale s strategy is to seek profit opportunities in politically volatile situations. Mezvinsky set up several funds in the Cayman Islands, a secretive tax haven, with Goldman Sachs serving as Eaglevale s prime broker and banker. The giant brokerage firm has a checkered history of manipulating the value of Greek debt to the detriment of Greece. The same month that Eaglevale incorporated its offshore arm, Gary Gensler, the head of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which polices hedge funds, emailed Clinton that a bailout by the European Central Bank could  turn market sentiment  in favor of Greek bonds.Gensler had previously worked as co-head of finance at Goldman Sachs; he is now the financial director of Clinton s election campaign. Goldman Sachs has donated up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and $860,000 to Hillary Clinton s political campaigns. Shortly after Clinton resigned, Goldman Sachs paid her $675,000 in speaking fees.Clinton s deputy in charge of economic policy was Robert Hormats, a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs. Hormats and Clinton shared an extensive email trail about the possibility of bailing out Greece, including classified materials, and internal state department memos about the debt from the U.S. ambassador to Greece.Again, monitoring Greece was part of Clinton s job description, but, ethically, that does not mean that a family member should make bets that depend upon the actions of another family member leaving aside the question of whether  insider  information was divulged to Mezvinsky by Blumenthal or his parents-in-law.During 2011, Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the leaders of European governments to bail out the Greek financial system. She advocated imposing austerity measures on Greece raising taxes, cutting public employee salaries and eliminating social welfare programs to make the investors holding the debt happy.Driven by investor s belief that Greece would be bailed out, the speculative value of its debt climbed into the stratosphere in late 2011 and early 2012. The bonds gradually sank to 2008 levels by the end of the year, with temporary spikes, as investors alternately gained and loss confidence in the prospect of a bailout. In other words, there were multiple opportunities for Greek-bond hedge funds to buy cheap and sell dear.At a February 2012 summit meeting about the Eurozone debt crisis in Munich, Clinton urged leaders of the European Union to commit to a Greek bailout.In April, Eaglevale booked $19 million from a dozen investors. California s public employee pension fund, CalPERS, reportedly invested $13 million. Goldman Sach s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, jumped in with his own money, as did Chelsea Clinton s former boss, Marc Lasry, who specializes in buying distressed debt.In May, Blumenthal, emailed two  confidential  memos about the Greek debt situation to Clinton. Hormats was included in the email loop.The first memo, Blumenthal told Clinton, is  based on conversations with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble and those close to him   the information comes from an extremely sensitive source and should be handled with care. This information must not be shared with anyone associated with the German government. The unnamed spy reported that in secret meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Schauble had searched for a politically acceptable way to bail out the Greek debt in order to avoid collapsing the economies of Greece, Italy, Spain and Ireland.The second memo was classified and blacked out by State Department censors when Clinton s emails were released. No doubt, it was informative.In June, Clinton s deputy, Jake Sullivan emailed her  a depressing snapshot  of reports that Greek banks were failing and that Merkel was against a Greek bailout. The next day, he reported  re: Greece  that Ambassador Dan Smith  just spoke to the Central Bank Governor and assessed that the economic situation was  ok for now  provided that  small depositors put money back into the banks. A few days later, Clinton asked Sullivan for a confidential state department report,  Solidarity Bonds Greece Revised.  He sent it to her adding,  If you like, send it on to WJC,  presumably a reference to William Jefferson Clinton.Clinton ordered an aide,  Pls print two copies  of the Greek bond report. The report was blacked out as a  protected  document when the emails were made public.Did Mezvinsky benefit from his family connection?The emails show that Clinton did at least one official favor for her son-in-law. In August 2012, she forwarded Deputy Secretary Thomas Nides an email from Mezvinsky lobbying on behalf of his former Goldman Sachs colleague, Harry Siklas.

7386, Drug-Dealing Pedophile Rep’s Client List Implicates NH Elected Officials (VIDEO),"As Addicting Info reported here, New Hampshire state representative Kyle Tasker was recently arrested on felony drug charges, along with charges that he attempted to solicit an undercover officer, who he believed to be a 14-year-old girl, into having sex with him.If that wasn t enough of a scandal for the New Hampshire state legislator, WMUR reports that the drug-dealing Tea Party representative kept a list of his clients. That list wound up in the hands of the police department during a raid on Tasker s residence earlier this month.According to WMUR, the names of other elected officials are now confirmed to appear on Tasker s client list.Both the Rockingham County Attorney s Office and the state Attorney General s Office are now involved in the investigation, which is described as a scandal that has the potential to  send shockwaves through the entire state house. On Friday, House Speaker Shawn Jasper called on legislators who may be implicated on Tasker s client list to resign immediately, saying, Members of the Legislature take an oath to uphold our Constitution and the laws of our state, and any member of the House who has knowingly committed a criminal offense should do the honorable thing and step down from office immediately to protect and preserve the dignity and integrity of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. So far Tasker is the only representative to have resigned from office.Here s more on the story from WMUR, via YouTube.As we reported here, after Tasker s arrest earlier this month, many state officials expressed a startling lack of surprise over the drug charges.According to legislators, Tasker often smelled like marijuana and alcohol when he came to work, sometimes even bringing props to committee meetings.There s been a lot of speculation as to why, if his behavior was that obvious, no one reported him to the police or even filed a formal complaint.As it turns out, the answer to that question may very well be found in the pages of his client list.Image credit: video screen capture WMUR",News,"March 20, 2016",state kyle tasker drug officer year girl sex scandal state legislator drug tea party list list police department raid tasker residence month tasker client list county attorney office state attorney office investigation scandal state house house speaker jasper tasker client list legislature oath constitution state member house offense thing office dignity integrity house tasker representative office story tasker arrest month state lack surprise drug marijuana alcohol props committee lot speculation behavior one police complaint answer question client list image credit video capture

23086,MEDIA TRIPWIRE? Ping Pong Pizza Conspiracy Propels Internet Censorship Amid ‘Fake News’ Witch-Hunt," Funny how secrets travel. I d start to believe, if I were to bleed.    Lyrics written by David Bowie from the album OutsideShawn Helton 21st Century Wire In the days before the US presidential election in November 2016, Wikileaks revealed a new string of emails connected to Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta. Online interpretations of the leaked Podesta email exchanges subsequently led to a digital firestorm on social media, producing an intense conspiratorial  open source investigation  still in search of its smoking gun. However, the phenomenon now known by its hashtag #Pizzagate has since set a number of tertiary events into motion. Is there a real story hidden amongst the debris of this online explosion?Is it possible that  open source investigators  were being led into a virtual cul-de-sac and thus missing the real story?More importantly, could people be playing into the hands of the very establishment they seek to depose?Let s investigate   SHOCK & AWE    Over the past month, the DC-based restaurant Comet Ping Pong, along with Besta Pizza (to a lesser degree Austin s East Side Pies) has been the subject of a peculiar internet-based conspiracy. (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)CONTEXT: Podesta Emails, False Hacks & ConspiracyWhile many of the leaked Podesta emails (including the really important one admitting that US partners Qatar and Saudi Arabia are giving funding and  logistical support  of ISIS) caused a major stir in the run-up to the 2016 Election, few Wikileaks releases have attracted more attention then the Podesta emails associated with the internet-based conspiracy dubbed  Pizzagate. In fact, since the release of the so-called  pizzagate  emails, a bundle of leaks and media reports associated with the Clintons political pay-for-play allegations, as well as the shocking admission regarding voter fraud from disgraced Democratic National committee consultant Robert Creamer prior to the 2016 presidential election, have all but disappeared from the mainstream narrative. Very convenient, if you are part of the Democratic Party establishment.Remember that all of this was taking place right after the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for evil in the US presidential election   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.The media clips on YouTube below illustrate the kind of duplicitous double speak regarding the  election rigging  that has become a hallmark of the Obama administration and establishment Washington Following 2016 s US presidential election cycle, a Russian election-hack-theory gained even more media traction, orbiting the political realm like a low-hanging fruit (propelled by President Obama and now the CIA, both conflicting with the FBI s assessment in October), dovetailing with the first grumblings that  fake news  had somehow decided the US presidential election in favor of one candidate, Donald Trump. These are serious accusations that have still failed to yield any solid forensic results from the intelligence community.Is this mere political gamesmanship, or is there more at work?Could this all be covering up and diverting the public away from some other explosive events?  LOLITA EXPRESS    In 2008, Jeffery Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution (Image Source: miamibeachadvocate.com)As internet researches battle with mainstream media over allegations in #Pizzagate, another potentially much bigger story became buried under the digital avalanche. If this is indeed the case, then who benefits?The  Lolita Express  ScandalSeemingly even more unsettling and disturbing in 2016, was the vastly underreported  Lolita Express  scandal swirling around the Clinton Campaign.In 2010, Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire hedge fund mogul who is also a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations (as well as playing a role in the formation of the Clinton Global Initiative), effectively walked free even though a 53-page indictment could have landed him in prison for 20 years according to reports. Epstein s  Gatsbyesque  persona once described by New York magazine, has long since given way to a new profile as a convicted sex-offender  a superstar who was now condemned by a litany of legal troubles due to reports of ghastly serial abuse during the past decade.However, during this year s election cycle, coverage concerning new details associated with Epstein s private island, Little St. James, and allegations of sex slave entertainment enterprise there, was virtually buried by the US corporate media.The drop in wall-to-wall coverage from the tongue-tied mainstream media was most likely due to Epstein s close affiliation to former President Bill Clinton, who according flight manifests and other supporting evidence, took  at least 26 trips aboard the  Lolita Express    even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. It doesn t stop there either. Other high-profile names linked to the Epstein case included former Democratic governor Bill Richardson, Kurt Cobain widow Courtney Love, prominent celebrity lawyer, Israeli advocate and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, British royal Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, and even president-elect Donald Trump.  THE BLACK BOOK     Epstein flight records and  a little black book  paint a very intriguing picture. (Image Source: Gawker)Interestingly, the Epstein case was covered heavily by Gawker   a news outlets which is now facing bankruptcy following a defamation case won by Hulk Hogan (Terrence Gene Bollea) over the controversial publication of the wrestling icon s sex tape. Hogan s legal victory  took Gawker out  but could the real reason have been its Epstein coverage? Here s some of what Gawker said about the Epstein case: Donald Trump, Courtney Love, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and uber-lawyer Alan Dershowitz may have been identified by a butler as potential  material witnesses  to pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein s crimes against young girls, according to a copy of Epstein s little black book obtained by Gawker.An annotated copy of the address book, which also contains entries for Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, Griffin Dunne, New York Post gossip Richard Johnson, Ted Kennedy, David Koch, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, and all manner of other people you might expect a billionaire to know, turned up in court proceedings after Epstein s former house manager Alfredo Rodriguez tried to sell it in 2009. About 50 of the entries, including those of many of Epstein s suspected victims and accomplices as well as Trump, Love, Barak, Dershowitz, and others, were circled by Rodriguez. (The existence of the book has been previously reported by the Daily Mail. Gawker is publishing it in full here for the first time; we have redacted addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and the last names of individuals who may have been underage victims.)According to an FBI affidavit, Rodriguez described the address book and the information contained within it as the  Holy Grail  or  Golden Nugget  to unraveling Epstein s sprawling child-sex network. Epstein reportedly also had additional ties to Trump, with both men having on and off again been implicated in a separate Jane Doe  sexual assault lawsuit that was recently dropped in the US court system, apparently for a third time since 1994.The Washington Times discusses how other high-level clients allegedly used Epstein s services   including a member of the British royal family. The following passage is from a report filed in January of 2015: And even post-prison, Mr. Epstein kept up some of these high-profile relationships   leading to his most recent emergence in the news, which involves allegations that he provided Prince Andrew with sexual services from a then-17-year-old American girl, Virginia Roberts.Ms. Roberts, now 30, has filed a federal lawsuit in Florida against Mr. Epstein, alleging he forced her to serve as a  sex slave  and paid her $15,000 to perform sexual services for the prince, the New York Post reported. Here s Sean Stone from RT s Watching the Hawks interviewing Conchita Sarnoff, the Executive Director from The Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking to discuss Epstein s heinous past Another strange turn in the Clinton Email scandal came late in the election, only days before voters went to the polls. Suddenly, it was revealed by media outlets that due to the investigation into the sexting scandal involving disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, (husband of chief Clinton aide Huma Abedine) FBI director James Comey would announce that the agency would be reopening the Clinton email probe.Interestingly, according to a recent interview with Breitbart News, Hillary Clinton herself was alleged to have taken 6 trips to Epstein s Little Saint James island, according to private security kingpin and Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Prior to the election and right after the FBI reopened its investigation into the Clintons (before promptly being shut down for a second time), the controversial mercenary made the extraordinary claim.It s important for readers to note how explosive this revelation truly was, and yet, not one word from either the mainstream media, or  alternative media,  outside of Breitbart and few other blogs, on this potentially devastating allegation. Prince asserted that the NYPD found  way more stuff  within the 650,000 recently scrutinized emails. The news reportedly sent shock waves into the upper echelon of the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign   as the NYPD was said to have been ready to hand out indictments  into additional criminal activity, possibly involving money laundering and underage sex, among other illicit activity.Prince s commentary on the Democratic Party s apparent corruption was released around the same time as a batch of Podesta Emails that sent internet sleuths down a pizzagate rabbit hole. Prince s claim then seem to be grafted onto the pizzagate theory by some YouTube commentators, only without any actual concrete evidence.In early 2016, the embattled Blackwater (renamed Academi, and then Xe) founder Prince, was the subject of an inquiry that alleged he was involved in a major money laundering scheme with the Bank of China in Libya. In 2014, Prince supposedly setup  Frontier Services Group in 2014 with the help of major Chinese investment firm Citic Group. When you factor in how Prince himself became the subject of a major scandal and is now on the offensive, it s hard to know whether his claims are true or just a political ploy aimed at deflecting his own controversy. However, his claims do offer a dark view into a political party that has been in a downward spiral for several years.Wheat from the ChaffWith all of that in mind, for any true investigation to take place, the facts still need to be separated from what might only be innuendo and overt speculation.Other apparent conspiracies were also brought into the fold during the ascendency of #pizzagate, as social media users seemed to make some startling connections, although without a complete story. The lack of coherence of pizzagate allegations opened the door for some of the usual suspects to come in to steer the conversation away from some potentially damaging connections back to the Clintons. Establishment gatekeeper publication The Daily Beast reported the following in the passage below: Written by user  PleadingtheYiff,  the post attempts to link the Clinton campaign to Laura Silsby, an Idaho missionary who served a six-month prison sentence in Haiti after the organization she founded, New Life Children s Refuge, attempted to transport 33 Haitian children to the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.The user s primary proof of links between the Clintons and Silsby:  Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman s organization.  The post provides no email sent from Clinton to Abedin regarding the incident.The theory then includes a major error. One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook,  PleadingtheYiff writes, then links to a website called  AboveTopSecret.com. Silsby wasn t freed and instead remained incarcerated in Haiti, where she faced trial and was found guilty. The nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed. Is it possible that the Laura Silsby case was buried under endless collateral damage from pizzagate?With even more damning American conspiracies in 2016, such as the DNC fraud, violent protests funded by George Soros, or the Pentagon paying PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to produce fake terror videos, in addition to the Lolita Express revelations concerning the Clintons in particular, you have to wonder whether the pizzagate theory was an unintended coincidence or if it was yet another socially engineered agenda that masked other media stories.What s most obvious, however, is how the pizzagate story and spin-off controversies appear to have obfuscated other real criminality contained within the Podesta email leaks, while providing a media smoke screen for the conspiracies mentioned directly above.In the article below we ll take another look at the pizzagate phenomena (along with Comet Ping Pong s gunman story, in addition to one of Washington DC s most notorious scandals) and how the events surrounding the online conspiracy, could be used to shape new censorship protocols in the wake of US media s witch-hunt for  fake news  sites   LEAKED    John Podesta former chairman for Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign, pictured with Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin on the Clinton campaign jet. Spirit Cooking & #Pizzagate: A Media-Driven Psy-Op?Within the contents of the controversial Podesta dispatch by Wikileaks in early November, there appeared to be a distressing email chain between Tony Podesta, a top Democratic lobbyist of the Podesta Group (brother of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman) and a New York City-based Serbian performance artist named Marina Abramovic.The 2015 email exchange between Tony Podesta and Marina Abramovic (image, left) drew a sharp outcry from users on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, after the email conversation revealed a dinner party involving a performance art-based ritual calling for the use of real human blood and bodily fluids, referred to as  spirit cooking.   While Abramovic s occult-influenced art could be seen as sick and deeply disturbing to many, and even degenerate depravity to some   it s important to emphasize there was nothing criminal about her email with Tony Podesta or her dark creations captured on video from as early as two decades ago.The origins of Abramovic s spirit cooking appeared to some researchers to be linked directly to Aleister Crowley s, Thelma religion. This prompted some alternative media outlets to link to Everpedia as their primary source to explain the  truth  behind spirit cooking. The internet-based conspiracy ultimately led to increased speculation, turbo-charging even more spurious connections.Another major magnet for pizzagate researchers was Abramovic s book published in 1997, the self-proclaimed  grandmother  of performance art released a book entitled  Spirit Cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,   a rare book that contained a sequence of etchings and perverted recipes.As theories about spirit cooking exploded on social media, a series of Podesta emails were leaked containing what had been thought to be coded language concealing an elite underground child sex ring, according some quasi-investigative online sites and mega forums, citing 4chan and Reddit posts.In addition, it appears that a series of emails released by Wikileaks, here and here, are partially what led to one man, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, to become the central pizzagate antagonist. The fact that Alefantis is listed as one of DC s top 50 most influential people   only fuelled speculation that the internet case was  a slam dunk. Social media inquisitors shared pictures from the Instagram account of Alefantis (now blocked to the public) and other friends and contacts linked with him, in an attempt to conclude a vast conspiracy. While many of these images appeared disturbing in the context of the two conspiracies mentioned above, the images themselves did not prove any actual crime had taken place.As the conspiracy deepened, symbols from the Washington DC restaurant/venue Comet Ping Pong (derived from its menu and logo, as well as other pizza restaurants), in addition to apparent coded Podesta emails, sparked an outcry on social media as the symbols used appeared to mimic those according to a Wikileaks release supposedly from the FBI. The apparent leaked release from the FBI disclosed certain markers in sex trafficking and abuse cases. While there might be similarities in the graphics observed at Comet Ping Pong and nearby Besta Pizza, the evidence is still purely circumstantial and certainly nothing conclusively linking the DC-based pizzerias to any abuse ring. Internet trawlers also claimed to have unearthed photos of the digging of a secret basement-dungeon underneath Comet Ping Pong   a claim which later turned out to be false.Note that this one planted detail in the pizzagate story   the evocative image a  secret basement  reserved for child torture and abuse   sent this story into orbit. This is one example of how one or two simple details injected into a storyline can inflame the narrative and motivate forum users beyond what any real forensic investigation could, by creating a virtual crusade.In fact, it was revealed that  Comet uses a low-slung refrigerator at Buck s Fishing & Camping, Mr. Alefantis s other restaurant two doors down on the same block, to store produce, cheese and proofing dough.   (See left photo by Cecilia Kang)It s worth noting that 4chan was also behind one of the most speculative claims surrounding MH370, a story that allegedly involved the patent holders of the tech company Freescale Semiconductor which turned out to be false. Conversely, 4chan has provided some valuable crowd-sourced information, like in the wake of the 2013 Boston Bombing when 4chan users posted a number of photos indicating the presence of other operatives involved in the event   a point totally blacked-out by US authorities and media.Interestingly, the 4chan website is said to be  struggling to survive  financially in part because of increased users driven by viral and clickbait-like material like pizzagate.Through hyper-speculative and often misleading information spread by social media users, the pizzagate narrative took shape Media TripwireAs the US media brushed off the perceived content of the Podesta emails mentioned above, a ground swell of speculation, hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims filled the vacuum online, as enthusiasm continued unabated.It s also important to recognize that one of the main propellers of the initial Pizzagate story was a popular disinformation website called Your News Wire, who regularly feed the public with completely fake news stories online which get propagated through social media. This website has successfully managed to fool many online readers because it will regularly mix real news articles in with its many invented stories. A viral fake story like this would have netted  Your News Wire  tens of thousands of dollars in ad click revenue.BuzzFeed reports: On Oct. 30, a white supremacy Twitter account that presents itself as belonging to a Jewish lawyer in New York tweeted that the NYPD was looking into evidence that emails from Anthony Weiner s laptop contained evidence of Clinton involvement in an  international child enslavement ring. The next day, Oct. 31, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who used to work with British conspiracy theorist David Icke, took note of the message board post and the tweet. He wrote a post for his site, YourNewsWire.com. His story took another step by claiming an  FBI insider  had confirmed the claims. Where did this this new FBI source come from? Adl-Tabatabai cited a thread on a 4chan message board from back in July. That thread started when an anonymous user invited questions after describing themself as  a person with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case.  (Adl-Tabatabai did not respond to questions sent to him by BuzzFeed News.) By this point, the story became a viral ball of fire, and there was no stopping it.You have to wonder if the spirit cooking/pizzagate emails, might have been used as a tripwire by the establishment to initiate increased internet censorship, a story that has gathered a big boost from highly speculative ideas pasted together by various social media personalities on YouTube and then codified by large popular  alt-media  outlets like Infowars.com here and here, who levied unconfirmed allegations at Comet Ping Pong restaurant and other private businesses in an affluent area of Washington DC.Few conspiracies in recent years have generated as much public outrage, scrutiny and intense speculation. However, we should question the timing of this conspiracy as it relates to the cyber censorship on the table following the  fake news  crisis.The BBC stated the following after a Podesta email thread leaked in November, mentioned the Alefantis connection: In early November, as Wikileaks steadily released piles of emails from Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta, one contact caught the attention of prankster sites and people on the paranoid fringes.James Alefantis is the owner of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington. He s also a big Democratic Party supporter and raised money for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He was once in a relationship with David Brock, an influential liberal operative.Alefantis   who s never met Clinton   appeared in the Podesta emails in connection with the fundraisers. Other claims attached to the pizzagate theory included a link to a tweet from the deceased investigative reporter, Andrew Breitbart. The pizzagate theory seemed to gather steam from this screenshot of an alleged Breitbart tweet below   but is there more to the story?Upon reviewing the origins of the Breitbart tweet now intertwined with the pizzagate theory, there appears to be some contention about what Breitbart might have been referencing. Here s the political blog Hot Air on the matter: It s a classic Andrew Tweet. His abbreviations, his invention of words ( cover-upperer ) tells me that this was probably Andrew s work. I never really knew him to allow anyone to Tweet on his behalf but I suppose it s possible at some point he did so without my knowledge. So, for our discussion let s stipulate that it was Andrew who sent this out. What is he talking about? Anyone who knew Andrew well and worked closely in his sphere and knew what he would talk and Tweet about with regard to  underage sex slave(s)  and John Podesta, knows exactly what he is referring to: ACORN If you don t remember James O Keefe, Hanna Giles and the ACORN story that broke on Andrew s Big Government website in 2009, here s a quick description via Wikipedia, which has a lot of bogus takes on the story, but this brief description is correct: In July and August 2009, Giles and O Keefe visited ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, San Diego, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami. Giles dressed as a prostitute, while O Keefe wore white khakis with a blue dress shirt and/or tie and claimed to be her boyfriend. Giles and O Keefe recorded the encounters using hidden cameras and pretended to be seeking advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade. The article goes on to state that the ACORN saga, which had been instrumental in Breitbart s rise in media, had been in some aspect involved an underage abuse story due to the undercover work of James O keefe and Hannah Giles.  STRANGE DAYS    Comet Ping Pong resides in a quiet affluent DC neighborhood. (Image Source: chicago sun-times)The Comet Ping Pong GunmanIn early December, 28 year-old actor Edgar Maddison Welch was arrested by authorities after reportedly discharging a rifle inside Alefantis s Comet Ping Pong restaurant. Welch had been apparently  self-investigating  Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the epicenter of a shocking conspiracy asserting that the establishment is somehow allegedly involved in an expansive child trafficking abuse ring.Welch s background may have raised a few eyebrows of those who have chronicled the profiles of various gunman in recent years (such as his acting/film production past documented on IMDB), he was also recently involved in a major traffic accident in October, badly injuring a young teenager, potentially impacting his state of mind, as well as being exposed in a potential criminal case.While 21WIRE has outlined the possibility of informants being used in shooting events in the past   usually those individuals have had a lengthy criminal past with multiple links to government, military and sometimes the entertainment industry   Welch doesn t entirely fit this typical mold of a convict turned informant or agent provocateur.Perhaps there s another answer The online site Heavy.com released the following information regarding Welch s father and his work preventing child abductions: Harry Welch Jr. is a former police officer, firearms instructor and expert witness on firearms, according to his IMDB profile. He also writes that his family has hosted foster children and has worked to prevent child abuse.He was,  elected President of the North Carolina Crime Stoppers Association (two terms). Served as Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children. Appointed by Governor Jim Martin to the Governor s Commission on Child Victimization. Was Welch under psychological duress following his recent car accident, feeding into other aspects of his life, such as his father s work to prevent child abuse, then motivated into action by an online conspiracy?Although it s difficult to accurately gauge Welch s true motivation, some YouTube personalities absolutely contend that his involvement was scripted    to smear the a new burgeoning  pizzagate research community  online. Additionally, some researchers cite Welch s relief visit to Haiti in 2010, as absolute  proof of a hoax  because alleged Clinton Foundation ties to human trafficking in Haiti   claims that have to this date, have yet to be completely proven.This part of the pizzagate conspiracy gained steam when Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, who over the summer was working for  Claude d Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver,  apparently died of a suicide in mid November while in Haiti. However, at the time the circumstances of her death were not entirely clear, which led to intense speculation not grounded in fact. If there was evidence of foul play, certainly this could be investigated as part of a possible cover-up, especially during such a hotly contested US election involving the Clintons   but until that issue is resolved, any talk of  proof  of a wider conspiracy is still just that, talk.The Petersen tragedy was then grafted onto the pizzagate story The Washington Post reported the following, according to executive director d Estree:  Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a  brilliant  research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara. Unfortunately, Petersen s story got packaged with allegations of a Clinton trafficking conspiracy that was then interwoven within the pizzagate theory and on the same day Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong, the widely-known site Infowars.com  posted a YouTube video titled  Haiti PIZZAGATE: Death of Child Trafficking Investigator,  without actually confirming the full details surrounding Petersen s death. Everpedia, one of the first websites to explain the details of spirit cooking, appeared to also fan the flames of an alleged conspiracy surrounding Petersen s death.An ABC News release below disclosed the full details regarding Welch s apparent criminal activity at Comet Ping Pong: At around 3 p.m., he arrived at the restaurant, where witnesses say they saw Welch holding an assault rifle across his chest, according to the complaint. As he moved toward the back of the restaurant, employees and customers fled the building.As everyone was fleeing, Welch encountered an employee returning from the back freezer, according to court documents. The employee said Welch pointed the AR-15 rifle in his direction, the documents state, but Welch denied raising the firearm at the employee.After the customers and employees left the restaurant, police created a perimeter around it, and at about 3:24 p.m. Welch exited the building with his hands in the air, complying with officers. The story continued, with the following description: At one point he said he encountered a locked door and attempted to open it with a butter knife, the complaint says. When that didn t work, he fired shots at the lock with his AR-15, documents say. Here s a screen shot of Welch s incident report MSM Fake News Witch-HuntFor the mainstream media, pizzagate was the gift that just kept on giving.Following Welch s encounter inside Comet Ping Pong, the conspiracy known as  pizzagate  has fallen into the manipulative hands of the corporate mainstream media, now castigating  speculative alternative media outlets,  which in-turn gave legs to the already convoluted  fake news witch-hunt being waged by mainstream media   specifically aimed at independent outlets and blogs that regularly produce insightful critical analysis.Additionally, since the spirit cooking and pizzagate theories were merging, there has been no solid evidence linking the restaurant to anything criminal, yet the theories continue to persist online, implicating private citizens in what is at this point a  victimless  crime. This has made alternative media an easy target for mainstream media and politicians calling for more  control  over social media content to help stop waht mainstream pundits were now describing as pizzagate s own campaign online abuse and  internet bullying  against Comet Ping Pong s owner and staff.From a legal stand point, the pizzagate conspiracy could also potentially lead to a court case against the root cause of certain defamatory allegations and apparent death threats   as Alefantis and other shop owners are private citizens and not public figures. This is something to consider when presenting any possible theory directly implicating an individual in a major felony. Unless there exists a real forensic smoking gun, or a whistleblower willing to come forward then there is no  case    only speculation which could be construed as libel and defamation without any supporting evidence.While the internet has zeroed-in on pizzeria-based conspiracies over the past two months, it s important to remember that Washington has had a long dark history linked to illicit prostitution and sex trafficking   including at least two such expansive cases that reached all the way to the White House   DISGRACED    Former US Congressman Barney Frank. Frank did not seek re-lection in 2012 after he was found to have engineered a $12 million TARP bailout for OneUnited Bank. (Image Source: businessinsider.com)Washington s Silence: Congressman Frank s  Call Boys In 2011, Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, decided not to seek re-election. While much of the mainstream media waxed poetic about his 30-year career, there was virtually no mention of his involvement in one of the most notable DC scandals over the past three decades.In 1989, it was discovered that Frank s then boyfriend Stephen Gobie (who the US representative once solicited for an $80 dollar sexual encounter) had been running a prostitution ring out of Congressman Frank s Capitol Hill apartment   according to Gobie, Barney Frank was fully aware of the operation.Here s a passage from a Business Insider article from 2011 that describes one of DC s darkest scandals that is barely mentioned by media outlets to this day: Reuters didn t mention it. The New York Times didn t bring it up. The Guardian didn t note it either. The Washington Post got to it in the 17th paragraph.In 1989 it was discovered that Barney Frank s boyfriend, Stephen Gobie, whom Frank had once hired as a male prostitute, was running a male-brothel out of the Congressman s home. Frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home, but he did use the power of his office to  fix  33 tickets for Gobie. And he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to Gobie s probation officer in Virginia. Frank received a  reprimand  for fixing the tickets. Gobie maintained that Frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home. Even writers who were absolutely untroubled by the openly homosexual lawmaker in 1989 thought that Frank should have resigned. Or they at least acknowledged that there was an abuse of his office. Additionally, the Washington Post reported that Gobie  maintained a relationship with Gabriel A. Massaro, the principal of Chevy Chase Elementary School, and used an office at the school in late 1987 to make telephone calls and have one client meet a prostitute. While Massaro was placed on administrative leave, the conspiracy deepened as the Washington Post followed up the breaking story providing the following details: With Congress in recess, it s too soon to tell if the Massachusetts Democrat will weather his admission that he paid Gobie for sex, hired him as a personal aide and wrote letters on congressional stationary to the convicted felon s probation officer. Shockingly, the scandal continued to persist as the investigation led to other political inquiries. Frank s scandal appeared to overlap and dovetail with another disturbing ring that reached all the way to the White House during the Reagan-Bush era.The Franklin Cover-upThe Barney Frank scandal indeed followed another appalling and chilling scandal dubbed the  Franklin Cover-up.  The shocking case involving Omaha, Nebraska s Franklin Credit Union employee named Lawrence King, who looted his employer to the tune of $38 million dollars. Here s a Washington Post article from 1990 on the matter: Lawrence E. King Jr., everyone now agrees, had a remarkable knack for stretching a dollar. On a salary of $16,200 a year, the credit union manager drove a $70,000 white Mercedes   and still could afford to spend $10,000 a month on limousines. His credit card charges topped $1 million, he owned a four-story house on 26 acres overlooking the Missouri River, and his floral bill alone came to $146,000 during a fragrant, 13-month period in 1987-88. While King s embezzlement was troublesome, it paled into comparison to a wider charge of trafficking and abuse levied at the credit union manager. The Post continued, outlining the awful truth about the abuse tied to King, in a group called the Franklin Five: In June 1988, a social worker at a mental hospital in Omaha reported allegations of possible child abuse to the Nebraska Foster Care Review Board, an agency that monitors the placement of several thousand children in the state.The board subsequently asked Omaha police and the state attorney general to investigate possible  child exploitation,  a  child prostitution ring  and  inappropriate activities by Larry King. More evidence in the same report revealed the following: 21 hours of videotaped testimony from three new witnesses, all in their early twenties, who said that, as minors, they had been victims of physical and sexual abuse. The book entitled The Franklin Cover-up, by former Nebraska state Senator and lawyer, John De Camp, chronicled a case that implicated politicians, judges, those in the military, police, as well as members of the intelligence community in the subsequent abduction of numerous children over the course of many years.Lawrence King was eventually convicted on charges of theft from the Franklin Credit Union and ordered to pay damages to Paul Bonacci for the apparent abuse he suffered during his abduction. Bonacci later told investigators he had participated in the abduction of Johnny Gosch, but according to (Polk County Attorney John Sarcone ) The Des Moines Resgister,  Bonacci has said he took part in Johnny Gosch s abduction, but Sarcone said investigators concluded any involvement by Bonacci was not credible. Here s a short summary of the disturbing case below: On February 5, 1999, in U.S. District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, an extraordinary hearing occurred in Paul A. Bonacci v. Lawrence E. King, a civil action in which the plaintiff charged that he had been ritualistically abused by the defendant, as part of a nationwide pedophile ring linked to powerful political figures in Washington and to elements of the U.S. military and intelligence establishment. Three weeks later, on February 27, Judge Warren K. Urbom ordered King, who is currently in Federal prison, to pay $1 million in damages to Bonacci, in what Bonacci s attorney John DeCamp said was a clear signal that  the evidence presented was credible. The Frank and Franklin conspiracies outlined above sent shock waves through the establishment in Washington, and while it is possible we are seeing another trafficking cover-up happening again today, one should consider that thus far, there have been no victims found to have been abused regarding Comet Ping Pong or any other business wrapped up within the online pizzagate theory.A Franklin Cover-up documentary called  Conspiracy of Silence  was made and allegedly pulled from circulation following the fallout from a case that also implicated the Catholic founded non-profit orphanage, Boys Town.In a related scandal exposed in 2002, The Boston Globe s Spotlight Team  first revealed that the leader of the Catholic Church in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, allowed one of his priests to continue working even though Law knew that Fr. John Geoghan had spent his career sexually assaulting children. The story became so huge, that it led to more than 250 priests being publicly named in abuse allegations, covering some 100 cities in the US and another 100 globally. In 2015, Hollywood released the film Spotlight, which chronicled the tales of abuse.Similarly in the UK, over the past few years, an investigation into the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal  was compounded by BBC s own cover-up of the serious claims. The Savile scandal and cover-up featured many whistleblowers and victims coming forward, and also showed a high degree of cover-up at the police department level as well.While observing the connective aspects of various scandals, DC s political scene has also revealed some telling business and establishment links which raise even more interesting questions   MEDIA MACHINE    Democratic political operative David Brock. (Image Source: twitter)There are some interesting aspects of pizzagate which have been almost untouched by internet sleuths.Below we ll take a look at George Soros-funded Media Matters and its director David Brock and examine his past connections and tangential links to both Barney Frank and James Alefantis Media Matters  & Political PlotsIn 1997, political operative David Brock was once a right-wing media hit-man so to speak, writing conservative op-ed s taking on college campus  marxists  and was an investigative reporter for the weekly news magazine Insight on the News (published by The Washington Times). Some time later, Brock became a Democratic political operative and Soros righthand man at Media Matters.Some reports also claim that Brock (seen on the left with Barney Frank) joined on with Sidney Blumenthal and the Clintons simply over money   but others suggest a different tale   one that took place during the course of Brock completing a somewhat strange book entitled  The Seduction of Hillary Clinton,  which deflected controversies aimed at the Clintons and took a softball approach to Hillary s political evolution.Over the years, many critics have questioned Brock s hidden Washington past and his unlikely political evolution Blackmail? Brock, Grey & AlefantisIn 2012, FOX NEWS revealed the following, as Media Matters chief David Brock paid a former domestic partner $850,000 after being threatened with damaging information involving the organization s donors and the IRS   a deal that Brock later characterized as a blackmail payment, according to legal documents obtained by FoxNews.com. Brock s bitter separation from William Grey led to accusations of blackmail and harassment: In an acrimonious lawsuit settled at the end of last year, Brock accused William Grey of making repeated threats to expose him to the  scorn or ridicule of his employees, donors and the press in demanding money and property.  Brock claimed in legal papers that he sold a Rehoboth Beach, Del., home he once shared with Grey in order to meet Grey s demands, which he called  blackmail  in the lawsuit. Brock s legal trouble with Grey appeared to be the result of a severed relationship after 10 years, with Brock ending the relationship, he began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis,  according to reports.Considering how Brock and Grey s end played out according to court records revealed by the media, one might consider that this latest DC drama unfolding in the form of pizzagate, could also be the result of bad-jacketing (as suggested by the blog auticulture) after a bitter love triangle involving the trio   in the lead up to one of the most contentious US presidential elections in history.According to Ward Churchill s,  Agents of Repression: The FBI s Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement: Snitch-jacketing or bad-jacketing refers to the practice creating suspicion   through the spread of rumors, manufacture of evidence etc Bad-jacketing had been a technique employed by the FBI under their program COINTELPRO.Domestically in America, the FBI created the counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO, to influence, disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out, infiltrating countless political groups and movements. According to reports these included the following,  The Black Panther Party, The Communist Party of America, the Ku Klux Klan, the Socialist Workers Party, the New Left, the Students for a Democratic Society, the American Indian Movement, the Chicano Movement, the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement, Communist groups, anti-war organizations, Hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups, and civil rights leaders. Between 1956 and 1971 the FBI s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America. No part of politics was immune to COINTELPRO.Is it possible that a DC love triangle that once involved Brock, Grey & Alefantis, led to a PR-driven form (as a part of Brock s Correct the Record or something else) of bad-jacketing which then cascaded through the Democratic Party elite, ultimately taking its triangle shape   through the use of pizzagate and others? MEDIA CONTROL    (Photo illustration redesigned by 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Censorship & the  Fake News  Witch-HuntIn early November, just prior to the US presidential election, CNN published an article stating the following: A recent BuzzFeed study of  hyperpartisan Facebook pages  found that these pages  are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information. Three weeks later in a republished article written by Robert Parry from Consortium News, it was disclosed that major media companies had been heavily involved in pushing the fake news meme, citing many election-based posts made online as the culprit: In its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. Below is a passage from a recent report filed at 21WIRE discussing the fake news witch-hunt, which has now led to new calls for internet censorship: Over the past month, The Washington Post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the 2016 US election results on  fake news  dispensed via sophisticated Russian propaganda. These accusations of course were completely unfounded, deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by US government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception.While the US mainstream media contends that  fake news  somehow altered the 2016 presidential election cycle, it s important to remember that the US government has some pedigree here, having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now.Back in 2011, The UK s Guardian reported that the US government via CENTCOM, was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts: The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities   known to users of social media as  sock puppets    could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations  without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries . This is just one example. Who really knows how widespread this practice is.You can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream, along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media, its intended target. Western media s anti-Russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat, thanks to Facebook, Google and Twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies, Washington has a new go-to scapegoat joining the tired old Russian  hack  meme   independent media. SEE ALSO: Washington Post Sloppy  Journalism  Blames Russia for  Fake News  Crisis and Trump s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyismIt appears as though there has been a coordinated effort to combine the latest run of conspiracies in America, whether it s the fake news meme, the  Russian election-hack  meme or pizzagate    they all seem to be have been used to undermine key aspects of internet freedom.Below is an interview with James Alefantis featured on Megyn Kelly s Kelly File discussing the highly speculative pizzagate theory. During Kelly s interview, the focus centered around unsubstantiated claims levied at the business owner and his place of business Here s a very detailed analysis provided by researcher David Icke discussing the multi-layered theories wrapped up in the pizzagate conspiracy and its relation to censorship and so-called  fake news In ConclusionThe overtly conspiracy-tinged pizzagate theory, emerged like a hydra out of sub-Reddit and 4chan threads and Twitter posts, while catapulting only the most sensational aspects into the mainstream matrix. The story conjures many Hollywood and government tales of cover-up, murder, abuse and deception throughout history.The perceived presence of a politically charged Satanic sex-cult intertwined within a paedophilic abuse ring, seemed to have only enhanced the narrative for many internet-sleuths, who in some cases, held steadfast to a biased guilt-by-association meme   even in the absence of any known victims, and without any forensic evidence or any eye-witness testimony of a crime.This is not to suggest that VIP child sex rings and ritual abuse cases do not exist in America. One such murder spree, known as the  Son of Sam  case, was reopened in part due to evidence of Satanic cult activity and multiple offenders. Although the findings were suspended, the case was never officially closed.While people should certainly have the ability to express their opinion about pizzagate without shame or ridicule, using biased, misleading or fraudulent information (in some cases dispensing defamatory or threatening remarks) in a rapid-fire echo chamber, could ultimately undermine any legitimate investigation if there truly was a crime committed here, or elsewhere. If that is the ultimate legacy of pizzagate, then it is a devastating self-inflicted wound for the alternative media.While it s true that sites like Reddit and Twitter could cite the 1996 Communications Decency Act, as a protection for hosting defamatory information posts by users, there could be real consequences for those deliberately posting defamatory content with no real evidence to substantiate such allegations.Another risk with a whirlwind like this, is that it would be very easy for an agent provocateur to post a slick YouTube video or craft an article   with the intention of whipping-up a storm that could be used to damage independent media as a whole. It s very possible that this has already happened at some point over the life of the internet, and it s certain that the powers that be will use this tactic again in the future.Above all however, it s important to separate the fallout from the pizzagate story and other fake news allegations, as those in mainstream media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and the self-anointed  fact checker Snopes.com, seem to have propped up this pizzeria conspiracy as a battle cry to introduce the idea of new internet censorship protocols.It s anybody s guess what will be the final outcome of the #Pizzagate phenomenon, but for the moment, it seems to have collapsed under the weight of its own mountain of digital ash. Maybe that was the idea.

4783, WATCH: Trump Awkwardly Panders To Empty Black Church So White People Will Vote For Him,"Trump has recently caught on to the fact that there just aren t quite enough angry white guys and open racists to get him elected, and has decided to strike a more moderate tone   sometimes   in an effort to have broader appeal. If you believe the Trump camp, he s honestly trying to court the vote of black Americans. For those of us that weren t born yesterday, it s pretty obvious what the real goal is here: He s trying send a message to the  not racist  white voters at home that it really is morally acceptable to vote for him, promise!And it s pretty obvious black people aren t buying it, either. Trump has made headlines today for a highly publicized photo op at an African-American church ( This is the first African-American church he s been in y all,  Bishop Jackson said, as he introduced him) but apparently, a significant percentage of the congregation stiffed him. There were also protests outside, and inside, the building was nearly empty, as shown in this Tweet by Politico s Shane Goldmacher: Nowhere near a full crowd as Trump enters (far left) pic.twitter.com/kL1AlVukG4  Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) September 3, 2016Even for this photo op, Trump was not fully able to turn the racism off, however. His speech, obviously written by someone else, was full of subdued tones and pandering, but this video clip by ABC News probably sums it up best:  .@realDonaldTrump:  A lot of people don t realize  Abraham Lincoln was a Republican https://t.co/q9Gu8G8cMw https://t.co/i4kQQ7cPF2  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 3, 2016Because if you re black and from Detroit, what are the chances you know anything about American history, amiright?

Westbrook said Trump would struggle to cut into Clinton s overwhelming support among African-Americans.  Her track record is so long with black people,  he said, mentioning her work for children in the 1970s.  Donald Trump hasn t done anything for black people in 30 years. As I said, Trump s not fooling anybody. And to you conservative-leaning white people that aren t racist and have felt better about voting for Trump over the last week of his  outreach,  don t. He s still as racist and repugnant as always, and the fact that his  outreach  has consisted of assuaging the doubts of suburban whites makes his racism insidiously worse than ever.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",trump fact tone effort appeal trump camp court vote yesterday goal message home promise people trump today photo church church bishop percentage congregation building tweet politico crowd trump twitter photo trump racism speech someone video clip news lot people realize news politics anything history trump grave blair head spun sanders trump sale yes anything history lot people realize news politics event article politico church visit chuck resident service tone whisper trump trump support track record people work trump anything people trump anybody people racist trump week outreach racist repugnant fact outreach whites racism image capture
21929,CLOAKED IN CONSPIRACY: Overview of JFK Files Reopens Door to Coup d’état Claims & Cold War Era False Flag Terror,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireSince late October, an ongoing release of intelligence files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy have reignited decades old conspiracy claims. While the material released is reportedly a mix of new and old, some critics have declared that the recently declassified files reveal even more startling evidence regarding the death of 35th president of the United States.Upon reviewing pivotal historical elements linked to the Kennedy assassination, we re told that the vast majority of CIA and FBI records regarding the JFK files have been released, though many are still pending.Despite claims that newly revealed files contain smoking gun evidence in the enigmatic case, the murder of President John F. Kennedy is perhaps an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy and mystery as the controversial case is unlikely to bever e officially reopened during our lifetime.  CLOAKED IN CONSPIRACY    JFK assassination claims have been reignited following the CIA and FBI case record releases. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)NOTE*   While the JFK files have been making their way to The National Archives website since late October, some material released contains names of certain individuals that will remain redacted due to apparent concerns over national security.Although the JFK case is one of America s most compelling conspiracies, it s doubtful that there will ever be complete transparency regarding any information concerning a larger premeditated plot. Among the mountain of theories and credible information concerning the 35th president s assassination, is the likely inclusion of red herrings, false leads, misinformation and media tripwire s that will forever float in the ether of conspiracy realms in an effort to misdirect the public.In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a cloaked wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird. The controversial program infiltrated the American news media in order to influence the public, while also disseminating propaganda through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups.At the start of 2017, more than 12 million declassified documents from the CIA were reportedly published online. While the intelligence docu-dump was believed to have shed additional light on covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, it also contained more evidence confirming the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media.  DARK DAY    The JFK motorcade traveling through Dallas on November 22nd, 1963. Later that fateful day, Kennedy was scheduled to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart. One month earlier, Kennedy had discussed plans to withdraw troops from Vietnam. (Image Source: businessinsider)Over the course of this article, we ll take a look at one of America s most puzzling crimes, while examining some of the most intriguing aspects related to the recently declassified JFK files Guarding the Hen HouseAlthough the CIA s declassified JFK documents offer a window into a web of clandestine operatives, cloaked mafia figureheads and uncanny politically connections at play throughout the tension inducing Cold War era, one should remain skeptical and cautious, as it s very unlikely that any new release would result in a criminal case against the producers of such a large conspiratorial crime, even if such a plot revealed irrefutable evidence.  TRIALS & TRIBULATIONS    After Jim Garrison s case against Shaw, the DA was found not guilty on charges of bribery in a separate trial regarding illegal pinball gambling. Garrison represented himself in 3-hour much ballyhooed closing statement and was easily acquitted on all charges. (Image Source: nola)Moreover, while it s tempting to take the claims of the US intelligence apparatus at face value, an astute observer should tread lightly when viewing any new disclosures related to the JFK assassination.In fact, the very institutions releasing these files today, were at the heart of a controversial investigation conducted by New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison, whose CIA related conspiracy claims regarding President Kennedy s assassination led to charges against a well-known New Orleans businessman and former WW2 military intelligence officer named Clay Shaw. After having been decorated with several prestigious military merits without ever having seen fire in the battlefield   Shaw quickly rose through the ranks of the military, even joining the counterintelligence squad known as the Special Operations Section.Shaw s military pedigree recalls the prototype for modern  Deep State intelligence programs and the formation of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI), an intelligence propaganda agency in 1941 that was succeeded by Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a wartime intelligence apparatus created in 1942 which focused on psychological warfare prior to the formation of the CIA. OSS agents also worked closely with British Security Coordination (BSC). Additionally, the notorious right-wing paramilitary group Organisation arm e secr te (OAS) in France from 1954-1962 had close ties with the CIA through various front organizations connected to the agency.Below is passage concerning the formation of the CIA as illuminated by Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis. Here we see that the inception of the CIA was a direct result of the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, as well as the influence of powerful political US-UK think-tanks coordinating in the background: First, the CIA (preceded by the OSS) was set up as a result of the National Security Act of 1947 [signed] under [Harry S. Truman after the OSS creation by] Franklin D. Roosevelt, springing in part from the Pratt House in New York (future home of the Council on Foreign Relations), itself modelled from the British Secret Intelligence Service.  Likewise, the over-arching institutions that control and run the intelligence agencies in the West, like the Council on Foreign Relations, were modelled on the Oxford Round Table Groups and the Royal Institute for International Affairs. Indeed, the Pratt House s British counterpart was the Chatham House. From America to Europe, the spectre of intelligence operations has loomed large throughout much of the last century and in the suspicious death of JFK, this was never more apparent   CONSPIRATOR?    A brooding Clay Shaw photographed during the JFK assassination trial in 1968. (Image Source: nola)Company Men & SpymastersIn the aftermath of WW2, Shaw was stated to have been officially discharged from military duty. This prompted the published playwright and Chevalier of the Order of the Crown in Belgium (Knight of Malta) to then travel to New Orleans, whereupon he supposedly received support from the entrepreneurial millionaire Theodore Brent, a local businessman known for rail and shipping operations, including the Mississippi Shipping Company, an organization believed to be a CIA intelligence front that allegedly focused on gathering information on Latin America. Incidentally, the former OSS intelligence officer Shaw, held his first post-war position with the Mississippi Shipping Company.In 1943, Brent helped charter the International House with a collection of leaders of commerce, trade and banking insiders. It would become one of two predecessors before the creation of the world s first trade center.In 1947, Shaw became a founder and managing director of International Trade Mart, a New Orleans financial partner housed in a 33-story cross-shaped building that played a large role in international commerce. The  Trade Mart  as it was called, merged with the International House to form the World Trade Center (see left photo) of New Orleans in 1968. Upon the apparent  sponsorship  of the trade center, the group sought to expand trade operations in Basel, Switzerland, a project that was backed by a slew of well-connected financiers that brought to fruition the organization known as Permindex. Over the years, many researchers have examined extremely compelling ties between the CIA and Permindex, as one of the holding company s main backers, a lawyer named Lloyd J. Cobb held a Covert Security Clearance issued by the CIA in October of 1953. In addition, Shaw served on the board of directors at Permindex, as Cobb would later become president of Trade Mart in 1962, providing further evidence of the kind of international reach held by the CIA-linked group of partners. Interestingly, one of the Trade Mart s stated goals would not only be to act as a conduit for foreign trade but the organization would also counter communist propaganda.  This is something that would later fall in line with other CIA-linked operations over that time period.Temple University professor and well-known JFK researcher Joan Mellen, found a number of other links between the CIA and the International Trade Mart that aroused suspicion. Here s a short passage from her book entitled  A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK s Assassination, And the Case That Should Have Changed History: The International Trade Mart was run by CIA operatives, its public relations handled by David G. Baldwin, who would later acknowledge his own  CIA connections.  Baldwin s successor, Jesse Core, was also with the CIA. It was a matter of saving the Agency  shoe leather,  Core would say. The Trade Mart donated money to CIA asset Ed Butler s INCA. Every consulate within its bowels was bugged. Furthermore, not only were Trade Mart and Permindex linked to the CIA   but (see left photo) they were also suspected of ties to organized crime.In March of 1967, according to the Italian newspaper Paese Sera, Permindex was said to have been CIA front for the purposes of political espionage in Europe, including claims that the company took part in an attempted assassination on the French Prime Minister Charles de Gualle alongside the extremist French group OAS in 1961. There were some 30 attempts on de Gaulle s life in the early 1960 s, which many believe was linked to him granting Algeria independence. In 1966, de Gaulle also bucked the established order by withdrawing France from the NATO Military Command Structure. In 1958, after the inception of Permindex, Shaw, along with Cobb and other banking and trade insiders, including David Rockefeller, created a Permindex subsidiary in Rome known as Centro Mondaiale Commerciale (CMC). Permindex/CMC, were later kicked out of Italy due to implications that the CIA front organizations were involved in the subversion of European governments.After Shaw s arrest, Joan Mellen s husband Ralph Schoenman sent the Paese Sera newspaper articles to Garrison from London. The Italian paper according to Mellen, exposed the  CIA s pernicious attempt to influence European electoral politics and thwart the democratic process in more than one country. Adding to that, Mellen explained in her book mentioned above, that the family of former CIA Director of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles (left photo), had been very  interested  in Permindex.  In 2005, Dr. Daniele Ganser stated that a highly secretive CIA-backed paramilitary army was  born out of the head of Allen Dulles  in his seminal book,  NATO s Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.  According Ganser s research, documents revealed that the CIA s covert armies were used to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era strategy of tension. As the former Swiss Director of the OSS, Dulles, had a tainted past tied to a program which sought to assimilate Nazi scientists into America after WW2 under the code name Operation Paperclip. A decade later in 1953, Dulles as head of the CIA approved $1 million dollars in the lead up to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in what became known as Operation Ajax (aka the TPAJAX project). One year later, in 1954, he was the mastermind of a Guatemalan coup.In the aftermath of the JFK assassination, Dulles would be appointed as one of a seven member panel on the controversial Warren Commission headed by fellow Freemason Chief Justice Earl Warren. Rather intriguingly, David Talbot s book entitled  The Devil s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America s Secret Government,  recently raised more questions concerning the potential role played by Dulles in the death of Kennedy.During the Dulles era as CIA chief, Shaw s served as an informant in the CIA s Domestic Contacts Service throughout 1948-1956. Given Shaw s extensive military intelligence background, it stands to reason any connection to the CIA would have been extremely significant.Prior to the formation of the top-secret project QKENCHANT in 1952, Shaw was granted a  five-agency  clearance in 1949. According to FOIA documents obtained by the Mary Ferrell Foundation,  Subject [Shaw] was granted a Provisional Security Approval for use under Project QKENCHANT on an unwitting basis on 10 December 1962.  The  Agency project QKENCHANT was allegedly used to grant security approvals to  non-Agency personnel,  along with closely tied entities for the purpose of proposing future projects, activities and the formation of new relationships. Interestingly, project QKENCHANT also used the services of another individual swirling in the JFK assassination stratosphere named E. Howard Hunt. Years later, the former CIA operative and White House aide Hunt, would become a well-known name as he was tagged as one of five Watergate burglars that stained the Nixon administration after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The list of additional accomplices included three other apparent anti-communist Cuban exiles, along with G. Gordon Liddy, and James McCord who would also be implicated in the  White House Plumbers  plot.In 2007, although Hunt declined direct participation, he released a 2004 controversial confession that suggested he played a  benchwarmer  role in the plot to kill Kennedy. While Hunt s apparent allegations caused quite a stir, he fingered several suspected plotters such as the anti-Castro Frank Sturgis and Cuban exile leader of Alpha 66, Antonio Veciana, a man who claims to have  inadvertently  witnessed a meeting with the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald before Kennedy s death.In Michael Benson s  Who s Who in the JFK Assassination: An A to Z Encyclopedia,  according to Garrison, CMC represented the paramilitary right in Europe, along with the  Italian fascists, American CIA and other interests.  Here s a compelling passage from Benson s book that links CMC, Permindex, the CIA and organized crime: According to evidence in the WC [Warren Commission] hearings, Permindex was suspected of funding political assassinations and laundering money for organized crime. Shaw was also on the board of directors for Permindex s sister corporation, Centro Mondaiale Commerciale CMC.Benson s book also cites other well researched claims regarding CMC and the apparent money laundering of their liquid assets. According to a 1958 State Department document, the CMC, the World Trade Center of Rome, was indeed modeled after the CIA-created Trade Mart in New Orleans.More recently, important  groundbreaking  documents associated with the construct of CMC were unearthed in 2016 by the Italian journalist Michele Metta.According to well-known researcher and writer Jim Marrs a tangled web of intelligence operations linked to Permindex and CMC were further described in his book entitled  Cross Fire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy. Below is a revealing passage from the seminal JFK researcher: The Trade Mart was connected with the Centro Mondaiale Commerciale CMC through yet another shadowy firm named Permindex (Permanent Industrial Expositions), also in the business of international expositions. Continuing, Cross Fire exposed other suspicious intelligence links: The Italian media reported that [Ferenc] Nagy was president of Permindex and the board chairman and major stockholder was Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield a powerful Montreal lawyer who represented the Bronfmans, a Canadian family made wealthy by the liquor industry, as well as serving US intelligence services. Reportedly Bloomfield established Permindex in 1958 as part of the creation of worldwide trade centers connected with CMC. As reported in investigative work by David Goldman and Jeffery Steinberg in 1981, Bloomfield was stated to have been recruited to be part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) in 1938. later the Montreal lawyer obtained an official rank in the US Army, OSS intelligence and the FBI s counterespionage  Division Five  unit as confirmed by Marrs. Additionally, Bloomfield held close ties with Master Mason FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Tibor Rosenbaum, a head of finance for Israeli intelligence.Further conspiratorial claims would be levied on Rosenbaum s Geneva-based Banque de Credit International (BCI), a Mossad-linked bank that allegedly laundered Permindex money to finance assassination attempts on de Gaulle. BCI was also the predecessor to the scandal plagued Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) that was later found to be peddling in terror funding, arms deals and prostitution. BCCI would later be implicated in the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee report called The BCCI Affair. In 1974, Rosenbaum himself was said to have owed BCI some $60 million after his business associate Baron Edmond de Rothschild of the Israel Corporation, discovered an apparent an open and shut case of unauthorized conversion of company funds,  that were transferred to the insolvent Inter Credit Trust of Vaduz instead of BCI.

(Image Source: neworleanspast)The Dallas Plot & The Cuban ProjectIn March of 1967, Garrison, the ex-FBI agent turned DA, indicted Shaw on conspiracy charges related to the assassination of President Kennedy. It would take 22 months before the court proceedings would begin in a trial which lasted 34 days. Aspects of the Shaw trial became popularized following Oliver Stone s much debated and controversial thriller entitled JFK (1991).At the start of the trial in 1969, Garrison s opening statement contended that Shaw, a man believed to have used the alias known as  Clay Bertrand  (also Clem) within the New Orleans socialite scene and gay underground, was also a well-connected former military intelligence officer with no formal background in trade that allegedly participated in a plot to kill the 35th president of the United States. Garrison would further assert that Shaw met with a former US Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and an airline pilot for Eastern Airlines, David Ferrie on several occasions over the summer of 1963, eventually culminated in a meeting at Ferrie s New Orleans apartment where Garrison s star-witness a 25-year-old insurance salesman for Equitable Life Assurance Society named Perry Raymond Russo, apparently overheard the men discussing critical details regarding a JFK assassination plot in September of 1963.Below is screen shot depicting a portion of a NY Times article discussing Russo s testimony of the JFK plot Russo s account of what happened was a major part of the trial and has been one of the most controversial aspects of Garrison s case against Shaw ever since. Over the years, researchers and mainstream critics have debated the credibility of Russo after receiving hypnosis prior to his testimony.JFK case critics believe that due to the combination of the credibility of witnesses called into question, the possibility of planted witnesses and the untimely deaths of some 18 material witnesses, including the controversial death of Ferrie, who was not able to be deposed, Shaw was acquitted in 54 minutes in the only JFK assassination case to make it to trial.A documentary entitled  The JFK Assassination; The Jim Garrison Tapes  discusses many of the  controversial elements of the Shaw trial and its aftermath Interestingly, the demanding trial would include some surprising moments based on witness testimony, as well as the shocking Abraham Zapruder footage which was viewed publicly for the first time before the jury. Moreover, it would later be revealed that the apparent dressmaker Zapruder, had his own links to a CIA front organization as he was stated to have been a member of the Dallas Council on World Affairs. Another fellow member of the council orbiting around the JFK plot, was petroleum engineer George Serguis de Mohrenschildt. Mohrenschildt s ties didn t end there, as he apparently worked out of a CIA-trust building and had befriended Oswald in the summer of 1962. It would later be revealed that Mohrenschildt exchanged letters with Texas oilman and Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) some seven months before the JFK assassination and that he knew George Bush Sr since 1942. Surely, these high level links to CIA and top-ranking officials tracing back to Oswald were not just a coincidence. The whole episode appears to have been echoed two decades later, as a Bush/Hinckley family nexus was exposed following an attempt to assassinate the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.While many mainstream accounts support a Fidel Castro theory in the death of Kennedy due to the apparent assassination attempts on his life, its important to note the massive CIA influence in Cuba. According to Cuban-born American historian and writer Servando Gonzalez, Castro himself had ties to the Council on Foreign Relations and was really a form of controlled opposition. Furthermore, when concerning a larger conspiracy revolving around Cuba, one should consider the political backdrop   on one hand there was the possibly designed to fail CIA-backed  Bay of Pigs  invasion which set the stage for Operation Mongoose, a clandestine program overseen by the CIA, the US State Department (DOS) and the Department of Defense (DoD). Mongoose made use of the anti-Castro Oswald-CIA-mafia-linked Ferrie, along with Cuban exiles in order to sabotage the Castro regime. Additionally, waiting in the wings was the top-secret proposal called Operation Northwoods, a particularly subversive false flag program that included plots of hijacked planes, the bombing of a US ship, a virulent communist Cuban terror campaign in US cities and manufacturing the  real or simulated  deaths of Cuban refugees.In April of 1961, US planning for the Cuban Project aka Operation Mongoose began and was to stated to have been led by Air Force General Edward Lansdale, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and others. The all-encompassing covert war program (seen in part in the image below) would be set in motion to subvert the Cuban regime by October 1962. Underneath the network of Operation Mongoose, there were 33 proposed plans (including Operation Northwoods) designed specifically to be used as a pretext to invade Cuba.The Northwoods false flag operation drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and signed off on by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer was ultimately rejected by Kennedy. However, the declassified files related to the operation are still shocking 55 years later, as the program considered creating  funerals for mock victims, for one of the various plots, as well as produce  casualty lists in US newspapers,  in order to  cause a helpful wave of indignation,  as another plot would reveal where  Soviet bloc incendiaries could be found, after a night of cane-burning in Cuba.This was all said to be happening as President Kennedy was stated to have quietly been working to negotiate through  back channels  with Castro. October of 1962 ushered in the  Cuban Missile Crisis a tense escalation during the Cold War that culminated in Soviet nuclear missiles being placed in Cuba to prevent an invasion. During this time, all Mongoose related operations were halted, as US intelligence apparently failed to warn the Kennedy administration of the Soviet military aid.One could contend that the entirety of Mongoose PSYOP used to cast blame on Cuba was a precursor for future nation building projects that have also unfairly manipulated the public in the wake of alleged mass trauma.  PATSY?    Many researchers believe that the alleged lone gunman in the JFK assassination was an intelligence linked operative who used the alias, Alek Hidell.  (Image Source: pinterest)Covert Operators, the Mafia & NATO s False FlagsAs the identity of Oswald has been shrouded in mystery and manipulation, one is reminded of his  Fair Play for Cuba Committee housed at 544 Camp Street in the very same building of Guy Banister, ex-FBI agent turned private investigator, whose office was at 531 Lafayette Street, just around the corner from Oswald s office in the now demolished Newman building. Incidentally, Banister was stated to have been linked to the FBI s Hoover, while maintaining a front investigative firm that included the CIA operative Ferrie, who reportedly had very close ties to one of the country s most powerful mafia bosses, Carlos Marcello of New Orleans. According to a Washington Post article from 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations believed that Banister s private detective agency was a cover for his role as go-between for the CIA and the Cuban exiles involved in anti-Castro operations.  Additionally, Banister and Ferrie were reportedly engaged in a gun-running operation for Cuban commandos, as the building became headquarters for anti-Castro groups. A decade after the assassination and Shaw trial, CIA operative William Gaudet claimed to have seen Banister with Oswald in a garage near the Camp Street offices. Banister was also found to have ties to the extremist French group OAS.Interestingly, both Oswald and Ferrie operated offices out of the 544 Camp Street address. This meant that the apparently pro-Castro Oswald group operated directly next to Ferrie s anti-Castro activities. The absurdity of this revelation is still as potent today as it was in the late 1960 s. Furthermore, the Post article mentioned above, explained that  Banister s Camp Street office was surrounded by Cuban-exile organizations, including at one point the Cuban Revolutionary Council, a CIA front group set up by, among others, Antonio de Varona, the Cuban exile leader. Rather intriguingly, the Warren Commission would conclude that no one could connect Oswald to 544 Camp Street. This would directly contradict the FBI s own pre-assassination file which had already conclusively linked Oswald to the well-known Camp Street address.Even though allegedly avowed Marxist Oswald operated the pro-Castro  Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the group was later suspected to be an intelligence  cover  designed to further the pursuits of the anti-Castro movement. This something which fell in line with the  rabidly anti-Communist,  CIA-linked Ferrie, a person with a sordid past and lengthy history of sexual abuse from his time in priesthood as well as aeronautics.It was later publicly acknowledged that Ferrie first met Oswald while instructing a small squadron at Moisant Airport from June to September 1955. This contradicted Ferrie, who denied knowing Oswald after the Kennedy assassination. The 15-year-old Oswald joined Ferrie s squadron on July 27, 1955.  COLLABORATORS?    The Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie seen together with a flight squad at Moisant Airport. (Image source: meandlee)NATO s paramilitary-style stay-behind-armies are stated to have been comprised the CIA-linked Operation GLADIO. The origins of GLADIO have been well documented and the secretive counterintelligence operation has been linked to a wave of right-wing  false flag  terror attacks across Europe throughout the 1950 s into the 1980 s. The anti-communist organizational designs were directly connected to that of the CIA and MI6 in particular, with the US and British special forces reportedly facilitating the training.QUESTION: Did Permindex/CMC, along with NATO intelligence, also play a part in facilitating the efforts of Operation GLADIO?When you consider the time frame of  Stay Behind  operations already in existence since 1952, it seems likely that the CIA would make use of its various front organizations to supply the means to produce such covert operations. This is further bolstered by the fact that in 1956, the same year Permindex became operational in Switzerland, Prime Minister of Hungary Ferenc Nagy, who is documented to have been a CIA asset, had gone to Germany and Switzerland on the heels of the apparently CIA influenced Hungarian Revolution. It s worth noting that Nagy was also said to have served on the board of directors at Permindex.According to noted writer and researcher Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under Ronald Reagan s administration, JFK was unaware of the CIA-NATO terror related activities of Operation GLADIO. Here s a passage from that report by Roberts below: President John F. Kennedy had experienced in the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer a high level of insubordination. Lemnitzer showed in White House meetings contempt for the president. When Lemnitzer brought Kennedy the Northwoods Project to shoot down American citizens in the streets of America and to blow American airliners out of the sky in order to place the blame on Castro so that the US could invade and achieve  regime change,  a popular term of the George W. Bush regime, in Cuba, President Kennedy removed Lemnitzer as chairman and sent him to Europe as head of NATO.Kennedy did not know about Operation Gladio, an assassination program in Europe run by NATO and the CIA. Communists were blamed for Operation Gladio s bombings of civilians in train stations in order to erode communist political influence, especially in Italy. Thus, Kennedy s way of getting rid of Lemnitzer put Lemnitzer in charge of this program and gave Lemnitzer a way to get rid of John Kennedy. The article also provides a plausible explanation for the assassination of JFK s brother Robert after he won the Democratic party primary in California in June of 1968. It appears according to Roberts, that RFK might have known about the assassins interwoven into the fabric of the intelligence-crime syndicate shaped and organized by military-linked men, those in high level security operations and those connected to the mafia that played a role in JFK s death. Roberts suggests that RFK was seeking higher office to potentially hold those involved accountable for their crimes against America and his brother, the 35th president of the United States.From this, we can view global operations like GLADIO in addition to the post-9/11  War On Terror  security surge as a form of  power politics  used to aggressively influence the foreign policy of other nations through the use of covert militarization.Lets take a look at some of the records related to the latest CIA and FBI releases in 2017 worth examining in one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century Below is a screen capture of one CIA document that discussed a dinner sponsored by Oren Fenton Potito, an individual listed as a President of the Eastern Synod of Christian Identity and an organizer of the National States  Rights Party (NSRP), who also happened to be a member of the Klu Klux Klan (KKK). In the now declassified document, Potito acknowledged an association between Lee Harvey Oswald and a man identified as Ruby, formally Rubenstein, otherwise known Jack Ruby. Interestingly, both Oswald and Ruby had ties to the Marcello crime family.Another revelation in the memo below added to already existing expert testimony concerning the probability of multiple shooters on November 22nd, 1963 It s worth noting that both NSRP and the KKK were both heavily infiltrated by the FBI s COINTELPRO program, a counter-intelligence program that was specifically designed to influence, disrupt, coerce and discredit political factions from the inside out. The secretive FBI program infiltrated both left and right-wing political groups across America from 1956-1971. Moreover, the controversial program influenced, radicalized and neutralized political dissidents through the use of divisive tactics such as Bad-Jacketing, a technique which manufactured false evidence, fear and rumors regarding various activists. Since NSRP and the KKK were FBI infiltrated groups, it is much more likely that anyone associated with Potito would have already been well-known to authorities.In essence, the document pictured above provides more evidence that Oswald was in reality a known wolf   one who is still without a clear motive in the crime of which he was accused.In October of 2017, another controversial nugget in the JFK files was a memo written by FBI Director Hoover after Oswald was shot by Ruby. The memo revealed that the head of FBI was concerned that the bureau needed to  convince  the public that Oswald acted alone in the Kennedy assassination. A portion of Hoover s memo read The thing I am concerned about, and so is Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin. Other intriguing aspects included in the recent releases concerned the informant status of Dallas police officer J.D Tippit and his alleged involvement in the Kennedy assassination as a trigger man. According to the official narrative Tippit was shot by Oswald 45 minutes after Kennedy s homicide, but the newly circulated memo states that Tippit met with Oswald and Ruby at a nightclub a week prior to the shooting.An additional memo released suggested that the UK s Cambridge News received a warning call 25 minutes prior to JFK s death. This information was written in a memo by then FBI Deputy Director James Angleton to Hoover. However, since this story was made public in late October, Cambridge News has denied  that the tip-off ever occurred. Other JFK file details suggest a US plan to create a false flag scenario using Soviet planes to carry out attacks.In Summary There s been a host of characters and Deep State actors that have an uncanny connection surrounding a swirling conspiracy in JFK s death and this article covers only a fraction of the overwhelming intelligence backdrop associated with the case, not to mention the highly suspicious forensic elements involved in the shooting itself. While varying theories in the JFK murder plot have implicated everyone from the CIA to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), to lurking spymasters, crime bosses and oil barons to pro-Castro Cubans, to Cuban exiles and trade executives   one thing is clear, due to its own compromising alliances, elements within the US government deliberately stonewalled convincing and credible information prudent to the American people regarding the now mythic case.Moreover, the symbolic nature of JFK s violent end, along with the establishment s masking of Oswald s intelligence links to high-ranking officials and other syndicate members perpetually forces the American to people to relive the ritualistic trauma of that dark November day on a time loop without any true resolution.The further one digs into America s seedy underworld of organized crime, intelligence operations, unlikely coincidences and covert relationships concerning the mysterious plot to kill Kennedy, a highly intricate web of activity emerges that points to a compelling case beyond almost any other modern-day conspiracy.*** 21WIRE associate editor Shawn Helton is a researcher and writer, specializing in forensic analysis of high-profile crime scene and counter terrorism investigations, and the deconstruction and analysis of the mass-media coverage surrounding those cases.

640, Trump Loves To Say The New York Times Is ‘Failing’ – So They Just Effortlessly Embarrassed Him With Simple Numbers,"Print journalism and longstanding papers have been struggling since the advent of the internet and increased competition faced by blogs and op-ed sites. That, combined with poor understanding of marketing on new platforms, has combined to really cause a struggle in the journalism industry.So, on a certain level, journalists can thank Trump. Despite unleashing a war on freedom of the press never before seen in our nation s history, he s been a boon to business, with massive public backlash against Trump and his fake news army resulting in a thirst for facts and information.Take the New York Times, for example. In the first quarter of 2017, the NYT signed on more new subscribers than any other period in history. Stock is up 50 percent. Digital advertising revenue went up nearly 20 percent. So when Donald Trump says  when is the failing NYT going to go out of business,  as he did today, the answer is  not soon.  They ve been around for 160 years and don t look to be going anyplace anytime soon.Here s the specific tweet in question:How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017And here s the reply by the New York Times, completely demolishing whatever little remnants of dignity Trump has left at this point:That is incorrect.

975," Dem Rep. Calls Out GOP, Urges More Of Them To Rebuke Sexist Trump (TWEETS)","We all know that Donald Trump is a misogynistic sexual predator. That s the kind of public life he has led, and it is the kind of so-called  presidential  campaign he ran. However, now that he is sitting in the Oval Office and representing America as our Head of State, his words matter. Therefore, his disgusting, sexist attacks on Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski are all the more gravely disturbing. Thankfully, people are calling him out. However, that isn t enough. The entire GOP needs to rebuke Trump for what he is doing on Twitter, and one Democratic Congresswoman is pointing that out, Rep. Barbara Lee of California.Taking to Trump s favorite medium of communication, Twitter, Rep. Lee called on her GOP colleagues to stop excusing Trump s behavior and standing by him, for his words are having a terribly negative impact on the impressionable children of America. Rep. Lee tweeted:I want my GOP colleagues to explain to my 3 granddaughters why they think these viciously sexist comments are acceptable from our President. https://t.co/C0C4GJaYks  Rep.

It s also about the GOP   which continues to defend & support him.  Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) June 29, 2017Then again, the GOP has long been an anti-woman party. It is there in their policies, in their refusal to vote for the protection of domestic violence victims or in favor of equal pay for women, and their constant and unending stream of assaults on women s reproductive healthcare. In a way, that makes Trump the perfect standard-bearer for their party.Besides all of that, the party is largely made up of old, craven, white men, who couldn t care less about the well-being of women.

21033,"OPEN-BORDER LIBERALS Put Entire Nation On High Alert: German Spy Chief Warns 1,000+ Radical Islamists Ready To Attack…Over 100 ISIS Members Among Refugees","Thank you Angela Merkel German security service BfV reportedly received more than 100 tip-offs that ISIS militants had infiltrated the country among refugees, according to a recent report. The news comes as massive nationwide anti-terror raids took place this week.The head of the German domestic intelligence service (BfV), Hans-Georg Maassen, told a gathering of politicians that the agency had received more than 100 warnings indicating there were Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants staying in Germany as refugees, newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported Friday, without citing its sources.However , some cases of  baseless defamation  were among those tip-offs, Maassen added, according to the newspaper.German security services have remained on high alert since the November terror attacks in Paris which claimed the lives of more than 130 people.Earlier this week, police and security agents all across Germany were scrambled to search for suspects allegedly planning a terror attack in the country, with Berlin seen as the most likely target. Well-known tourist attractions including Alexanderplatz train station and the Cold War-era Checkpoint Charlie could be among the targets of a possible attack, according to preliminary media reports.On Thursday, a police special force unit raided four flats and two businesses in Berlin, detaining four men accused of allegedly having ties to Islamic State. They were suspected of being involved in planning an attack, police spokesman Martin Redlich told RT.German spy chief warns of 1,000+ radical Islamists ready to attack https://t.co/VZn1xRA2oA pic.twitter.com/BlxXGGXHkK  RT (@RT_com) December 13, 2015One of the suspects, a 49-year-old Algerian, was arrested in a three-bedroom flat in Berlin s predominantly immigrant district of Kreuzberg. He was living there on a fake French passport, local media reported, and owned two shops nearby Alexanderplatz and Checkpoint Charlie. Redlich could not confirm the landmarks were the targets, however.The spokesman said police had acted on a tip-off, but he provided no further details.Similar raids also took place in the German regions of North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. In Berlin alone, 450 police officers were engaged in the operation, German media reported.The main suspect was a 35-year-old Algerian man detained during Thursday s raid in the town of Attendorn. Said to be a possible leader of an IS terrorist cell, he was also being sought by Algerian authorities over allegations he is a member of the terrorist group.He entered Germany in autumn 2015, having traveled the so-called  Balkan route.  At that time, the 35-year-old was registered in Bavaria as a refugee.Both men had been monitored since the end of 2015, after security services had received a tip-off they might be IS infiltrators.Another unnamed 26-year-old Algerian, who also registered as a refugee and lived in a shelter in central Hannover, is suspected by the police to be the cell s communication agent. He is also thought to have possible ties to Belgian Islamists. He has traveled to the Molenbeek district of Brussels, known for harboring jihadists, at least once in recent weeks. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind behind the November s Paris attacks, was a Molenbeek resident.Germany took in over 1.1 million refugees in 2015, and fifty-four percent of Germans believe the terror threat in the country is on the rise because of the high number of incoming migrants, according to the latest Spiegel poll.

21132,MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AFFILIATE INVITED To Obama’s State Of The Union…Will This Terror Group Also Be Invited?,"So in an effort to reach out to Muslims living in America, we need to invite groups that are tied to terrorists? Why stop at groups like CAIR? Why not invite ISIS? Perhaps we missed it, but we haven t seen the list of prominent Christian leaders invited to Obama s SOTU, who will represent the worldwide mass persecution of Christians As many as 25 House Democrats are expected to have Muslim guests during Tuesday night s State of the Union speech. It s in response to a call from Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim voted into Congress, to counter an  alarming rise in hateful rhetoric against Muslim Americans and people of the Islamic faith worldwide. The gesture might not generate much more than a shrug, except that in at least two cases, Democrats invited officials from a group the FBI formally avoids due to historic ties to a Hamas support network.Delray Beach Rep. Alcee Hastings invited Nezar Hamze, regional operations director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Florida. And San Jose, Cal. Rep. Zoe Lofgren invited Sameena Usman, a 10-year veteran government relations official with CAIR s San Francisco chapter, the Investigative Project on Terrorism has learned.CAIR officials routinely accuse federal law enforcement of entrapping otherwise innocent and peaceful Muslims in order to gin up terrorism prosecutions. Hamze s colleagues in CAIR-Florida are helping a family sue the FBI over the 2013 fatal shooting of a terror suspect who attacked agents after extensive questioning. Usman s office published a notorious poster urging Muslims to  Build a Wall of Resistance [and] Don t Talk to the FBI.  For its part, the FBI cut off contact with CAIR, except in investigations, in 2008 based on evidence its agents uncovered which placed CAIR in a Hamas-support network in the United States. Until it can be shown that those connections no longer exist, an FBI official explained in 2009, CAIR is not  an appropriate liaison partner. In addition, several CAIR officials have compared Israel to ISIS.Calls to press contacts in Lofgren and Hastings  offices were not returned Monday.Last month, the IPT provided exclusive details from eyewitness accounts about CAIR s creation, including an account of how a co-founder sought approval from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood for CAIR s bylaws, and how Executive Director Nihad Awad s move to Washington was  in order to represent Hamas. Hastings and Lofgren either failed to check out their guests  employer or they don t care. These connections have nothing to do with the faith of CAIR officials. But the organization has a record that elected officials stubbornly insist should be ignored. Unfortunately, this is part of a pattern of outreach House Democrats seek out with the wrong people. Last month, CAIR-Florida s Hassan Shibly was invited to the White House for a discussion about religious discrimination. Then, as with the State of the Union speech, no one from the new Muslim Reform Movement   which issued a declaration clearly rejecting  interpretations of Islam that call for any violence, social injustice and politicized Islam  and standing for  peace, human rights and secular governance.

6754, Watch: Obama Forced To Reassure U.K. That Republicans Haven’t Completely Ruined United States Yet,"In yet another unforced error committed by the Republican Party that hurts America s reputation, the recent surge in discriminatory laws against the LGBT community has caused alarm to the rest of the world. The U.K. even issued a travel alert to its citizens warning them of the risk of vacationing in places like North Carolina and Mississippi, given the new so-called  bathroom laws  and other forms of legislated bigotry. The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,  the advisory stated.  LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before traveling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. The advisory encouraged travelers to avoid potentially risky situations and  excessive physical shows of affection,  and to  exercise discretion  in rural areas.President Obama, who happens to be in London, was forced yet again to play  only adult in the room  and reassure the international community that Republican laws, while particularly nasty, haven t made the United States a nightmarish hellscape, and that most people, including residents in those states, want absolutely nothing to do with the Republican Party s brash forms of discrimination. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people in North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people, they are hospitable people, they are beautiful states and you are welcome. You should come and enjoy yourselves. I think you ll be treated with extraordinary hospitality. Taking a moment to get a bit more personal, Obama said that he found the laws to be absurd, hateful and contrary to the values of America. I also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned and they re in response to politics in part and some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people.

This has never once happened. The law, instead, opens up members of the trans community to further harassment, violence, and stigmatization.Most Americans seem aware of this and protests against the bathroom bills have become widespread. In North Carolina, the state is hemorrhaging millions of dollars a month in lost business and boycotts while the Republican governor and legislature stubbornly refuse to concede that this plan was based on little more than ignorance and hate. In South Carolina, a similar bill was quickly killed in a desperate effort to avoid becoming the next North Carolina.Meanwhile, the president is forced to explain and defend America s pathetic treatment of its LGBT community, because his opposition in the Republican Party would rather focus on bullying trans people than address things like climate change, wealth inequality, healthcare reform or immigration.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 22, 2016",error party reputation surge community alarm rest world travel alert risk bathroom bigotry society towards people country legislation please travel advice community affection discretion president adult room community people nothing party brash discrimination everybody kingdom people people people hospitality moment bit response politics part people people people miss bathroom response child access law community harassment violence stigmatization bathroom state millions month lost business governor legislature refuse plan ignorance hate bill effort president treatment community opposition party people climate change wealth inequality reform immigration image twitter

8007, Bernie Sanders Literally Laughs At Stupidity Of Fox News Trying To Explain Taxes (VIDEO),"Sometimes all you can do is laugh at the stupidity of Fox News, which is exactly what Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders just did when discussing taxes for the wealthy and ridiculous wealth inequality.The Democratic presidential candidate appeared on Fox News with Chris Wallace this past Sunday, and one of the things that the Fox host tried to grill Sanders on was to question the claim that the economy is  rigged  for the one percent.Wallace tried to make his point by pointing out that in 1981 the top one percent paid 17% of all federal income taxes, as compared to now where they pay 37%. However, he clearly doesn t understand math, which actually falls right into Sanders  argument that the system is, in fact, rigged for the very wealthy to keep getting wealthier without paying their fair share of taxes.Wallace asks Sanders: If the wealthy have rigged the system, why have they done such a lousy job of it? This is when Bernie literally laughs out loud and responds to the condescending Wallace: Ohhh, Chris. I think you re missing the major point here, and that is, what we have seen in recent years is a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent whose percentage of wealth in America has doubled. We re talking about trillions of dollars going from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent. Wallace then tries to blame President Obama, because of course, but Sanders responds: These are policies that have gone on for a long long time under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. Now, are we better off today than we were when President Bush left office and we were losing 800,000 jobs a month? Of course we are. But for the last 40 years what we have been seeing is a middle class disappearing, people working longer hours for low wages, and today, as it happens, 58% of all new income is going to the top one percent. That s a rigged economy to my mind, Chris. And if they are earning 58% of all new income, they should be paying 58% of all tax revenue, but they re not. The system is rigged for them to get away with paying less and less with a lower tax burden due to loopholes and deductions those who make FAR less don t get the opportunity to take advantage of.Sanders is exactly right, and good for him for laughing in the face of Fox News.

22159,Why Has Donald Trump Abandoned the Foreign Policy That Won Him the Election?,"21st Century Wire says President Trump is drifting further into Neoconservative land, and very soon there will be no turning back.Although you wouldn t know it from the US media blackout   the US has quietly deployed upwards of 4,000 combat troops in Syria   in total violation of both US and international law.Upon closer examination, however, Trump s foreign policy is fast resembling Israel s foreign policy.This is exactly what candidate Trump promised he wouldn t do  Doug Bandow The National InterestCandidate Donald Trump offered a sharp break from his predecessors. He was particularly critical of neoconservatives, who seemed to back war at every turn.Indeed, he promised not to include in his administration  those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.  And he s generally kept that commitment, for instance rejecting as deputy secretary of state Elliot Abrams, who said Trump was unfit to be president.Substantively candidate Trump appeared to offer not so much a philosophy as an inclination. Practical if not exactly realist, he cared more for consequences than his three immediate predecessors, who had treated wars as moral crusades in Somalia, the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. In contrast, Trump promised:  unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. Yet so far the Trump administration is shaping up as a disappointment for those who hoped for a break from the liberal interventionist/neoconservative synthesis.The first problem is staffing. In Washington people are policy. The president can speak and tweet, but he needs others to turn ideas into reality and implement his directives. It doesn t appear that he has any foreign policy realists around him, or anyone with a restrained view of America s international responsibilities.Rex Tillerson, James Mattis and H. R. McMaster are all serious and talented, and none are neocons. But all seem inclined toward traditional foreign policy approaches and committed to moderating their boss s unconventional thoughts. Most of the names mentioned for deputy secretary of state have been reliably hawkish, or some combination of hawk and centrist Abrams, John Bolton, the rewired Jon Huntsman Continue this story at The National InterestREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"March 20, 2017",century wire president trump land media upwards combat violation law examination policy policy trump break war turn administration responsibility history war commitment instance deputy secretary state trump president trump philosophy inclination practical contrast trump presidency war aggression administration disappointment break interventionist synthesis problem people policy president reality policy anyone view none policy boss deputy secretary state combination hawk centrist huntsman story news century wire trump work member
8984, John Oliver Has Brilliant Advice For Breaking That New Year’s Resolution You Won’t Keep Anyway (VIDEO),"It s a new year. For many of us, that means that we probably made a few resolutions. You know   quit smoking, eat better, drink less, get more sleep   all good things that could improve life. There s just one problem, though: most people don t keep those resolutions. They go right out the window before the first month of the new year is even over for most people. Well, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight has some advice in that arena: You re going to break these resolutions anyway, so quit being so hard on yourself.Oliver said: Every December, for some reason, we decide that next year will be the one that everything turns around and we ll finally quit drinking, or learn how to pronounce the name of these berries.  He then continued: But let s be honest, we re a few days into the new year now, and if you haven t broken your New Year s resolutions yet, statistically you are about to. That can be depressing. But don t panic, all hope is not lost. Because the key thing with resolutions is not how to keep them   it s how to revise them once you ve failed. The main problem with New Year s resolutions is that we set our expectations way too high. For instance, lots of people say they want to exercise more   but that s hard. Exercise is like reading for your muscles. Except you can t watch a movie of someone else exercising and basically get the gist of it. He s right. Humans are set in our ways. Small changes are better than big ones, because they are easier to stick to. You re not going to change your whole life just because a new year rolls in, and that really is okay.Watch Oliver s hilarious  yet completely accurate   thoughts on New Year s resolutions below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 4, 2016",year eat drink life problem people window month year people host week tonight advice arena reason year everything drinking name days year year panic hope thing problem year way instance lots people exercise movie someone gist ways life year watch year image video capture story
1352, Ben Carson Believes Poverty Is Just A ‘State Of Mind’ And People Aren’t Happy About It,"Ben Carson, the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has come under fire for comments he made during a radio interview on Tuesday when he called poverty a  state of mind  live on air. A statement like that would be quite low coming from anyone, but it takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from the lips of the man who oversees the department that handles housing for millions of low-income Americans.The statement was made when Carson was being interviewed by conservative media personality and personal friend, Armstrong Williams. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, has dealt directly with poverty himself and credits his mother for getting his family out of that situation, but that didn t stop him from implying that some people are just poor because they have a negative outlook on life.According to a transcript of the interview with Williams that was released on Wednesday, Carson didn t shy away from making his feelings on the subject known.  I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind,  he said.  You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they ll be right back up there. But he didn t stop there, adding that lending a helping hand to those in need may not even improve their lives if they don t have the right mental attitude, thus there s really no point in trying.  You take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world   they ll work their way right back down to the bottom,  he continued, strong words coming from the man who is in charge of trying to keep roofs over the heads of those not exactly living in the lap of luxury.Not every low-income earner is presented with the same opportunities as Carson s mother, but in his opinion, that shouldn t even factor into the equation.  If everybody had a mother like mine, nobody would be in poverty,  Carson said.  She was a person who absolutely would not accept the status of victim. Naturally, Twitter exploded after the release of the transcript on Wednesday, as Twitter tends to do, with everyone from former Barack Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett to beloved Star Trek actor and human rights activist George Takei weighing in on Carson s comments.Poverty is a state of mind Ben Carson?

840, Republicans Go Back To Basics: ‘Stop Asking About Russia Or We’ll Investigate Hillary Again!’,"House republicans have vowed to fight fire with fire, with Steve King, Republican Representative from Iowa, stating that they are willing to begin a new investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails unless Democrats stop fanning the flames of the scandal involving the President Trump s potential collusion with Russia during his election campaign. If this continues this immobilization of the presidency over these kind of things it s gonna force Congress to do an investigation, a complete and thorough investigation, and that means go back all the way to the 650,000 emails of Anthony Weiner and look at [former FBI Director James] Comey and his activities,  King told CNN s Alisyn Camerota.When pressed by Camerota to elaborate farther, King went as far as to paint Comey and the special counsel burdened with the task of investigating Trump s possible Russia ties as the ones that are truly guilty of collusion. What I m saying is this, that the Comey investigation now him picking the special counsel on top of it on its face, appears to be collusion,  King added, however, there s just one small problem with that statement  Special Counsel Robert Mueller wasn t appointed by James Comey, rather by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.This has been a common pattern by the Republican party when dealing with any controversy or scandal involving the President during his six-month tenure in power; just try and distract the media as well as the public from the real issues at hand by trying to create new ones involving Hillary Clinton s campaign.This very technique was what they turned to in May during a Senate hearing that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; rather than focussing on the task at hand, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruise just spent his time asking Clapper about Clinton s emails. Another Texan Republican Senator, John Coryn, did the exact same thing last month during James Comey s Senate testimony. Even Republican Senator Lindsay Graham from South Carolina recently told Fox News that now that Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump, Congress should ditch their own investigations and resume looking into Clinton s emails.It is a simple fall back plan the GOP keep using and it has been reasonably effective. It seems far easier, not to mention extremely more effective, to draw the attention away from your wrongdoings than try to explain or justify them.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"July 17, 2017",house fire fire king representative investigation scandal president trump collusion russia election campaign immobilization presidency kind force congress investigation investigation way look director farther counsel task trump russia collusion investigation counsel top face collusion king problem statement counsel attorney rod pattern party controversy scandal president month tenure power try media public hand campaign technique senate hearing testimony attorney director intelligence task hand senator cruise time clapper senator thing month senate testimony senator graham news president congress fall attention try image

6839," Ted Cruz Is Forced To Explain His Bigotry To Gay Republican On National Television, It Didn’t Go Well (VIDEO)","A gay man cornered Ted Cruz on Monday and the Republican presidential candidate couldn t handle the simple question posed to him.During a forum on ABC s Good Morning America hosted by Robin Roberts, an openly gay Republican restaurant owner concerned about so-called  religious liberty  laws being passed by states like North Carolina and Mississippi asked Cruz how he would protect LGBT people from discrimination if he were to become president. I ve noticed a lot of religious freedom laws and somewhat institutionalized discrimination laws happening around the country. What would you as president do to protect me and my husband?  Todd Calogne directly asked.And Cruz didn t waste time going into spin-mode.The Texas Senator claimed that the anti-LGBT laws  protects everyone  even though they blatantly allow business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees by shielding their bigotry with the Bible under the guise of religious freedom. Religious liberty, it applies to Jews, it applies to Christians, it applies to Muslims, it applies to atheists,  Cruz said even though he has repeatedly stated his intention to violate the religious liberty of Muslims and atheists. Also, being gay isn t a religion, it s a sexual orientation. And all of us, we want to live in a world where we don t have the government dictating our beliefs, dictating how we live,  Cruz continued.  We have a right to live according to our faith, according to our conscience. And we shouldn t have a right to force others to give up their faith and give up their belief. And I think that keeping government out of the way of your lives protects the freedom of every one of us. Cruz dodged Calogne s question but Robin Roberts didn t let him get away with it. A lot of people would say, doesn t everyone have the freedom to be treated equally?  she asked.  Don t we all have the freedom to be equal? Of course we do,  Cruz flat-out lied to the faces of every American watching. Cruz then declared that  the First Amendment protects everyone equally, it protects our faith  before launching into how he intends to push for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which finally gave Calogne the answer he had been waiting for. Under the Constitution, marriage is a question for the states. And so if someone wants to change the marriage laws, I don t think it should be five unelected lawyers down in Washington dictating that. If you want to change the marriage law, convince your fellow citizens to change the laws. In other words, Cruz would NOT protect the rights of gay people as president. He would strip rights from them and treat them like second-class citizens.Here s the video via ABC: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos Religious liberty  laws like those in North Carolina and Mississippi allow anti-gay business owners to openly discriminate against gay people. It s legalized bigotry similar to the kind experienced by black people in the 1960s during segregation.

11073,TIME TO DITCH The United Nations After THIS Outrageous Vote: “Like making an arsonist into the town fire chief”,"We ve written numerous articles on the horrible human rights  record in Saudi Arabia and how the U.S. keeps pushing them as arbiters of great human rights. It s very puzzling!Saudi Arabia is not only horrible when it comes to all human rights, they are especially abysmal when it comes to women s rights (see list below). Electing Saudi Arabia to protect women s rights is like making an arsonist into the town fire chief    Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.So why did the UN just vote to make Saudi Arabia a member of the Women s Rights Commission? The Economic and Social Commission of the United Nations voted for this but it s not clear which countries voted for this because the vote was held behind closed doors.This is one more example of why we need to turn the United Nations building into condos and shut it down!Even Obama s State Department s recent human rights record on Saudi Arabia says that women s rights there remain less than satisfactory:Women continued to face significant discrimination under law and custom, and many remained uninformed about their rights.  The law does not provide for the same legal status and rights for women as for men, and since there is no codified personal-status law, judges made decisions regarding family matters based on their interpretations of Islamic law. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have fewer political or social rights than men, and society treated them as unequal members in the political and social spheres. The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her  guardian  with the legal authority to approve her travel outside of the country. A guardian also has authority to approve some types of business licenses and study at a university or college. Women can make their own determinations concerning hospital care. Women can work without their guardian s permission, but most employers required women to have such permission. A husband who verbally (rather than through a court process) divorces his wife or refuses to sign final divorce papers continues to be her legal guardian. Can you believe it? Women in Saudi Arabia were just allowed to vote! Can you also believe that Saudi Arabia is head of the human rights council at the United Nations even though this barbaric place is one of the biggest human rights offenders around? Yes, the beheadings this year are in record numbers for this barbaric Middle Eastern country. We recently posted rare footage of a tour bus catching a public execution on the side of the road.Oh, the amazing thing is that Saudi Arabia has accepted ZERO refugees except guest workers. They have a tent city set up for millions (yes, millions) but refuse to let the refugees into their country. Human rights my ass!Here are 7 things that women in Saudi Arabia still can t do:1. Go anywhere without a male guardian.Saudi women must accompany a male relative, known as a  mahram , whenever they venture out of the house. Mahram accompanies the women at all times, including for shopping trips and visits to the doctor.2. Drive a car.Although there is no official law that bans women from driving, the country s deeply held religious beliefs prohibit it, with some clerics argue that female drivers  undermine social values. 3. Wear clothes that show off their bodySaudi women s dress code is governed by a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women must wear a long black cloak and a head scarf. Religious police would stop them if they expose too much flesh or wear too much makeup.4. Interact with menSaudi women are expected to limit their interactions with men other than their family members or relatives. The majority of public buildings including offices, banks and universities have separate entrances for men and women. Public transportation, parks, beaches and amusement parks are also segregated in most parts of the country. Unlawful mixing will lead to criminal charges.5. Go for a swimSaudi women are not expected to swim in public swimming pools or used by male members.6. Compete in sportsWomen athletes are looked down upon by the conservative Saudi society. It s generally hard for women to compete freely in sports. Though they are allowed to participate, they had to be accompanied by a male guardian and wear a  Sharia-compliant  sports kit that covered their hair.7. Try on clothes when shoppingSaudi women are not expected to try on clothes while shopping. Doing so, may attract punishment.Via: Zee News IndiaTHOUSANDS SHARED THIS CARTOON SHOWING HOW RIDICULOUS SAUDI LAWS ARE FOR WOMEN: ",politics,"Apr 23, 2017",record arsonist town fire chief executive director watch un vote member commission commission vote example building state department record discrimination law custom law status men status law family law property support men society guardianship system woman relative guardian authority travel country guardian authority business study university college hospital care permission permission husband court process wife divorce guardian head council place year record country footage tour bus execution side road thing city millions millions country ass male venture house times doctor drive car law country clothes code interpretation law cloak head scarf police flesh interact men family majority men transportation amusement country swimming compete upon society sports guardian sports kit hair try clothes clothes punishment zee news cartoon

If you re really not racist then you won t see what he done, what he s doing, as a threat to America, but just addressing a problem that we have,  Lynch said at the time.Raiders coach Jack Del Rio says he didn t know about Lynch s plans ahead of the game, according to NFL.com.

21660,FRANKLIN GRAHAM PULLING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FROM BANK USING TV AD [Video] TO PROMOTE GAY MARRIAGE AND ADOPTION,"The left shouldn t be offended by Graham s decision to do his banking elsewhere since they re all about defending  choice Franklin Graham is calling on Christians to boycott corporations that feature same-sex relationships in their commercials. And he says he ll do his part by moving all the bank accounts for his two ministries out of Wells Fargo because of its ad featuring a lesbian couple. This is one way we as Christians can speak out   we have the power of choice,  Graham wrote on Facebook over the weekend.  Let s just stop doing business with those who promote sin and stand against Almighty God s laws and His standards. Maybe if enough of us do this, it will get their attention. Reached Monday, a spokesperson for Wells Fargo said the bank has proudly supported the LGBT community for a long time   a commitment echoed by the ad. At Wells Fargo, serving every customer is core to our vision and values,  said Christina Kolbjornsen.  Diversity and inclusion are foundational to who we are as a company. Our advertising content reflects our company s values and represents the diversity of the communities we serve. Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, has its largest employee base in the Charlotte area.During an interview Monday, Graham   the CEO of both the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in Charlotte and Samaritan s Purse in Boone   said he was not targeting companies that hire or serve gay and lesbian customers.  There s lots of businesses out there that do business with gay people,  he said.  That s fine. He wants Christians to stop giving their money to businesses, such as Wells Fargo and Tiffany jewelers,  that use shareholders  advertising dollars to promote homosexuality.   It s promoting a godless lifestyle.   A bank should be promoting the best interest rates they re going to give me and what they can do for me as a business. But they should not be trying to get into a moral debate and take sides. Graham specifically objected to a Wells Fargo TV and online ad that features a lesbian couple learning sign language for their adopted daughter.  Hello, beautiful,  the couple in the ad tell the little girl in sign language.  We re going to be your new mommies. Stirring up conservativesGroups representing gays and lesbians charged that Graham was trying to stir up conservative Christians in anticipation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that could legalize same-sex marriage nationally.Graham  is on the quickly losing side of moral history,  said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, a statewide LGBT rights group based in Raleigh.  The business community knows these ads are good for business and good for making North Carolina a welcoming state. They are only going to increase, not decrease. Graham said in Monday s interview with the Observer that a decision has been made about which bank will get the accounts the BGEA and Samaritan s Purse are moving from Wells Fargo. Based on their own reports, the accounts could total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Asked whether he would identify the chosen bank, Graham said:  Not today because I haven t talked to that bank and I m not sure they want to be part of your story. Charlotte-based Bank of America has not yet made commercials featuring same-sex couples, but it has run same-sex ads in programs for some events as well as in LGBT publications. Would that be enough for Graham to rule out Bank of America for the accounts leaving Wells Fargo? I m not going to answer that question,  Graham said.Bank of America spokeswoman Anne Pace declined to comment Monday.For now, Graham said, the closing of the Wells Fargo accounts is  in the works. To close these accounts, it may take 30 days. The BGEA, started by Graham s famous evangelist father, spreads the Gospel via worldwide crusades and Charlotte s Billy Graham Library. In 2014, it received contributions and other income totaling $107.7 million, according to the BGEA s most recent ministry report.Samaritan s Purse, a Christian charity that helps people cope with natural disasters, had contributions and grants in 2013   the most recent report available   that totaled $460 million.Tough questions for banksBanks would usually line up for those kinds of deposits. But Ken Thomas, a Miami-based independent bank consultant and economist, said the bank that receives Graham s bank accounts will have to answer some tough questions. The bank that takes this account will be in a higher visibility position because you re going to ask them,  What do you think of that ad?    And they will face some potential reputation risk. Banks, Thomas said,  don t like controversy, and they don t like reputation risk. Whichever bank receives these accounts will have to combat the perception that they stand counter to the ideals of Wells Fargo. To take your money out of one of the best-run banks in America, and for another bank to accept an account that came out of Wells Fargo, some people might ask questions like,  Does your bank not agree with Wells Fargo?  Thomas said.Corporate America has increasingly come to the defense of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Governors and legislatures in Republican-leaning states such as Indiana and Arkansas retreated this year from legislation that would have permitted people to decline services to gays and lesbians for religious reasons. The reason: corporations in those states opposed the measures as discriminatory against the LGBT community.In North Carolina, a similar bill went nowhere after it was opposed by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and legislative leaders in Raleigh.Leaders of Charlotte s big banks played a visible role going back to the late 1990s on issues involving sexual orientation.Ed Crutchfield s First Union, now part of Wells Fargo, and Hugh McColl s NationsBank, now Bank of America, amended their policies to state that no employee will be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. At that time, many other large companies in the area didn t use such specific language.Also, in the 1998 merger of NationsBank and San Francisco s BankAmerica, which had domestic partner benefits, the combined lender agreed to extend the benefits to NationsBank s employees.Graham said in the Observer interview that he plans to compile and publicize a list of companies that feature same-sex couples in their advertising.  I want people to know,  he said.In his Facebook post, Graham singled out another company   Tiffany & Co., which sells jewelry   for advertising wedding rings for gay couples. There are plenty of other jewelry stores,  Graham wrote.Two others that have featured same-sex couples in their ads: Cheerios and Allstate.Impact unknownIt s too early to determine whether Graham s call for a boycott will have much impact.As of Monday afternoon, more than 93,000 people had approved of Graham s Facebook message by clicking  Like.  More than 41,000 people had shared his message with their own Facebook friends.But Graham s call to  fight the moral decay that is being crammed down our throats by big business  also brought negative reactions on Facebook. In my opinion, moral decay is using the pulpit to spread bigotry and hate,  wrote one Facebook commenter, who then alluded to Jesus  teachings in the New Testament.  Perhaps you should take some time and chip away at that block of wood sticking out of your own eye. On Twitter, where Graham also announced that  we re moving all the @BGEA bank accounts from @WellsFargo to another bank,  he got some supportive tweets.

19305,TRUMP PUT JENNIFER HUDSON And Relatives Up Rent-Free In Trump Towers After Her Family Was Murdered…So Why Isn’t She Performing At His Inauguration?,"In 2008, Jennifer Hudson the  Dream Girls  star and Grammy Award winning 34-year-old singer lost her mother, her brother, and her nephew after her sister s estranged husband shot them in a brutal murder   a topic she rarely talks about now, except in a healing light. She s a great girl. And we re protecting them well,  Trump told PEOPLE at a benefit honoring Australia director Baz Luhrman at the Museum of Modern Art Monday night.  They are very safe. PeopleIn 2008, Hudson performed  Let s Stay Together  for Barack and Michelle Obama during Obama s inauguration ball. It s not clear if Obama and Michelle did anything to help her after her family was murdered.Two days ago, another  Dream Girls  star, Broadway sensation Jennifer Holliday, who had previously committed to performing at Trump s inauguration, backed out over bullying and threats she received from the Left.Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies.  I just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American,  she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black.Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation. It brought a lot of threats from people already saying I ll never work again,  she said.  If that s what America has come to, where we all hate and bully people, there s no more freedom of speech. She added,  I know everybody hates me now, but that shows we are all just hateful people now   we don t even want to work together. Ms. Holliday said she did not see herself, or her singing, as political, a sentiment echoed by Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old classical-crossover singer who will perform the national anthem at Mr. Trump s inauguration on Jan. 20. I just kind of thought that this is for my country,  Ms. Evancho said.  So if people are going to hate on me it s for the wrong reason. Ms. Holliday said her goal is to support America:  Are we saying that if there is anything that could be done for America in four or eight years or however long Trump is there, we re not supposed to participate or help anybody?  she asked.  Shouldn t we all be praying for the success of America? I would like to sing some hope and have my voice not be associated with some kind of label, but I guess that s where we are now.

6552, Sarah Palin Just Sent A Truly Idiotic Message to ‘Smart Democrats’ (VIDEO),"Now that Ted Cruz has dropped out of the presidential race and Donald Trump looks like he s going to be the Republican nominee, Sarah Palin came out in full support   and stupidity   for her favorite candidate.Taking to her Facebook page, Palin made a video where she praised The Donald and thanked his supporters for believing in the disgraced frontrunner. She said: To all of you who believed in making a real difference in our politics and in the way things have been done in the past that have put America in a pretty precarious position. Thank you so much for supporting Trump and believing in this idea of being able to make America great again. We re finally on the road to do so, but we do have to unite first. The former governor of Alaska, who is also the failed GOP vice presidential candidate of 2008, has decided that she s more than qualified to predict the success of a Trump presidency, and has a message for any  smart Democrats  that might be listening. Her advice to them? Unite behind Donald Trump. Addressing  GOP and independents and smart Democrats,  Palin said: Truly it is time to come together, pull together   remember that united we will stand, our country will stand united. Divided, we re going to fall. So now, after participating in some really healthy, kind of arduous competition, and now, more than ever, it s time to come together and put some differences aside. Stand on principle, that principle that, yeah, we have opportunity to make America great again. We ve needed a revolution, and we ve found our revolutionary. Thanks for all your hard work. Congratulations, Donald J. Trump   and here we go, on the road to make America great again. You can watch the video below:Sarah Palin is one of those GOPers that we wish would just go away, but she always seems to find a way to put herself back into the spotlight and remind us of her existence. When Trump decided to run for president, Palin had found her political soulmate and didn t hesitate to back him. The crazy thing is, she thinks the rest of us are stupid enough to follow in her footsteps.To ask Democrats to unite under a party that has built their values on hate and inequality is ludicrous   and you have to possess a special sort of stupidity to even suggest this. Most Americans   even many Republicans   know that Trump is in no condition to lead the country. So no matter who the nominee for the Democratic party is, the majority of the country will be voting blue in November.

8138, Fox News Host BEGS Republicans: Leave Trump ALOOOONE (VIDEO),"Fox News host Eric Bolling wants mean Republicans to just leave his favorite candidate, Donald Trump, alone. Bolling, the host of the Fox weekend business news show Cashin  In, released a special message on the Saturday edition of the program timed to coincide with the upcoming South Carolina primary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8QbU8YMdMBolling, who also co-hosts The Five during the week, noted that the  Our Principles  Republican super PAC headed by former Romney aide Katie Packer is targeting Trump. The ads show that on a number of issues, Trump has flip-flopped from a moderate/liberal position to positions designed to pander to conservative Republican voters. Abortion, health care, and taxes are among Trump s flip-flops.While you would think Bolling, a conservative, would be happy to see an expose of Trump s fakery, his problem is actually with the ad itself.In his rant, Bolling complains about establishment Republicans consistently tearing down conservatives, as he sees it, and points out that he believes the PAC ad is a part of this sustained campaign.He calls on the ad makers to stop going after the reality star turned Republican presidential front-runner and racial demagogue. Bolling, speaking to the camera, told the PAC that  Trump s not your problem. Liberals and socialists are.  He suggests that instead  Why not use that Super PAC money to expose the dark underbelly of liberal politics? Bolling s suggestion is humorous because he effectively works for the biggest anti-liberal Super PAC around, Fox News. His network is a steady stream of lies, half-truths, and propaganda designed to attack the Democratic Party and the left. At the same time, actual super PACs on the right and other dark money groups designed to shield their donors are consistently the source of propaganda campaigns against the left. The Koch Brothers preside over a network that some believe could spend $1 billion in 2016 in order to elect a Republican president and congress.Fox has been the premiere media vehicle for Trump. He has received more airtime on the network than any other candidate, and even when feuding with Fox host Megyn Kelly, he still got coverage on their prime time programming. Of those at Fox, Bolling has been one of the staunchest supporters and defenders of Trump s campaign for months now, and according to a report he was directly ordered to back Trump by Fox News boss Roger Ailes.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",news host bolling candidate host weekend business news show message edition program watch week pac aide packer number trump position abortion health care expose trump problem ad rant bolling establishment pac ad part campaign ad reality star front runner demagogue camera pac problem pac money dark politics suggestion super pac news network stream propaganda party left time right money source propaganda left network believe order president congress fox media vehicle trump network candidate fox host coverage time bolling trump campaign report trump news boss roger image
5165, Trump Just Outed Himself As YUUUGE Liar After Saying He Saw U.S. Plane Unloading Money To Iran,"Oh, Donald Trump. The pathological liar has struck again, although everyone should have seen this coming. At a rally in Daytona Beach, he made an absurd claim that he saw  top secret  footage of a U.S. plane unloading $400 million in payment to Iran the same day that four American detainees were released. Of course, he later used Twitter to try and backpedal, but all he really did was admit that he lied through his teeth:The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2016The tape that he saw allegedly came from Iran, and he made it out to be some kind of taunt on their part: It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in   nice plane   and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us   has to be   by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who s incompetent. They want to embarrass our president.I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It s only for one reason. And it s very, very sad. Oddly enough for him, intelligence officials had zero idea what he was talking about, since no such video exists. There are two yuuuge problems with this:And he has the nerve to call Hillary  Crooked Hillary,  in part because of the right-wing narrative that she mishandled classified info. As president, he ll brag about every juicy thing he sees because it makes him feel important and superior to have access to info that others don t have. He can t wait to tell the world how much better he is than they are.On Wednesday, a spokesperson said that he d simply mistaken a grainy video of detainees being released, which played on Fox News, for this  to secret  video. However, Trump made this absurd claim again on Thursday, in Portland, Maine, as if the video was part of the intelligence briefings he s getting as a presidential candidate.Those briefings have not yet begun.As his story began developing holes, and then unraveling entirely, Trump decided he had to scramble in order to avoid looking like the liar of liars caught in a lie. His tweet is meant to make it look like he d just made a mistake. It s in line with what his spokesperson said, but, again, the timeline is way off.All he really did was say,  I lied about this, but it doesn t matter! Sorry not sorry!

3716," Trump Breaks ANOTHER Huge Campaign Promise, Stabs Followers In The Back Yet Again","During his campaign, Donald Trump routinely called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and at one point he told supporters his Democratic opponent  should be in prison.  Trump s supporters responded by chanting  Lock her up!  at each of his rallies.No matter how many times she was absolved after countless investigation, conservatives were sure Clinton was corrupt and they were certain Trump would hold her accountable. As it happens, Trump will not follow through with that campaign promise.Trump aide Kellyanne Conway tried to spin Trump s sudden flip-flop on MSNBC s  Morning Joe : I think when the President-elect, who s also the head of your party, tells you before he s even inaugurated that he doesn t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content  to other Republicans, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday. If Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that s a good thing to do,  Conway continued, adding that Clinton  still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don t find her to be honest or trustworthy. Well, that s a lie. Votes are still being counted but as of right now, Clinton leads in the popular vote by 1.7 million. I think he s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign are not among them,  she said.Watch:  Special prosecutor, here we come, Right?  Trump said in October as the crowd began another  lock her up  chant. If I win, we re going to appoint a special prosecutor,  Trump said.  Because we cannot allow this to happen in our country. This isn t the first campaign promise Trump has broken and he s not even in office yet. The president-elect is not really going to fully repeal Obamacare.

17050,Judge Orders 12 Yr Old Amish Girl To Take Chemotherapy…Family Goes Into Hiding …2 Yrs Later There’s A Startling Discovery,"Just take this chemotherapy sweetie..the government knows what s best for you.  Oops maybe not this time A judge formally ended the court-ordered guardianship of an Amish girl who resisted a hospital s attempts to force her to resume chemotherapy, bringing a close to the fight that raised questions about the rights of parents in making medical decisions for their children.The judge s decision, announced Friday, came more than a year after Sarah Hershberger s guardian gave up her efforts to force the girl into chemotherapy for leukemia.Sarah and her parents went into hiding in the fall of 2013. Sarah, who is now 12, no longer shows signs of being sick, said Kevin Dunn, a probate judge in Medina County.Cancer free: Sarah Hershberger, second from right, is pictured at her family s roadside stand in Homer Township on September 24. Also pictured are her father and three of her siblingsA visit to her home in August found that Sarah was  active and working daily on the family farm, she appeared healthy and appropriately developed , he wrote. She had MRIs and bloodwork, and the judge over the last year helped facilitate at least one trip to the Cleveland Clinic. The MRIs did not show any cancer,  Maurice Thompson, the family s attorney, told The Medina-Gazette. Once you have it, you re never 100 percent out of the woods, whether or not you get chemotherapy.I know how she looks isn t really an indication of whether she has cancer, but she s looking very healthy. However, Dunn cautioned her parents that she is not fully recovered and warned that they still have a duty to provide her care under Ohio law.Her parents are not free to act entirely as they may choose,  the judge said.Thompson said in a statement that  Sarah s good health bolsters the case against forced health care that we supposedly cannot live without. The court fight began in the summer of 2013, when Sarah s parents decided to halt treatments because they feared chemotherapy was killing her.Doctors at Akron Children s Hospital said Sarah s condition was treatable, but they argued she would die within a year if she stopped chemotherapy.The hospital went to court after the family decided to treat Sarah with natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins.Maria Schimer, an attorney who s also a registered nurse, was given the power to make medical decisions for Sarah after an appeals court ruled the beliefs and convictions of the girl s parents couldn t outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child.But Schimer decided to drop the effort because it became impossible to monitor Sarah s health or make any medical decisions for her after she left home and went into hiding.The family fled their farm in northeast Ohio s Medina County and sought treatment in Mexico before returning home after a few months.Like most Amish, the Hershbergers shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious.They have said they stopped chemotherapy not for religious reasons, but because it was making Sarah too sick.Via: UK Daily Mail ",Government News,"Oct 10, 2015",chemotherapy government time judge court guardianship girl hospital chemotherapy close fight judge decision year guardian girl chemotherapy leukemia fall probate judge county cancer right family roadside stand homer township father visit home august family farm judge year trip cancer family attorney gazette percent indication cancer duty care law judge statement health case health care court summer chemotherapy hospital condition year hospital court family attorney nurse power court girl state child effort health home family farm county treatment home life chemotherapy mail
17806,WATCH: THE VIEW’S WHOOPI GOLDBERG and Her Leftist Co-Hosts Get SCHOOLED By Meghan McCain For Defending Eminem’s Hateful Anti-Trump Rant,"The View s Joy Behar was beaming after watching a clip of Eminem trashing President Trump at the BET awards, where he told his fans that if they support Trump, he doesn t need them to purchase his music. Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand,  That s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say,  I don t care if you don t support me. This is more important than, than my popularity.  I have never seen it, frankly.  Really Joy? What planet have you been living on for the past 2 years?Co-host Sonny Hostin told the adoring liberal crowd,  I was actually at the hair salon watching the BET awards and the salon just um, roared when that happened.   She went on to condemn Trump for using Twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that,  I just thought it was very brave. That s when Meghan McCain, who appeared to be silently seething, as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they re speaking to an audience who s been living on an alternate planet, or don t have any access to real news finally spoke up, saying,  Actually, It s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood. That s when Whoopi lost it Whoopi made a complete fool of herself when she embarrassingly attempted to prove that Meghan McCain doesn t understand history and that communism in Hollywood was really a right-wing movement. Huh? Whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to Amazon to purchase a few books should help Meghan to understand the history of Hollywood, that of course, only Whoopi truly understands. Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck s career peaked in the 1990 s. Outside of his occasional appearances on  Friends  as Monica s boyfriend, Selleck s career has been almost non-existent.Meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in Hollywood and that it s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood than a conservative.  She said that she lived in Los Angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there. Meghan told that cast that it s more popular to be an Obama and Hillary, and even Bernie supporter.Whoopi then embarrassed herself again, when she tried to convince the panel that Meghan s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in Hollywood is ridiculous. Whoopi laughed and corrected McCain saying,  Except that all of the conservatives in Hollywood are working. They re the ones that are working.   She tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in Hollywood.  The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was recently canceled by ABC for his political views.

14752,WOW! Why George W. Bush Never Left DC Until After Christmas Day,"Meanwhile, the Obama s jet off to Hawaii every year well before Christmas. When you read the reason why the Bush s wait in DC until after Christmas day, you ll see why its really all about putting others before yourself Like many Americans, U.S. presidents often take time off around the holidays.However, according to journalist Joseph Curl, who previously covered the White House, former President George W. Bush went on Christmas vacation in a way that stands in direct contrast to President Barack Obama. [H]ere s the thing: In December, we never left Washington, D.C., until the day after Christmas. Never. Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, would always depart the White House a few days before the holiday and hunker down at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland,  Curl wrote in a 2013 column that was republished Thursday.After a few years, curiosity finally got to the former Washington Times reporter and he asked a low-level administration official why. I still remember what she said,  Curl wrote.  So all of us can be with our families on Christmas. Who was  us ? Hundreds and hundreds of people, that s who. Sure, the reporters who covered the president, but also dozens and dozens on his staff, 100 Secret Service agents, maybe more, and all of those city cops required whenever the president s on the move in D.C.,  Curl added in his column.However, things seemingly changed when Obama took office. [T]his president would never delay his trip to his island getaway. He s off every year well before Christmas. Hundreds and hundreds head off with him, leaving family behind,  Curl wrote. No Christmas at home,  he added.  Instead, the Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Nice, but not exactly home.

1428," It’s Happening: Justice Department Appoints Special Counsel For Russia Investigation, Trump FURIOUS","After the nation joined together and demanded a special prosecutor for the Trump/Russia investigation, it happened.Former FBI director Robert Mueller was the second-longest running in history, serving between 2001 and 2013   two years longer than the typical 10-year tenure for his position. My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that prosecution is warranted,  Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein, on whom Trump attempted to blame FBI Director James Comey s firing, said of his decision to appoint special counsel.  I have made no such determination. Rosenstein says that  based on the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command. During his time as FBI director, Mueller taught his agents that  main stream [sic]  Muslims are  radical  and that the more  devout  a Muslim is the more likely he his to be  violent    a view shared by the majority of Republicans.Ultimately, Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who reports to Jeff Sessions, who reports to Donald Trump, but this is the absolute best-case scenario we can hope for in the swampful of corruption that is the Trump administration.It remains to be seen if Mueller, whose conduct as director was called  appalling  and  disgraceful, will be working for the American people or if this is just part of the show.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 17, 2017",nation prosecutor trump russia investigation director history serving year tenure position decision finding prosecution gen rod trump director firing decision counsel determination interest investigation authority person degree independence chain command time director stream sic view majority sessions trump absolute case scenario corruption administration conduct director appalling disgraceful people part show image

It s hard to tell exactly what Hillary stands for. She seemed pretty adamant in the videos below that she was committed to preserving the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman. Hillary Clinton has garnered one of her first major endorsements in run bid for the White House: The nation s largest lesbian political action committee.The group, LPAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday to support the former First Lady s bid to become the nation s first female president.Lesbians4Hillary, co-chaired by pioneering tennis great Billie Jean King, said:  Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion   specifically for women and the LGBTQ community.

11034,UNREAL! NEW YORK TIMES Blames Conservatives For Berkeley Violence…Watch This Video For The Truth! [Video],"Typical! The New York Times tries to blame conservatives for the violence TOTALLY caused by the Antifa thugs. Why does this not surprise us? Leave it to the left to twist and turn the truth to fit their narrative.The New York Times wrote:  conservatives are eagerly putting themselves into volatile situations on campuses Watch this video and then tell us the Conservatives are to blame   NO WAY, NO HOW!MORE PROOF THAT ANTIFA THUGS ARE TO BLAME FOR VIOLENCE: The irony in this entire cancellation of a tradition in Portland, Oregon is that now the Antifa (Anti Fascists) have pissed off the more moderate lefties. One group was going to speak at the parade event against white supremacy but now they won t get the chance. It s turning out that the Antifa group is more violent than any other radical group we ve known. They re even selling knives on their website! A threatening email has derailed one of the Portland Rose Festival s signature events, and spurred new debate about the ongoing political protests in Portland.Organizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade announced Tuesday that the event will be canceled, for fear that the east Portland parade could be disrupted by  the type of riots which happen in downtown Portland.  (see video below)Originally scheduled this Saturday, April 29, the parade is meant to highlight the local community and businesses along Southeast 82nd Avenue, aiming to turn around the negative perception many people have of the area. It started in 2007 and has since become a popular event on the Rose Festival calendar.This year s parade was once again set to feature the Multnomah County Republican Party as one of the many groups slated to march, but that inclusion drew ire from some of the city s left-leaning protest groups.At least two protests were planned for the day of the parade, one by Oregon Students Empowered and another by Direct Action Alliance. Both events were mentioned in an email sent to parade organizers on Saturday, threatening to shut down the event with hundreds of protesters in the street. You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,  the anonymous email said, telling organizers they could cancel the Republican group s registration or else face action from protesters.  This is non-negotiable. The parade is organized by the 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association, a part of the neighborhood business organization Venture Portland. Representatives from neither organization returned calls for comment.The cancelation isn t necessarily a win for the protest groups. Jacob Bureros, an organizer with the Direct Action Alliance, said the organization   which intended to speak out against fascism and white supremacy during the parade   is sad to hear the news. We are disappointed that the parade was canceled,  he said.  We re members of this community and this is an awesome parade. James Buchal, chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, said his group was ready to march despite the protesters. He said the party had no hand in cancelling the event, and was taken by surprise when they heard the news. After seeing the email last weekend, they had no plans to back out. We weren t willing to just walk away quietly,  he said.  The next thing we knew the whole thing was canceled. The problem is the police said they couldn t offer additional security for the parade so the organizers backed out. We know the Portland Police Department can move to stop this type of activity.Check out this recent shut down of protesters blocking a bus in downtown Portland:Portland protesters were doing the usual idiotic tactic of blocking the street and not letting traffic proceed What they didn t realize is that the police aren t taking this anymore Watch the takedown of these punks Awesome!Check out the lady with the thumbs up!

12780,DID HILLARY REALLY THINK She’d Get Away With Telling Big Fat Lie About Obama’s “Red Line” Comment?,"It s not a big surprise given her propensity for lying, but when Hillary knew she was getting destroyed by Trump on her ineffective, embarrassing record as Secretary of State, she lied about not being Obama s Secretary of State during his ridiculous  red line  comment During Sunday night s presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton denied that she was in office as Secretary of State when President Barack Obama refused to punish Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians after calling chemical weapons use a  red line  which could not be crossed. They had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,  Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.  You were there as Secretary of State with the so-called  line in the sand. No, I wasn t, I was gone,  Clinton replied.President Obama delivered his famous  red line  speech   in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a  red line  that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences   in August 2012. We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,  President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013, according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.

17443,"OBAMA’S RACISM CZAR, “REVEREND” AL SHARPTON CALLS FOR FEDERAL POLICE FORCE","Yeah putting the federal government in charge of our entire police force, sounds like a great idea Al. We re waiting for Al to call for an all black police force next you know, in the name of  fairness. Rev. Al Sharpton called for national policing legislation akin to the Civil Rights Act this morning at the kickoff his National Action Network s annual convention, just after the arrest of a white South Carolina police officer for murder in the shooting of an unarmed black man. There must be national policy and national law on policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.  We can t go from state to state, we ve got to have national law to protect people against these continued questions. Mr. Sharpton s comments, coming on the heels of multiple instances of police killings of unarmed men of color around the country, were met with applause from the crowd and from the dais, which was packed with elected officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio, Congressman Charles Rangel, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoliThe convention kickoff, which featured a ribbon cutting with the lawmakers, came just hours after it was announced last night that North Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael T. Slager would be charged with murder in the death of Walter Scott who can be seen in a widely publicized video running away from Mr. Slager, while the officer shoots into the man s back repeatedly. The video offers a markedly different story than the one Mr. Slager first offered up: that Scott had stolen his taser and left him in fear for his life.Mr. Sharpton praised the city s mayor and police chief for bringing the charges, but said the nation couldn t rely on the judgement of local officials. We commend them, but we cannot have a justice system that hopes we have a mayor in the right city or a police chief,  he said.  We have to have one policy that is national. Mr. Sharpton later noted that the comparatively small town s officials had been braver than police leaders in bigger cities. He has been vocal about his belief that New York City police Daniel Pantaleo should have been charged with a crime in the death of an unarmed black Staten Island man, Eric Garner. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Pantaleo, spurring protests throughout the city.That death, too, was captured in a widely published video. And though the footage did not lead to any charges, Mr. Sharpton said today the national legislation should focus on  cameras  as well as  accountability. He compared the fight for police reform to the civil rights struggle, noting that activists did not try to fix discrimination in individual states or cities. They fought for a national Civil Rights Act, a national Voting Rights Act. It s time for this country to have national policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.After the ribbon cutting, Mr. de Blasio whose first year in office was dominated by an effort to reform police-community relations after Garner s death and a subsequent City Hall feud with police union leadership said he agreed some kind of national standard should be set. It s a broad point he s making, and I think he way he made the analogy to the Voting Rights Act is the right one. We ve got to figure out how to create the right relationship between police and community,  Mr. de Blasio told reporters.  The vast majority of police do their job well and want to work more closely with the community. Obviously community residents want to work more closely with the police. But we have to create more of a national standard that says we all have to be on the same page. The relationship between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sharpton was fodder for his woes with police unions last year: they took umbrage when Mr. Sharpton was seated next to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton at a City Hall round table, and dismissed Mr. Sharpton as divisive. A poll later showed voters didn t like the approaches of either Mr. Sharpton or the union leaders and rank-and-file officers who later turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio at the funeral for two slain officers.Today, Mr. Sharpton offered a full-throated defense his relationship with the mayor, saying it was based not on political power but on a long history of working together, citing Mr. de Blasio s support on issues like wage increases and the silent march against stop, question and frisk before his election. He marched with us when other candidates wouldn t. So don t begrudge us for knowing somebody that we always knew, and that was there in the trenches with us,  Mr. Sharpton said, saying he had never asked for favors or back room deals only access and policy changes.  There s nothing in the back room we want. We want everything out front.

17892,LOL! ONE HILARIOUS CARTOON Perfectly Illustrates How Embarrassingly Politically Correct The NFL Has Become,"Watching sports on TV or going to a football stadium to watch a game, used to be a great way to unwind and forget about your troubles at home or at work. Watching sports used to be a stress reliever for many. That was before the NFL and the NBA was hijacked by the politically correct police, and social justice warriors, and morphed into something most fans don t  even recognize anymore.One of the worst cases of political correctness was when liberals insisted that the Washington Redskins change their name so as not to offend Native Americans. The left got very little support from Redskins fans and surprisingly, many in the Native American community were unwilling to join the fight to demand a name change for the team. Eventually, the left was forced to walk away from that fight, and accept that the owners of the Redskins were focused on playing football, and were not interested in their foolish game of political correctness.Today, the NFL is facing a huge backlash from fans, as players are being asked to choose activism over their allegiance to their fans who couldn t care less about their political views, they re coming to escape the stresses of everyday life and to watch these professional athletes play football. They don t come to see professional athletes kneeling on the sidelines during our national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter anti-cop group, who inspired the killings of several innocent cops, shut down major roads, threatened innocent people who got in their way, and looted and burned cities to the ground. Fans come to relax and to forget about their troubles. They come to get away from the divisive politics and challenges of everyday life. They certainly don t travel to stadiums to attend games or watch them on TV so they can be admonished or scolded for not holding the same politically correct views as the snowflakes on the field.This hilarious cartoon by BenGarrison is a perfect example of who fans are paying to see on the field today:It won t be long before fans stop supporting these snowflakes, and politically correct crybabies, and maybe then, they ll remember why we came ",left-news,"Sep 28, 2017",sports football stadium game way home work sports stress reliever police justice something correctness name left support community fight name change team left fight football game correctness today backlash activism allegiance care life football come anthem support matter cop group people way ground politics life field cartoon example field today
8781, Fox News Tries To Discredit POTUS For Saying He Wants To Cure Cancer (VIDEO),"When a president says one of his main goals is to cure a disease that has killed millions and is one of the main causes of death in the United States, one would think that all would applaud such a noble goal. Not so with Fox News, who found a way to try and discredit the president for saying he wants to cure cancer. Here s what the president said last night at his final State of the Union Address: With the new moon shot America can cure cancer. So tonight I m announcing a new national effort to get it done. Let s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. On Fox and Friends, the hosts said that the president or his writers got the idea about curing cancer from the show West Wing because the words he said were apparently similar to a scene from the hit show. Rob Lowe s character, Sam Seaborn  says: We ve reached for the stars, and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp. And so I announce to you tonight, we will cure cancer by the end of this decade. As usual, Fox has the tendency to sensationalize a message instead of applauding the effort of the president.  If you re going to rip off somebody, rip off Aaron Sorkin,  said one of the hosts, referring to West Wing s creator.Whether the words the president said are or aren t similar to a television show is irrelevant because the message itself is so much more important. One can only imagine if the country utilized all its resources to tackle a disease that has wreaked havoc on virtually every American family.Unfortunately, for Fox, finding a way to attack the president takes priority over a wonderful message. It s typical of their so-called right-wing journalism.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 13, 2016",president disease millions death goal news way president cancer president night state union address moon shot cancer effort country cancer fox president idea cancer show wing scene hit show character sam grasp announce cancer end decade fox tendency message effort president somebody creator president television show message country disease havoc family fox way president priority message journalism image

The documents, also available on the State Department website, were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking:All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address.The new documents show that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov email account) to print two March 2011 emails, which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker  aclb ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan s non-state.gov email account. The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption (b)(1) which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as  Foreign government information  and  foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources. Another email shows that Clinton wanted to know how meetings in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning America s war on Libya, would impact her Hampton vacation. Responding to an email that details the sensitive meetings in DC, Clinton emails Abedin on August 26, 2011,  Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?  Again, this email discussion takes place on non-state.gov email accounts.The documents also include advice to Clinton on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton Foundation employee who, according to a Judicial Watch investigative report, also had business interests in Libya. Clinton wanted Blumenthal s March 9, 2011, Libya memo to be printed  without any identifiers. The newly released Abedin emails include a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton s schedule using unsecured government emails. The email from Lona J. Valmoro, former Special Assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Another itinerary email provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure,  that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm. These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people  in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.  When can we expect the indictments?

7227, Trump’s Son Humiliated By Woman He Falsely Accused Of Being A Nazi (TWEET),"Ever since Donald Trump s rallies have become violent dumpster fires with a heavy neo-Nazi and white supremacist presence, his campaign has tried to paint the protesters as secret Bernie Sanders supporters engaging in a conspiracy to make the candidate look bad. They argue that any person, say, seen giving the Nazi salute while wearing a Trump t-shirt is a Bernie  operative  secretly antagonizing people to get a reaction. They have exactly one example of this and it was debunked within a matter of minutes.According to Donald Trump s son, the aptly named Donald Trump Jr., as well as Trump supporters like Ann Coulter and James Woods, a woman whose Nazi salute at a Trump rally went viral is a Bernie Sanders supporter named Portia Boulger. They immediately sent out tweets naming her as the  Nazi  and accusing her of being a paid stooge.Image via WCMH-TVThe problem? The woman in the picture only held a passing resemblance to Boulger; the photographer who took the picture identified the subject as another woman, Birgitt Peterson; and Boulger wasn t even near the Chicago Trump rally the photo was taken at. It wasn t her.Despite this massive screw up, and the sheer awfulness of telling millions of people that an innocent woman is a Nazi, Trump Jr. not only didn t apologize, he never even corrected his original tweet. For days, Trump fans sent the picture around the internet, working themselves into a frenzy over this Bernie Sanders  operative  who was undermining their candidate. A lack of apology isn t surprising for followers of the Trump campaign.The blowhard Republican frontrunner has built his entire platform on the shaky premise that he can never be wrong, he s infallible, and that he s  tough  enough to never take back anything he ever says. Likewise, his cronies like Ann Coulter and James Woods, also make a habit of smearing innocent people and never bothering to find out if the information they pass along is true. However, there is one way to get a Trump to listen to you: Money.Boulger announced that she was demanding a public apology for the smear campaign against her or she would file a lawsuit against Trump Jr.Boulger says even though it s been proven the composite photo wasn t of her, she doesn t feel safe. She believes she was targeted and intimidated because of her support for Bernie Sanders.Now she wants an apology. No one should be able to threaten me or make me feel uncomfortable for exercising the freedoms that I have by living in the United States of America,  she says.Boulger says her attorney is negotiating with Trump s to get that apology. She says she wants it via Twitter.It apparently worked. In the greatest irony in history, the Trump family   known for their lawsuit threats   got played by a woman threatening a lawsuit. Poetic justice.Trump Jr. gave her the tweet that she wanted, announcing to his followers that he had screwed up and that the photo of the Nazi salute was, in fact, one of his dad s fans and not of Boulger.Hilariously, Trump Jr. s fans praised him for his  integrity  for having the guts to apologize. They didn t seem to acknowledge the very real defamation lawsuit he would have faced if he didn t. How s that for integrity?Featured image via  Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2016",trump neo presence campaign sanders conspiracy candidate look person salute trump shirt people reaction example matter son trump woman salute trump rally sanders portia stooge image problem woman picture passing resemblance photographer picture subject woman trump rally photo screw sheer awfulness millions people woman trump tweet days picture frenzy sanders candidate lack apology surprising trump campaign platform premise anything habit people information way trump money apology campaign lawsuit trump photo feel support sanders apology one living attorney trump apology twitter irony history family lawsuit woman lawsuit justice trump tweet photo salute fact dad integrity defamation lawsuit integrity image miller

2327, Trump Advisor’s Excuse For His Boss Ignoring White Terrorism Is Beyond Laughable; It’s Dangerous,"Donald Trump took quite a bit of heat following the racist shooting in Kansas City that resulted in the deaths of two Indian engineers. The perpetrator shouted what sounded like Trump-inspired racial slurs like  get out of my country,  before killing Srinivas Kuchibholta, who died and Alok Madasani, who was injured. Trump took almost a week to address the shooting at all. There was also a spate of vandalism toward Jewish cemeteries and for most of a week, crickets from Trump.Trump did finally talk about the shooting and the vandalism in his address to Congress on Tuesday, but many say it was too little too late. After all, Trump doesn t hesitate in calling out Muslim terrorists. He and his people even make up terrorist attacks.In an interview with CNN s Alisyn Camerota, Trump surrogate Anthony Scaramucci said that the only reason Trump didn t address the Kansas City shooting and the string of vandalism in Jewish cemeteries, was that it would cause more fear and civil unrest. He s not constantly condemning [hate crimes by white people],  Camerota pointed out.  There was silence after Kansas City. He didn t tweet about it. Some people felt if had it been a Muslim, had it been a Middle Eastern gunman instead of a white gunman, he would have immediately condemned it. The president is controlling the bully pulpit and the news cycle, and he doesn t want to overly discuss the stuff because you re worried that in itself will cause a fire,  he replied.  You re trying to strike the right balance. You can agree with me or disagree with me. I do believe the president has consistently, and maybe not with the level of volume you d like, but he has consistently and his administration has consistently denounced these acts of violence. Source: Raw StoryHere s the video:Let s see if you can follow that logic   and I ll be frank, I m having trouble with it. Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric, which has always flowed freely whenever he speaks or tweets, is a huge recruiting tool for ISIS. Apparently, he doesn t care that he is causing unrest and fear toward Muslims and by Muslims.Hate crimes since the election have been up and hate groups are on the rise. The horse has left the barn as far as Trump inspiring hate, but he does have the bully pulpit. If he can influence hate, he can certainly influence people not to act on their hatred. He won t, though. As more and more sane people turn against him, Trump is left with a base that looks a lot like Hitler s Brownshirts. He doesn t want to offend his biggest supporters.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 2, 2017",trump bit heat racist city perpetrator trump country trump week shooting spate vandalism week trump shooting vandalism address trump hesitate people interview trump surrogate reason trump city shooting string vandalism fear unrest hate people silence city tweet people gunman gunman president pulpit news cycle want stuff fire balance president level volume administration violence source raw video let logic trouble anti rhetoric recruiting tool care election rise horse barn hate hate people people trump base lot want image video screen capture
1785, Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News,"A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017",news station boston fox brand reputation channel name newscast news fox drop study audience newscast fox news information country instance morning immigration detention get activity need host activity need life immigrant something sanitation hey outdoor activity garden paradise controversy bill harassment news failure male clown air media group news affiliate brand reputation blue state media decision news director mike news fox news fox brand media fox time image
8976, Tennessee GOP Lawmaker Offers To Fund Bundy Terrorists’ Armed Insurgency (SCREENSHOTS),"Most Republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right-wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in Oregon   but not Tennessee state Rep. Andy Holt.Despite that this group of Yee-Hawdists made tear-filled  goodbye  videos in case they died in a shootout with the Army,  occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (or, as ABC said with plenty of sugarcoating, engaged in an  action  after a peaceful protest), and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause, all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation (protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land)   the very definition of terrorism   we don t even see 1/100 of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality.Holt tweeted   and deleted   what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to Vanilla ISIS.Holt compared the armed militia, which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to  kill or be killed  with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in Ferguson or Baltimore: While Holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which African-Americans are standing up for their rights, he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation-state by force.The Tenth Amendment, of course, does not authorize a mob of right-wing terrorists to occupy anything, by force or not   nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government. However, as one Democrat, Chattanooga City Councilman Chris Anderson,  pointed out, Holt s offer to help the Bundy terrorists may constitute Treason.While Holt may think he understands the 10th Amendment, he doesn t quite grasp Article III of the Constitution, which states:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.In fact, U.S.C.S 2383 covers insurrection quite nicely, as well:Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Anderson has asked the Justice Department to investigate. Holt, of course, dismissed Anderson s concerns with the tried-and-true  Yeah, well you re gay  response:He says that he deleted his treasonous offer  so liberal loons will quit responding  but whines that  More liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate.  Get off Twitter & read the Constitution, kids,  he said, ironically.Perhaps Anderson is right that Holt   who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government   should be investigated for treason.Featured image via screengrab/YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016",regard building state rep group yee tear case army wildlife refuge plenty action protest cause pursuit purpose intimidation help prison occupation land definition terrorism police presence area protest police brutality holt offer assistance holt militia occupation times holt stance arson vicinity area mob nation state force amendment course mob anything force permission government democrat city councilman offer treason holt amendment article constitution treason war aid comfort person treason testimony act confession court congress power punishment treason attainder treason corruption blood forfeiture life person fact insurrection foot rebellion insurrection authority aid comfort thereto title office justice department holt course response offer offer aid twitter constitution holt assistance terrorist cell war government treason image
5790, Five States Have Now Voted To Circumvent Congress To Eliminate Citizens United (VIDEO),"If there s one thing most progressives   both Bernie and Hillary supporters   agree on, it s that Citizens United needs to go. In fact, most Americans   nearly 80 percent   agree that Citizens United needs to go. You d think that would be all Congress needs to propel them to do the right thing, but unfortunately, thanks to the very Supreme Court decision everyone hates, Congress won t do anything about it. There s too much money involved. The states, though   that s another matter. Five have already voted to reverse the decision and you can bet that more are coming soon.This year, over a billion dollars will be spent electing just the president. Millions will be spent on down ticket candidates. Much of this money is coming from PACs and Super PACs, with donations from corporations and billionaires. The money goes right into the coffers of candidates, who in turn give the money to media outlets who inundate us with ads. Everyone wins except the American people. Neither the media nor the politicians complain, mostly because they don t want to bite the hands that feed them. So, it s up to grass roots movements, and the grass roots will win out.The cliche is that the way to fight fire is with fire. That s what an organization called WolfPac is doing. They have opened a pac that is designed to get rid of Pacs and Super PACs. Here s what they want to do:To restore true, representative democracy in the United States by pressuring our State Legislators to pass a much needed Free and Fair Elections Amendment to our Constitution. There are only 2 ways to amend our Constitution: (1) Go through Congress (single digit approval rating) or (2) Go through our State Legislators via an amendment proposing convention.Wolf PAC believes that we can no longer count on our Federal Government to do what is in the best interest of the American people due to the unfettered amount of money they receive from outside organizations to fund their campaigns. We point to the failure of the Disclose Act as rock solid evidence that this would be a total waste of our time, effort, and money. We also point to the recent decision by the US Supreme Court to not even hear a case filed by Montana claiming it did not have to abide by Citizens United, as proof that state legislation is not a sufficient measure to solve this problem. We believe that we have no choice but to put an amendment in the hands of our State Legislators, who are not, at this moment in time, completely blinded by the influence of money, and might actually do what 96% of the country wants   take away the massive influence that money has over our political process.The list of states that have jumped on board is hardly surprising. It started with Vermont, the one state brave enough to elect a Democratic Socialist as a senator. In 2012, Vermont passed a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment saying that only people are people and that corporations are just made up entities. Then came California, the largest state in the country. Then came New Jersey and Illinois.The latest to join the call for a constitutional amendment if Rhode Island. In a unanimous vote, the state of Rhode Island became the fifth to take matters into their own hands.Here s the video:And more from The Young Turks:Sure, this is a drop in the bucket. A constitutional amendment needs to be ratified by 38 states and there aren t 38 blue states in the country, but that might not matter. People are sick of our elections being purchased by the highest bidder. People are sick of billionaires having a much larger voice in our democracy than anyone else. People are sick of the constant barrage of political advertising. The only people to lose out of turning corporations back into non-people are corporations and the politicians whose pockets are being lined.Featured image via Alex Wong with Getty Images.

2688, WATCH: White Grievance Queen Tomi Lahren Gets OWNED For Being Racist,"Tomi Lahren appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night and got totally owned for spewing her racist bullshit.Bill Maher wondered if Trump would have been elected president had he been black instead of white. What do you think if Trump was black,  Maher asked his panel. Maher described a scenario where Trump is black and has had three wives and brags about grabbing women  by the p*ssy.  Would he still have been elected?Michael Eric Dyson s response was that black Trump would not even be running for president because he would be in prison.Indeed, black people end up in prison for doing a lot of the same shit white people usually get away with. That s why black people make up a larger portion of the prison population.No black person would have been elected president by acting like Trump.Lahren responded that it wouldn t have bothered her at all if Trump were a black man, which we all know is a complete lie. I don t think it would matter,  she said, drawing shock and outrage from the audience because even they knew Lahren was lying.Maher asked Lahren about the fact that over 60 percent of Republicans believe that discrimination against white people is as bad as discrimination against black people.Lahren tried to side-step the question but Maher repeated it again. Lahren then teeter-tottered in her answer, saying that there s an  element  of this that is true but appeared to admit that Republicans are wrong to make that claim.That s when Republican strategies Rick Wilson spoke up and absolutely nailed Lahren. Since I m a conservative and not a Trump person, let me say this,  Wilson said.  That s absurd. That s f*cking crazy. Here s the video via VidMe.Later on, Lahren blamed President Obama for the loss of coal mining jobs in this country. As we all know, President Obama sought to reduce and prevent the effects of climate change by issuing rules stopping the coal industry from polluting, but Lahren had the gall to defend Republicans for recently repealing those rules. So once again, the coal industry will be able to dump waste in waterways.Maher argued that these coal miners could be trained to do other kinds of jobs, such as renewable energy jobs that are safer for workers and better for the environment. Lahren treated the coal miners like they are incapable of learning to do something new, as if they were all marked to be coal miners at birth.Once again, Rick Wilson shut her down. There s a kind of hazy nostalgia with Trump s plan,  We re going to have ironworks and shipyards and coal miners,  Wilson said.  These are things   we might as well get our buggy-whip industry back together again. It s this retrospective, fake past that doesn t exist anymore. And, God bless them, they work their asses off, and you know what, natural gas took their jobs, not Barack Obama.

3063, Trump Just Lost His SH*T After Report Claims He Paid Russian Ladies To Pee On His Bed In Moscow (TWEETS),"Get ready to explain to your children what a  golden shower  is, because it s going to be a hot topic in the news for anywhere between a month and four years thanks to Donald Trump. A new report reveals information from a man who CNN says is a former British spy who is trusted by American intelligence but now does opposition research. On Tuesday, the network reported that a two-page summary had been provided to President Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and Trump is pissed off now that the content has been released in full by Buzzfeed.While it is important to note that the report is not completely verified, the document reveals some information that Trump probably wanted to keep private   like that time he was staying at a hotel in Russia and paid some nice ladies to pee on his bed (not to mention evidence that Trump s campaign worked directly with the Russian government). According to Source D, where s/he had been present, Trump s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the Presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs Obama (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a [redacted] show in front of him,  the report reads.Naturally, Trump couldn t handle this  big reveal  and completely flew off the handle on Twitter:This was just too much for the people of Twitter to handle, and they responded perfectly to the puddle Trump had stepped in:@realDonaldTrump you sound pissed.

18803,ANTI-TRUMP Communications Specialist For UN Arrested In NYC For Robbing Banks During Lunch,"A United Nations employee was busted for robbing four Manhattan banks   all during his lunch hour, authorities said.Only 3 weeks ago, the anti-Trump UN worker warned on Facebook that some  dubious characters are betraying us  and that he would reveal names later. (see post below).Abdullahi Shuaibu, 53, was picked up by cops Monday and hit with two counts of robbery and two counts of attempted robbery for the crimes committed during his two-month spree.Abdullah Shuaibu s LinkedIn account states that he lives in New York and is currently employed by the UN as a  Communications Specialist .A photo from Shuaibu s Facebook page shows him standing with UN General Assembly President Morgens Lykketoft. Abdullah Shuaibu s Facebook page includes several anti-Trump posts like this one where he hilariously refers to  The New Yorker  as  one of America s most prestigious magazines LOL!So a guy who works for the UN and holds up banks on his lunch hours is concerned about a private conversation Trump had with another guy on a bus? Shuaibu claims  racism  is the  Trump card  in this post: All four banks are within walking distance of UN headquarters on First Ave. near E. 42nd St., where the Nigeria native works as a journalist for an African news agency, police said.Authorities were led to the thief after a retired police officer who works at the facility recognized Shuaibu from a surveillance image previously released by the NYPD.In the first incident, Shuaibu walked into a Santander Bank on Madison Ave. near E. 43rd St. on Feb. 27 and told the teller he had a gun. The bank employee complied and handed Shuaibu an unknown sum of money.He hit two more banks during the month of March, first striking out at a Bank of America on Third Ave. near E. 47th St. on the 13th. He was successful in robbing a Santander Bank on Third Ave. and E. 63rd St. on the 27th.Police arrested him later in the day when he returned to the UN.

5854, Trump Has Now Banned NINE Media Outlets – A Likely Tenth Predicts Misery For Him Over It,"When Donald Trump banned the Washington Post from his events, he no doubt thought it was the boldest move yet in his war against the  dishonest  media. The Post, however, is far from the first outlet to fall to Trump s wrath. To date, Trump has actually banned nine media outlets from covering his events. Nine. But he won t stop until he s sure the coverage he s getting fits his definition of  honest  and  fair. The New York Times, whom Trump reviles but somehow hasn t totally banned yet, went to work compiling a list of blacklisted outlets after explaining why Trump banned the Post. They added: In reality, of course, no one would be more miserable than Mr. Trump if these bans actually resulted in less coverage of his campaign. That s a truth bomb if ever there was one. Trump s need for glowing praise, kowtowing and general ass-kissing means he absolutely must hog as much of the spotlight as possible. That includes all the favorable media coverage he can get. But if he thinks that coverage will become more favorable after he bans outlets in fits of rage appropriate to a toddler, he ll be sorely disappointed.The truly funny thing about this is that he hasn t thought it through at all. Reporters from blackballed outlets can still attend most of Trump s events as members of the general public. They can t get credentials, and they can t attend his official press conferences, but they can still go to and cover rallies and other events. That means that Trump is spiraling down into some serious delusions if he thinks these bans will solve his imagined problems with the media.So who, besides the Post, has he banned, and why?Besides banning entire outlets, he s barred reporters from Mother Jones, Fusion, and The New York Times, and claimed credit for getting The New Hampshire Union Leader dropped from a debate after they published a front-page op-ed denouncing him.In demonstration of his racism, The New Tri-State Defender, a traditionally black publication, can t even get responses to emails requesting credentials. Yet he ll issue credentials to Alex Jones  InfoWars, which is quite possibly one of the most craftily dumb conspiracy sites on the internet.Trump claims he won t ban any media from the White House press room when he s elected, telling CNN,  It s a different thing.  He added: When I m representing the United States, I wouldn t do that. But I would let people know if somebody s untruthful. Oh, baloney. The people of the U.S. will believe that when they see it. However, that could go two ways. One is obvious   he ll keep banning the outlets he hates until there are none left to cover him. The other is that he ll come to his senses, such as they are, and realize that a growing blacklist means less food for his narcissistic ego. Either way, he s out of hand with his.

22797,Watch as Assad Destroys US Reporter Michael Isikoff in Interview,"21st Century Wire says After 7 years of systematic and pathological lying, and fabricating thousands of fraudulent news reports about Syria, by now it s widely understood that US and UK media have now lost all credibility by now. Even since the defeat of the western-backed terrorist occupation of East Aleppo in December 2016, western corporate media outlets dispatched various trained gatekeepers and deep state stenographers in an attempt to try and rescue many of their legacy narratives, all of which have since collapsed after most western and Gulf-backed terrorists have fled their strongholds   while leaving volumes of damning evidence behind in the process. With that in mind, we thought it poignant then to re-air this timeless exhibit   a breathtaking display of US propaganda gone array, where Yahoo! News reporter Michael Isikoff become mired in his own web of disinformation and official conspiracy theories, as he tries to deliver a series of canned talking points (straight off of the CNN and CIA briefing sheet) in yet another vain attempt to defame and demonize Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the Presidential Palace in Damascus. In this embarrassing exchange, Isikoff tries on a series of contrived  reports  concocted by Amnesty International and the FBI, and even alludes to the widely discredited  Caesar Photos  hoax, amid a sustained barrage of  human rights  virtue signalling, all while accusing Assad of numerous  war crimes. As interviews go, this was certainly one of the low water marks in US media history. Watch: See the full Yahoo! News report which aired on February 10, 2017 here.

20363,IRON FISTED SOCIAL ENGINEERING: D.C. Threatens Fines For Anyone Who Improperly Addresses Transgenders,"Following a leftist agenda is no longer optional. Follow their rules or be subject to fines The guide states,  The District uses the probable cause standard in determining whether the above constitute harassment or a hostile work environment. Stephanie Franklin, OHR s interim director of policy and communications, confirmed in an email that  Any workplace environment in DC private businesses included  in which supervisors or co-workers deliberately misuse a person s preferred name or pronoun may be considered unlawful harassment and/or a hostile work environment according to DC law. The  best practices  guide featues a chart on  gender and gender-neutral pronouns  that includes the gender-neutral pronoun  ze.  The chart includes example phrases using the gender-neutral pronoun, such as  Ze smiled,   I met zir,   Zir bike  and  Ze is zirself. Regardless of the legal name and gender, employers should use an employee s desired name and pronouns when communicating with them, and when talking about them to third parties,  the guide states.The guide says,  The employer must ensure employees respect and use a transgender employee s preferred names and pronouns, as repeated failure to do so can be considered harassment, and can cause severe distress to a transgender employee. The guide also make clear that employees should be allowed to use the bathroom in which they re most comfortable . Transgender employees should at all times be able to use the restroom and other gender-segregated facilities (such as locker rooms) that they are most comfortable with,  the guide states.In the 2015 fiscal year, 307 discrimination complaints (including race, gender and disability complaints) ended in settlements via the mediation process. In 2015, the annual report states,  more than $3.69 million was awarded in settlements during successful mediations, a 74 percent increase over [the 2014 fiscal year].  That averages out to more than $12,000 per settlement. According to non-profit organization Workplace Fairness, D.C. s anti-discrimination protections are  broader than federal law because you may prove your case by showing that your employer acted wholly or partially for discriminatory reasons, and because you can bring an individual claim against your supervisor for  aiding and abetting  discrimination.

5873, WATCH: Fox Host Unexpectedly Declares Support Of Assault Weapon Ban On The Air,"When even Fox News begins to call for gun control, it s a clear sign that Republicans and the NRA better start compromising.Gretchen Carlson has been one of the most vocal hosts on the conservative network for years, and she has consistently toed the Republican Party line throughout her years as co-host of Fox & Friends and now throughout her tenure hosting her own solo program.But in the wake of a domestic terrorist attack that killed 50 people in an Orlando night club this past weekend, Carlson could no longer sit back and be a puppet for the gun nuts, which is why she went totally off script during her show and declared her support for banning assault weapons such as the AR-15 used in the massacre. There s no doubt Omar Mateen was able to kill so many people because he was firing an AR-15,  Carlson said.  A military-style assault weapon, a weapon easier to buy in the state of Florida than buying a handgun. Florida sets a three day waiting period for purchasing handguns, but the state mandates no waiting period for any gun that requires two hands to hold. Carlson s remarks on Florida gun laws appear to be a rebuke of Florida Governor Rick Scott, who not only just offered thoughts and prayers instead of acting to prevent future mass shootings in response to Orlando, he s the one who weakened Florida s gun laws over the last five years.Carlson further justified her stance by pointing out that 58 percent of Americans support a ban on assault weapons. Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?  she continued.  I m in favor of people being able to carry. I think some of these mass shootings would have been less deadly if that were the case. But despite her support of Second Amendment rights, Carlson said banning assault weapons is just  common sense  and stated that it is time for Americans to take a stand in order to prevent mass shootings in the future. But I m also with the majority today, taking a stand. Can t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense? 89 percent of Fox viewers, however, refused to shake off the brainwashing the NRA has drilled into them over the years by overwhelmingly rejecting passage of a new assault weapons ban.Here s the video via YouTube.America once did have a ban on assault weapons in place, but Republicans let it expire and refused to renew it. And mass shootings have increased ever since.According to the New Century Foundation in 2012,In the eight years since the Assault Weapons Ban has expired, there have been 28 mass shooting events. That equals an average of 3.5 a year an increase of over 200 percent. That is a startling jump, by any measure.During the ten year duration of the ban between 1994 and 2004, there were 15 mass shootings. In 2015 alone there were at least six major mass shootings that occurred, more depending on what statistics and definition you use. So this is a continuing problem that isn t going away by praying. It s going to take action such as the action taken by Australia in 1996. After five mass shootings between 1987 and 1996, the country finally had enough of the carnage and banned assault weapons. There hasn t been a mass shooting ever since.But it s different in the United States. We have a Second Amendment, therefore it is harder to ban guns entirely. However, banning assault weapons isn t the only change we could demand. We also need better background checks and we need law enforcement to have the ability to ban people from having guns if they are on the terrorist watch list. Had Republicans not refused to do that latter action, perhaps those 50 people would be alive today because Mateen, who was an ISIS sympathizer, would not have been able to legally buy the AR-15 he used to slaughter them.Gretchen Carlson deserves props for supporting a ban on assault weapons, even though she definitely risks being fired for doing so.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"June 14, 2016",news gun control sign start network party line host tenure program wake attack people night club weekend puppet gun script show support assault ar massacre doubt people ar style assault weapon state handgun day period state period gun gun rebuke governor rick mass response one gun stance percent ban assault deer favor people mass case support amendment assault sense time stand order mass future majority today stand sanctity amendment sense percent fox passage assault video ban assault place century foundation assault ban mass average year increase percent jump measure year duration ban mass mass statistics definition problem action action mass country enough carnage assault mass amendment assault change background law enforcement ability people watch list action people today sympathizer ar ban assault image
341, Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password.

2994, GOP Congressman Hosts Repeal Obamacare Town Hall; It Didn’t Go The Way He Wanted (VIDEO),"Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colorado) is one of the Republicans who is dead set on repealing the Affordable Care Act. Before Saturday, he thought his constituents were with him, that is, until he held a town hall meeting. It went so badly for him that he snuck out before the end.About 150 people showed up at the Aurora Public Library on Saturday. Less than half of those, though, got to speak with the Congressman, and then each of them only got five minutes.Despite booking a large room with ample space, Coffman allowed in only four constituents at once for five minutes at a time. When the crowd grew restless, police put up crime scene tape and Coffman snuck out the back door six minutes before the event was scheduled to end.Source: SlateColorado was one of the states to embrace the Affordable Care Act. Under the law, the state s number of uninsured was cut by more than half.Despite that, Coffman has been on the front line of the repeal movement. The day before the town hall, Coffman wrote an op-ed in the Denver Post advocating its repeal.Yet Coffman has not proposed a clear replacement for the law, an issue constituents hoped to ask him about on Saturday.  I am potentially going to lose my health insurance,  Berthie Ruoff told NBC 9 while she waited to meet with her representative.  I ve had a preexisting condition. I ve had breast cancer. What s going to happen to me? My spouse who had health insurance passed away. What do I do? You know, what am I supposed to do? The crowd at the town hall wasn t sympathetic. Coffman didn t talk to anyone who was at risk for losing their insurance. The crowd reacted by singing, yes singing, and then Coffman snuck out.A few people noticed Coffman sneaking out and attempted to address him.  Next time,  one woman pleaded,  please be sure you hear all your constituents!  Coffman ignored them, hopped into a waiting car, and drove away.  Have a good afternoon!  yelled another exasperated woman.Coffman blamed the time. He said they only had 90 minutes and that the event was only supposed to be one on one.Here s the video of the crowd singing:Crowd starts singing while trying to get in to see Congressman Mike Coffman in Aurora.

2024, SPINELESS: Paul Ryan Actually RAN AWAY From Reporters After Trumpcare FAIL (VIDEO),"Everyone knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has absolutely no backbone, but what he did yesterday was an entirely new low for the Republican Party.Yesterday was a disaster for the GOP to begin with. Donald Trump pathetically failed to gain enough votes for the disastrous American Health Care Act, and the GOP suffered a major humiliation as the glorious plan they ve been promising to implement and do away with Obamacare with for the past seven years deteriorates before their eyes. After such a horrible, embarrassing day, it was clear that Ryan didn t have it in him to face the press and answer the many critical questions that Americans have about Trumpcare.Ryan emerged from the failed discussions over Trumpcare, visibly frustrated and not in the mood to make nice with reporters. He gave a short statement in which he was clearly angry and uncomfortable: For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it s collapsing and it s failing families, and tomorrow we re proceeding. He ended his address abruptly, literally running off and away from reporters demanding answers. You can watch this disgusting behavior below, courtesy of the Rachel Maddow Show: This is clearly a sign that the GOP knows how badly they ve just failed, and they re aware of how pathetic the party looks right now. This could not be a more painful time for the GOP   their disastrous reality television star of a candidate won the election and even though he s only been in the White House a little more than two months, he s f*cked things up more than anyone thought he would. With Trump s help, the Republican Party has done irreversible damage to its reputation   and they only have themselves to thank.

3539, Obama Just Threw MAJOR Shade At Trump During Last National Security Speech (VIDEO),"During President Obama s final National Security speech as president, he took a moment to let President-Elect Trump know that it s imperative citizens are able to criticize authority without fearing they ll get in trouble.It was clearly a remark aimed at Trump because of the president-elect s inability to be able to take criticism and will often lash out in some way shape or form against whoever dare to speak up against him or have a different opinion.President Obama said: freedom can never be taken for granted. Each of us has a responsibility to sustain it. The universal right to speak your mind   protest against authority. To live in a society that s open and free. That can criticize a president without retribution. If Trump actually wants to be president, he s going to have to learn how to handle criticism, and he s going to have to learn fast. He s not only going to get criticized by both sides of the aisle, but by the public at large and the rest of the world. He needs to be able to handle that and not do anything to threaten our national security nor the freedom of American citizens to speak their mind.President Obama has been one of our most criticized national leaders in a long time, and he, more than most, knows that you must keep a level head, and he clearly wants Trump to learn how to do that too.Watch President Obama throw major shade at Trump here:Obama says the US is a country where citizens have a right to  protest against authority  and criticize a  president without retribution  pic.twitter.com/8XQAw0BdAt  Brianna Sacks (@bri_sacks) December 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"December 6, 2016",president security speech president moment president trump authority trouble remark trump president inability criticism way shape form dare opinion president freedom responsibility right mind protest authority society president retribution president criticism sides aisle public rest world anything security freedom mind president time head trump president throw shade trump country right authority president retribution pic twitter image video screen capture
867, Dem Senator On Trump World: ‘They Lie As Easily As They Breathe’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s White House is in more turmoil than ever, as it turns out that Donald Trump Jr. just provided the entire world with email evidence that he was more than willing to collude with a Russian national to try and fix an election by collecting dirt on 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Ever since the fact that Trump Jr. met with a shady Russian lawyer came out, everyone in Trump World has been spinning madly in order to try and make all of this potentially criminal activity seem like it means nothing. More than anything, they have lied through their teeth to do so. Well, there is one person who is willing to call them out for being lying liars: Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.Senator Whitehouse appeared on MSNBC s All In with Chris Hayes on Wednesday evening, and ripped the folks in Trump World a new one on this issue. He also said that the Trump Jr. emails take on a new legal meaning   and that it means people need to stop talking to the press and start talking under oath. Of course, for pathological liars, this is a huge deal, because lying under oath is a crime.Senator Whitehouse said to host Chris Hayes: If there s been a legal violation here   and this very strong indications that there has   then you re dealing with things like indictments, and the House potentially beginning impeachment proceedings, and people having to start talking under oath, instead of you know, talking out on the airwaves, where they lie as easily as they breathe. BOOM! That is exactly what we need to hear. These people are covering something up, and that becomes more evident by the hour. Donald Trump himself might be protected from criminal indictments   the idea of indicting a sitting president is definitely an open question   but whether or not the people around him can be indicted certainly is not.Thank you, Senator Whitehouse for speaking truth to power. Keep it up, and we might just get rid of this criminal excuse for an administration yet.Watch the video below:Whitehouse: ppl may have to start talking under oath instead of in media where they ""lie as easily as they breathe"" https://t.co/KEAk4jYJM3  All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) July 13, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 13, 2017",trump house turmoil trump world evidence election dirt nominee fact trump lawyer everyone trump world order activity nothing anything teeth person senator island senator evening world issue trump meaning people press oath course deal oath crime senator violation house people oath boom people something hour trump idea president question people truth power excuse administration video oath media image chip

4880," Federal Judge Tells Anti-Vaxxers To Go F*ck Themselves, Upholds Strict California Vaccination Law","Anti-vaccination advocates were hoping they could continue exposing the general public to diseases that had been largely wiped out by vaccines, but a judge dashed that hope on Friday.In 2015, California dealt with a months long measles epidemic stemming from a person who was visiting Disneyland.According to the Los Angeles Times:131 California residents were believed to have been infected with measles during the outbreak that began at Disneyland, as well as at least 26 people who resided in seven other states, Canada or Mexico, after visiting the Anaheim theme park or catching the virus from someone who went there.The outbreak created a health crisis in the state, especially since some schools have immunization rates around 50 percent or lower according to state epidemiologist, Dr. Gil Chavez.Measles had been eradicated in America by 2000, but because some crackpot researcher in England published a terribly flawed study claiming that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been thoroughly debunked by scientists, many paranoid and ignorant parents have decided not to vaccinate their kids, which is why 7 in 10 Californians who got the measles were unvaccinated. If we had higher levels of immunity in the community, this outbreak would not have happened,  Chavez said.And the risk of exposure was not just in California schools. Public health officials contacted thousands of Californians in 12 counties potentially exposed to measles, leading to warnings in airports, malls, schools, clinics and hospitals,  the Times reported.  In one hospital alone, a single person with measles exposed 14 pregnant women and 98 infants, including 44 in the neonatal intensive care unit. After California quelled the epidemic, state lawmakers went to work to make sure such an epidemic never happens again. To that effort, they took particular aim at personal and religious exemptions that anti-vaxxers have taken advantage of over the years to decline to vaccinate their kids. They soon passed a law requiring all children to be vaccinated. The only exemption allowed is if the child has a medical condition, such as a suppressed immune system, that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.But anti-vaxxers threw a hissy fit and filed a lawsuit last month in order to prevent lawmakers from protecting the public health and safety.And U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that they can go f*ck themselves and laughed them out of court because state lawmakers have a  long history of requiring children to be vaccinated as a condition to school enrollment  and  plaintiffs have not made a showing that they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. In short, the law will go into effect this year and now every child will be required to be vaccinated if they want to be enrolled.And that s a good thing.We cannot let irresponsible parents put the public health at risk just because they disagree with science. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man and is even more contagious and deadlier than Ebola.Sixteen years ago this country had wiped out the disease within our shores, and all that effort went to waste because some parents listen more to celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy than they do to doctors and scientists. That needs to change, and this California law is the first step.Featured image via CBS News",News,"August 27, 2016",vaccination public judge hope dealt measles person times measles outbreak people theme park virus someone outbreak health crisis state immunization percent state epidemiologist measles crackpot researcher study autism claim paranoid measles immunity community outbreak risk exposure health measles times hospital person measles care unit state effort aim advantage law exemption child condition immune system vaccine fit lawsuit month order health safety district judge court state history condition school enrollment showing remedy injunction law effect year child thing health risk science measles man country disease effort jenny law step image news

While the federal government continues to target immigrants and threatens to tear families apart with deportation, these actions take a critical step toward a more just, more fair and more compassionate New York,  Cuomo said in a statement.WE SAY THAT TRUMP SHOULD CUT OFF INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS!IGNORING CRIMINAL HISTORIES:Among those pardoned Wednesday was Lorena Borjas, 57, who had been convicted of criminal facilitation in 1994 as a result of being a victim of human trafficking. Borjas, a transgender woman from Mexico, has worked as an advocate for the transgender and immigrant communities since her conviction, the governor s office said. Freddy Perez, 53, was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in 1993. Perez, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, said he hopes to become a U.S. citizen, according to the governor s office.Prior to Wednesday s pardons, Cuomo had issued seven pardons for immigrants in an effort to postpone their deportation, The New York Times reported.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Dec 28, 2017",democrat immigration enforcement criminal pardon rehabilitation president trump line immigration rule law line year executive order immigration law yesterday york governor executive order law enforcement citizenship status state law enforcement ice bar immigration government deportation step york statement trump infrastructure funds facilitation result victim woman advocate conviction governor office sale substance immigrant republic citizen governor office effort deportation york times hill
14467,"QUESTION: Since Paris Terror Attacks, How Muslim Refugees Have Arrived In U.S.? How Many Are Christians? [VIDEO]","The answer to this question should shock every American The government has admitted 605 Syrian refugees for resettlement in the United States since last November s Paris terrorist attack, two of whom are Christians.The rest are 589 Sunni Muslims, 10 Shia Muslims, three other Muslims, and one refugee identified in State Department Refugee Processing Center data as  other religion. At the same time, the proportion of Christians among the total cohort of Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. since the conflict began five years ago has now dropped below two percent.Just 55 Christians (1.9 percent) are among the 2,769 Syrian refugees admitted since March 2011, while a large majority   2,594 (93.6 percent)   has been Sunni Muslims.Christians accounted for about 10 percent of Syria s population when the civil war began and Sunni Muslims for an estimated 74 percent.The administration has rejected calls by some Republican lawmakers, and some GOP presidential candidates, for Syrian Christians to be prioritized in the refugee admission process.Here s the truth about how these Muslim  refugees  who are coming from countries who hate are finding their way  to the United States:The ISIS terrorist attack in Paris on November 13 fueled concerns that the terrorist group was exploiting the flow of refugees and migrants as cover to send jihadists into the West to carry out attacks.French authorities said two of the attackers had been carrying fake Syrian passports and warned European Union partners that  some terrorists are trying to get into our countries and commit criminal acts by mixing in with the flow of migrants and refugees. Last Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper affirmed during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that ISIS has done so. Isn t it already proven that Mr. Baghdadi is sending people with this flow of refugees that are terrorists that   in order to inflict further attacks on Europe and the United States?  Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) asked him, referring to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That s correct,  Clapper replied.  That s one technique they ve used is taking advantage of the torrent of migrants to insert operatives into that flow. In addition, he continued, ISIS has become  pretty skilled at [producing] phony passports, so they can travel ostensibly as legitimate travelers as well. In December, House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said the U.S. intelligence community  has identified already individuals tied to terrorist organizations in Syria that want to exploit and get into the United States through the refugee process.

10147,EXPOSE THE LEFT! DOJ Digs Into Anti-Trump Website to Expose Violent Rent-a-Mob Organizers,"SHINE A LIGHT ON THESE VIOLENT GROUPS!Thank you to AG Jeff Sessions for digging into who s behind the Antifa and other anti-Trump groups!The Trump Department of Justice has requested information on users from anti-Trump website DisruptJ20.The Department of Justice has requested information on visitors to a website used to organize protests against President Trump, the Los Angeles-based Dreamhost said in a blog post published on Monday.Dreamhost, a web hosting provider, said that it has been working with the Department of Justice for several months on the request, which believes goes too far under the Constitution.DreamHost claimed that the complying with the request from the Justice Department would amount to handing over roughly 1.3 million visitor IP addresses to the government, in addition to contact information, email content and photos of thousands of visitors to the website, which was involved in organizing protests against Trump on Inauguration Day:FROM THE DISRUPT20 WEBSITE:After successfully disrupting Trump s Inauguration we are excited to announce, that we will continue #OurResistance. #DisruptJ20 is rebranding into two activist hubs: WeDisrupt & ResistThis!.Resistthis.org Will work to ensure that #OurResistance to the Trump administration continues to grow and remain inclusive to all our peoples.Wow! This anarchist organization s only job is to  disrupt  America! Jeff Sessions needs to keep digging to get to who is organizing violent protests! That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution s First Amendment,  DreamHost wrote in the blog post on Monday.

2616, Trump’s Own SCOTUS Nominee Just Threw Him Under The Bus Over His Stupid Tweets,"Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump s nominee for the Supreme Court seat that s sat empty since Antonin Scalia died a year ago, has joined the ranks of the outraged when it comes to Trump and his damned Twitter account. Gorsuch is specifically upset with Trump s statements about the judiciary branch of the government, and told Sen. Richard Blumenthal that in a meeting earlier today: He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way,  Blumenthal said of Gorsuch.  I said they were more than disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the American people, so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump s attacks on the judiciary are. For someone who sits on the bench, it s easy to see how that would be disheartening and demoralizing. An attack doesn t have to be directed squarely at you to still feel like an attack. Trump attacked our entire judicial system and insulted all the judges within it when he went off on Judge Robart for blocking his Muslim ban. Gorsuch told Sen. Chuck Schumer as much, too.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has been hearing arguments on the legality of the Muslim ban, and apparently the three judges hearing that case gave the lawyers arguing a really tough time. They grilled the lawyer representing the Department of Justice on whether the government even had evidence that the seven countries named in the ban are connected to terrorism.It s a pointed question because Saudi Arabia, which does have strong ties to terrorism and has exported terrorism to the U.S., is not included in the ban. When August Flentje refused to answer it and instead tried again to argue that Trump has broad authority in this area, Judge Michelle Friedland asked: Are you arguing then that the President s decision in that regard is unreviewable (by a court)? Flentje s answer was yes. In other words, Flentje argues that Trump can do what s necessary in his judgement to keep the U.S. safe, and a court can t say otherwise. That s part of what Robart weighed when he blocked the Muslim ban. The 9th Circuit will end up on Trump s radar here pretty quickly if they uphold Robart s decision.Then Gorsuch will have to determine whether he wants to serve on a court that s going to be the subject of juvenile attacks when they rule in a way that Trump doesn t like. His confirmation hearing is coming up. He probably won t withdraw, but he has a lot to think about right now.Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"February 8, 2017",judge trump nominee court seat year twitter account trump branch government meeting today way disheartening obligation people abhorrent president trump judiciary someone bench attack attack trump system judge ban circuit court legality ban case time lawyer department justice government evidence ban question terrorism terrorism ban august trump authority area judge president decision regard court answer trump court part circuit trump radar decision court subject juvenile way trump confirmation hearing withdraw lot image
5081, Alabama Republican Governor BUSTED Lying To Congressman To Cover Up Affair (AUDIO),"They say the cover-up is always worse than the act itself, and Alabama Governor Robert Bentley is learning that lesson right now.The Republican governor has refused to resign and is currently facing impeachment because Bentley was caught on tape talking to Rebekah Mason, a staffer who works for him, about the extramarital affair they were conducting at the time with each other. I love you,  Bentley told Mason in the recording.  I love to talk to you. Baby, let me tell you what we re going to have to start doing, we re going to have to start locking the door. If we are going to do what we did the other day, we are going to have to start locking the door. Clearly, Bentley told Mason they ll have to lock the door because their relationship became physical andthe logical reason why they would have to start locking the door is so someone doesn t walk in on them and catch them in the act.The audio tape of Bentley and his mistress caused Bentley s wife to divorce him and as previously mentioned, the Alabama legislature has started impeachment proceedings against him.But now it appears that Bentley actually tried to cover up his affair by lying to a state lawmaker during a telephone call that was recorded.Alabama state Rep. Allen Farley caught Bentley on tape accusing the gambling industry in the state of spreading false allegations about him and Mason because he claims they were desperate enough to block his tax measures that they would sink to any low to do it. There is no affair going on,  Bentley claims in the audio recording. He then goes on to talk about Mason and how his wife is  jealous  of her and again denies that he is having an affair with her.The 25 minute phone call continues with Bentley denying that he ever used government money or the government plane to help him carry on the affair.Bentley then goes on to claim that there is a conspiracy against him orchestrated by the casino industry to force him to stop pursuing his tax agenda. Casino gambling people are feeding this story,  Bentley said.  These guys, let me tell you what they re most concerned about. They re most concerned about a lottery and me signing a compact with the Indians. That s what they re concerned about  That is the loaded gun right there. And they will do anything because these guys are poised to make hundreds of millions of dollars. Here s the audio via YouTube.So the plot has definitely thickened in this scandal and it looks like Bentley is in deep sh*t right now. He repeatedly lied about the affair before the first recording came out proving that he is a liar. And now we have a recording of Bentley flatly lying to a state congressman in an effort to cover up his affair by falsely accusing a major industry in Alabama of basically trying to blackmail him.If this isn t enough to result in Bentley s ouster the people of Alabama need to install a brand new state legislature.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 12, 2016",cover act governor governor impeachment tape mason staffer affair time mason recording door day door mason door relationship reason door someone walk act tape mistress wife legislature affair state lawmaker telephone call state rep tape gambling industry state mason tax affair audio recording mason wife affair minute phone call government money government plane affair conspiracy casino industry tax agenda casino people story lottery compact gun right anything millions audio plot scandal sh affair recording recording state congressman effort affair industry people need brand state legislature image

7956, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder Could Face Manslaughter Charges Over Flint Water Poisoning,"The people of Flint, Michigan are suffering from a man-made disaster, and someone should pay the consequences for it.A special investigator is looking into tragedy that has gripped the major Michigan community since 2014 when state officials chose to switch Flint s water supply from Lake Huron to the poisoned river.Ever since, there have been multiple cases of lead poisoning, and ten people have already died from Legionnaires  disease. Kids can now expect to deal with neurological issues as they get older because of the high levels of lead found in their bloodstream.Special Investigator Todd Flood has been brought in along with the former head of the Detroit FBI office and other former law enforcement officials to figure out who knew what and when they knew it. Flood says that manslaughter charges could be on the table. We re here to investigate what possible crimes there are, anything [from] involuntary manslaughter or death that may have happened to some young person or old person because of this poisoning, to misconduct in office,  Flood said.  We take this very seriously. Indeed, he should. The Flint River had been abandoned as a water source for decades by the city precisely because the water was known to be toxic and unsafe for human consumption. This is public knowledge and officials should have known better.But Governor Snyder, who has made it his personal mission to take over city after city and appoint  emergency  managers to do his bidding in an effort to save the state money, has ignored the crisis until very recently when he called it his  Katrina.  Switching to the river was a money-saving scheme that has now backfired into a multi-million dollar catastrophe.And Snyder s emails aren t exactly helping him avoid prison.As the Washington Post reports, emails have been released  showing that Snyder s office knew of the Legionnaires  outbreak more than nine months before the governor announced the problem this January. Snyder s office was even  heavily involved  in the vote the Flint City Council made to make the switch to the river.Perhaps most damning is Congressional testimony by EPA acting water chief, Joel Beauvais, who claimed Snyder and his agencies  ignored federal advice to treat Flint s water for corrosive elements, which are believed to have eroded old lead pipes and contaminated drinking water,  and that  the state delayed for months in telling the public about the health risks. Even Rachel Maddow has shamed Snyder and his administration for their actions and inactions that let the tragedy happen.But Snyder is not the only public official who should be held responsible for poisoning the residents of Flint. Multiple city and state officials ignored the unfolding tragedy for months and even had the nerve to tell residents that the drinking water was perfectly safe even as scientific testing revealed that wasn t the case.As Todd Flood and his team investigate the crisis alongside a federal team conducting a separate investigation of their own, we could end up seeing a line of public officials being handcuffed and fitted for an orange jumpsuit when all is said and done. And that includes Rick Snyder, who frankly should have resigned by now.Ultimately, the buck stops at his desk. He is responsible for protecting the citizens of the state and of overseeing the state health and environmental agencies. It s hard to believe that he knew nothing of this problem for two years.The people of Flint deserve justice. Those who have died because of this deserve justice. The kids who will likely grow up with severe neurological issues deserve justice. And if justice cannot be delivered to Flint, nothing stops public officials from being just as irresponsible in other states.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 21, 2016",people flint michigan man disaster someone investigator tragedy michigan community state flint water supply lake huron river lead poisoning people lead investigator flood head office law enforcement manslaughter table anything manslaughter death person person poisoning office flood flint river water source city water consumption knowledge mission city city emergency bidding effort state money crisis river money scheme dollar catastrophe prison post office knew governor problem office vote flint city council switch river testimony water chief advice water drinking water state public health administration tragedy official city state tragedy nerve drinking water case flood team crisis team investigation line orange buck desk state state health nothing problem people flint deserve justice deserve justice justice justice cannot nothing image
7982, ‘Pro-Life’ GOP Refuses To Help Zika Infected Babies,"The world is scrambling to deal with fallout from the spread of the Zika virus, the global pandemic which appears to be linked to birth defects in children when pregnant women are infected. President Obama has requested that America help lead the global effort to fight the infection   which has reached our shores. Republicans, who describe themselves as  pro-life,  are resisting.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) is taking the lead among Republicans in refusing to help.In a letter to President Obama s budget director, Shaun Donovan, Rogers noted the Department of Health and Human Services has $1.4 billion allocated for the Ebola fight of 2014. And the State Department has $1.3 billion left over. These funds can and should be prioritized to meet the most pressing needs of mounting a rapid and full response to Zika,  Rogers and two other Republican committee members wrote.The White House will likely ask that  some  Ebola funds be  repurposed  for the anti-Zika effort but not so much that it would  undermine  the response to Ebola, Earnest said, adding that amount  would not be sufficient to take on what we believe is a pretty serious threat from the Zika virus. Strangely Republicans are arguing that funds already being used to fight the Ebola outbreak now be used against Zika, instead of a separate request. But these are the same Republicans who attacked the Obama administration s response to that outbreak.Along with their allies in the media, many on the right said Obama was exposing America to Ebola, with some even floating the conspiracy theory that Obama wanted a mass infection of Americans with the Ebola virus.Instead, the administration s response to that outbreak has now been cited as a model of America using its superpower status to fight a global problem. Ebola infections are down to nonexistent in many of the African nations where it killed thousands, in part due to the global alliance organized by President Obama.There were no outbreaks of the disease in America, and in fact Americans infected with the virus survived and are now Ebola-free, thanks to American doctors. At the same time Republicans and conservatives were harsh in their condemnation of the Obama response.The Obama administration is asking for funds to show American leadership, to help the babies Republicans profess to care so much about, and again they are dropping the ball.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 19, 2016",world spread virus pandemic president effort infection life house committee chairman lead letter president budget director department health human fight state department funds needs response committee house funds effort response amount threat virus funds outbreak request administration response outbreak allies media right conspiracy theory mass infection virus administration response outbreak model superpower status problem part alliance president disease fact virus thanks time condemnation response administration funds leadership profess ball image
9619,BILL O’REILLY EMBARRASSES Megyn Kelly…Publishes Letters She Wrote Thanking Him For Being A “Dear Friend” and For “Years” of Support After She Bashed Him On Her Flailing NBC Morning Show [VIDEO],"Megyn Kelly is quite possibly the least popular host on television. She s also quite possibly one of the highest paid hosts on one of the lowest rated morning shows on television. In her desperate attempt to do just about anything for ratings, the very unlikeable host went after Fox News and the former top-rated host Bill O Reilly. Was Kelly s on-air letter an attempt to jump on Hollywood s anti-sexual harassment bandwagon? Was she hoping to endear herself to a more left-leaning audience, since she clearly has no hope of ever regaining the conservative fans she lost when she attacked then-candidate Trump during a FOX News hosted GOP primary presidential debate? The NBC News host made the reveal before welcoming former Fox News host and O Reilly accuser Juliet Huddy onto her Monday talk show.Former Fox News host Juliet Huddy spoke out for the first time about her accusations against Bill O Reilly and what women face when going up against a corporation on Monday s Megyn Kelly Today.During an opening segment about this weekend s report of new sexual harassment revelations against O Reilly, former Fox News host Kelly revealed that she, too, had complained about O Reilly s behavior. She said she understands the roadblocks women see when speaking out about sexual harassment, something an emotional Huddy explained as  You are just this one person about to go up against a machine. It s daunting and frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that Huddy said O Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 and that when she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career. Allegations included O Reilly calling Huddy repeatedly, sometimes sounding as if he were masturbating, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, he appeared at the door in his boxer shorts. In exchange for her agreement not to sue, she was paid a sum in the high six figures, though 21st Century Fox and O Reilly said her allegations were false.To open the show, Kelly made public for the first time a letter (below) she wrote to the co-presidents of Fox News about O Reilly, displaying the note she sent to Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy during the top of her show while discussing this weekend s Times report about a new sexual harassment settlement made by O Reilly. Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience,  Kelly said.  However, O Reilly s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained. Not so fast Megyn Bill O Reilly immediately revealed 2 handwritten letters from Megyn Kelly where she gushed all over him and how much she appreciated him on his website:My former FNC colleagues Megyn Kelly & Gretchen Carlson wrote me notes when we worked together. You can read them on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C  Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017Here are Kelly s letters to O Reilly: O Reilly even took it a step further and released a letter from sexual harassment accuser and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson:Here is Carlson s letter to O Reilly:Bill  Thank you for being the calm in the sea.Thank you so much for supporting me.Thank you for being my friend.It means the world to meGC[Gretchen Carlson]Megyn immediately got hammered on Twitter after O Reilly released her letters to him.

Ms. Bernal-Martinez describes herself as a  Radical Queer Progressive Educator  and  white-passing Xicana.

6927, Anderson Cooper SMACKS DOWN Trump For Whining About Colorado Rules: ‘Didn’t You Just Get Outplayed?’ (VIDEO),"It wouldn t be the first time CNN anchor Anderson Cooper has smacked down Trump, and he just gets better every time.Just last month, Cooper called Trump out on his childish behavior when the business mogul launched an immature, misogyny-fueled attack against rival Ted Cruz s wife. When Trump defended himself using a  he started it  argument, Cooper destroyed the Republican front runner by telling him,  That s the argument of 5-year-old.  And at last night s town hall, Cooper didn t disappoint.Cooper began the interview by criticizing Trump for his ridiculous complaints about the delegate voting system in Colorado. Ever since Cruz beat Trump in getting every last one of the 34 delegates  support in the state, Trump has been whining and moaning about how  unfair,   rigged  and  crooked  Colorado s system is. Cooper completely shut Trump down when he asked the sore loser, The rules are the rules, didn t you just get outplayed on the ground? Trump, continuing to insist that he was aware of the rules (even though he clearly wasn t), kept complaining that the voting system was some sort of anti-Trump conspiracy that was stacked against me.  Cooper wasn t having ANY of Trump s bullsh*t, and reminded him that Cruz had actually put time and effort into going out, reaching out to people who wanted to be delegates, to run the process  in Colorado   unlike Trump.Cooper told the business mogul,  You could ve had a better organization on the ground,  reminding him that he d had  months to prepare.  Cooper then called Trump out on his egotistical overestimation of himself and said: For somebody who touts himself as somebody who s an organizational genius, as someone who s created this amazing business organization, that you couldn t create an organization on the ground that could beat Ted Cruz s organization.

1842, Trump Builds Helipad At Mar-A-Lago So He Can Avoid Protesters While Golfing Each Weekend,"Trump s weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf course have repeatedly been met with crowds of protesters. Just yesterday, protesters surprised Trump by showing up on his route to his golf course despite the fact that he had tried to keep the trip a secret. How d they know? Unfortunately for Trump, protesters correctly guessed that just 48 hours after he kickstarted a war in Syria he would probably be back on his golf course.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017Trump clearly doesn t enjoy seeing reminders that his presidency is highly unpopular. This appears to be Trump s solution:The newest addition to Mar a Lago  a helipad and Trump chopper. pic.twitter.com/Hxb8QyR8Uu  Vivian Salama (@vmsalama) April 9, 2017Trump s administration claims the helipad was built to carry Trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic. They also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week. And like everything Trump does, the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby Trump s resort.When the proposal was first drawn up, it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area:Jesse H. Diner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Woodbridge Avenue resident Nancy deMoss, urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location. These are big helicopters, they re like flying tanks,  Diner said.DeMoss requires around-the-clock health care that has been impacted by Trump s weekend visits. Diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance, and she is uncomfortable with the U.S. Coast Guard boats sporting guns when Trump is in town.Trump went ahead with the plan anyway.Adding more absurdity, Trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend. The official Marine One, nor Trump, have used the helipad so far, but a giant helicopter with Trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot. Trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until Sunday   a shameless photo op attempt.It s also not clear whether Trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge Trump s golf obsession. The helipad was registered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation suggesting Trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s Mount Rushmore and not an excuse for Trump to take more vacations.If the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already $23 million Trump has spent taking vacations while president for just 11 weeks. At this rate, Trump is projected to eclipse Obama s entire cost of travel in just 10 months.It s for this reason that Trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  Southern White House  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president. It would be unsurprising to find that someday Trump renames the 18th hole at his Florida golf course after the Oval Office.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 9, 2017",trump weekend golf course yesterday trump route golf course fact trip trump war golf course pool group dozen resign loser impeach trump golf course griffin enjoy presidency solution addition trump chopper pic twitter administration trump airport resort traffic traffic resort time town week everything trump expense people trump resort proposal criticism area diner fort attorney avenue resident nancy project location diner clock health care trump weekend diner family nuisance coast guard trump town trump plan trump helicopter weekend marine helicopter trump name tail spot trump staff photo attempt trump trump golf obsession trust preservation trump site significance mount excuse trump cost addition trump president rate trump cost travel reason trump resort house order job president trump hole golf course office image twitter
1948, Trump Threatens To ‘Change Libel Laws’ To Sue People Who Criticize Him In Twitter Meltdown,"Here s another hole in the leaky ship that is the argument Trump shouldn t be taken  literally  when he makes threats. Trump has circled back to his campaign promise to make changes to libel laws that would allow him to go after journalists and news organizations which publish things he doesn t like. He held out for less than three months.Trump s rediscovered love of censorship comes on the heels of several straight days of Trump freaking out about the New York Times reporting on his various scandals. And it s probably no coincidence that Trump is reconsidering press freedom right as his approval rating hits historic lows (the worst since Nixon was impeached and a record low for any president at this stage in office).In a culmination of Trump s rant against the New York Times, he called for a change in libel laws and used an article written by the New York Post   a right-leaning daily owned by Rupert Murdoch   to pretend his troubles are due to the  liberal media  and not his own incompetence.The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws? https://t.co/QIqLgvYLLi  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017The article shows how thoroughly unserious it is just three sentences in when it repeats the lie that the New York Times  apologized  to readers for being so biased against Trump. The paper did no such thing. The only other person who routinely suggests that it did is none other than Trump himself. The relationship between the New York Post and Donald Trump is an orange-painted echo chamber.Trump s belief that he can pass libel laws to restrict what the press says about him is terrifying, but not original. He made similar remarks during the campaign. Here s Trump channeling a dictator in February 2016: One of the things I m going to do if I win, and I hope we do and we re certainly leading. I m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they re totally protected. As the old adage goes, he told us who he was, we should have believed him.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017",hole ship argument trump trump campaign promise news love censorship days trump york times coincidence trump press freedom approval rating record low president stage office culmination trump rant york times change libel article york post media incompetence failing media world march article lie york times paper thing person none trump relationship york post trump orange chamber trump belief libel press campaign trump dictator libel lots money york times hit piece disgrace post piece money chance adage image mark
449," Trump Brags About Hand Size While At Hurricane Shelter, And It’s Beyond Weird (VIDEO)","It s more than clear that Donald Trump is very proud of himself for visiting Texas for the second time after Hurricane Harvey. He s made sure to post videos of himself arriving, and the press is swarming him while he visits shelters housing displaced hurricane victims. Optics really are the best, right? Especially for plummeting approval ratings.However, in a very weird moment, the camera caught Trump talking about his hand size. That s right, Trump shouted: My hands are too big! Here s the video:Trump yells  my hands are too big! Not sure who he is talking to. pic.twitter.com/XpRsbRlhCc  Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 2, 2017Weird right? It s not really clear why he would say such a thing, or who he was saying it to. However, there he was, in the middle of a hurricane shelter, seemingly bragging about the size of his hands.If you re unaware, the size of Trump s hands has been an ongoing joke ever since the presidential race. The gag is that he has really tiny hands, or at least that s how rumor has it. So, overcompensating, he bragged about his hands then, and he s clearly still making sure people think his hands are plenty big enough for whatever it is he is doing at that shelter.Nonetheless, it s still weird and unnecessary to make sure he says such a thing on camera.

17313,PAMELA GELLAR GROUP PLANS TO RUN MUHAMMED CARTOON ADS ON DC BUSES [Video]," Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Because freedom of speech is under violent assault, the human rights advocacy group the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) has announced a new ad campaign to defend freedom of speech and stand up to violent intimidation kicking off in the nation s capital.I said in a statement:  Because the media and the cultural and political elites continue to self-enforce the Sharia without the consent of the American people by refusing to show any depictions of Muhammad or showing what it was in Texas that had jihadists opening fire, we are running an ad featuring the winning cartoon by former Muslim Bosch Fawstin from our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas. Let the American people see what the cowardly press is censoring in accordance with the blasphemy laws under the sharia (Islamic law).The ad campaign has been submitted to the Washington, D.C. MTA to run on buses and train dioramas in the Foggy Bottom, Capitol South, Bethesda, L Enfant Plaza, and Shady Grove stations. Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Either America will stand now against attempts to suppress the freedom of speech by violence, or will submit and give the violent the signal that we can be silenced by threats and murder. We cannot submit to the assassin s veto. It was the jihadis, not I, who made the cartoons a flash point. If we surrender on that point and stop drawing Muhammad, we ve established a precedent of surrendering to violent Sharia enforcement, and once established, we will be made to reinforce it again and again. Islamist government is a unique threat to free speech and libertyFreedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced.Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others.I added:  There is nothing about this cartoon that incites violence. It is within the established American tradition of satire. If America surrenders on this point, the freedom of speech is a relic of history. AFDI Vice President Robert Spencer stated:  Many people on both the Left and the Right are saying that we should do nothing to provoke Islamic fundamentalism. The immediate answer would seem to be that we should do nothing to provoke violent jihadis, that the prudent thing to do would be to avoid doing things that anger them. But if we did that, they would not they stop coming at us. Last September, an Islamic State spokesman boasted:  We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. This is His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise. If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market. In light of that, what is the point of asking whether or not we should provoke them? They re already provoked,  he continued.  A more useful question now is whether it is really productive and helpful to signal to them that we will acquiesce to their threats of violence and change our behavior accordingly, or whether we will instead signal to them that their violent threats are not going to frighten us into submission. The ads have been submitted to run on buses in Washington, D.C.AFDI stands for:The freedom of speech   as opposed to Islamic prohibitions of  blasphemy  and  slander,  which are used effectively to quash honest discussion of jihad and Islamic supremacism; The freedom of conscience   as opposed to the Islamic death penalty for apostasy; The equality of rights of all people before the law   as opposed to Sharia s institutionalized discrimination against women and non-Muslims.

23404,Ron Paul: ‘I Can’t Support Trump if He’s GOP Pick’ and ‘Neocons Will Love Hillary’," David Sherfinski Washington TimesFormer Texas Rep. Ron Paul said Friday he couldn t support GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump if Mr. Trump wins the party s nomination, saying Mr. Trump s views on the scope of executive authority could surpass those of President Obama. No, I couldn t do that, Mr. Paul said on Fox Business Network when asked if he would support Mr. Trump, should the billionaire businessman win the GOP nomination.  He s [the] opposite of a libertarian. Mr. Paul, a three-time presidential candidate, said on foreign policy, Mr. Trump probably wouldn t be that much different than former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. I think the die-hard neoconservatives would not be that extremely unhappy with Hillary, Mr. Paul said. Trump is going to be the most efficient [at] using the executive orders,  he said.

5215, Four-Year-Old Bursts Into Tears When She Learns Obama Is Leaving Office (VIDEO),"A few months ago, a story of a young African-American girl went viral on social media. The girl is a first grader named Kameria. She was devastated that President Obama would soon be leaving office and her tears appeared all over social media. Kameria isn t the only one. Another little girl s tears are going viral as she whimpers that she  will miss Obama. Abella Tomlin of Beaverton, Oregon, was in the backseat of her car and her mother was listening to the Democratic National Convention. Obama s the only president this four-year-old has ever known, but this was the first time she had to face the hard reality of term limits.The video starts off with Abella seeming to cry over whatever four-year-olds cry over. She asked her mother Andrea if she could watch a movie to  make (her) feel better.  Then, Andrea asked what was wrong and Abella cried,  I miss Obama. Andrea explained:  Abella has been an Obama fan since day one. She has grown up with him as a hero in our household, and as such has always talked about how much she loves him. I was just listening to the DNC speeches, and she asked me what they were talking about. So I explained to her that the country is getting ready to elect a new president. She immediately had tears running down her face and explained to me that Barack Obama was our president and how could we get a new one when we already had one. Source: Daily MailHere s the video: All is not lost for Abella, though. She thinks Hillary Clinton will be a good president.Andrea told Abella that maybe Obama should know how she feels, and she offered to send the President the video. Hopefully, as with Kameria, Abella will soon get an invitation to the White House.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 2, 2016",story girl media girl grader president office media girl car mother convention president year time reality term video year cry mother movie feel fan day hero household country president face president source video president president video invitation house image video screen capture
4349, Bernie Sanders And Elizabeth Warren Drop BOMBSHELL On Wall Street Execs,"The Department of Justice has begun their criminal probe into Wells Fargo over the firing of 5,300 employees after said employees were coerced into opening over 2 million unauthorized accounts in an effort to boost their stock prices.As the criminal probe begins, 14 Senators, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (whose video grilling CEO John Stumpf went viral) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking that the investigation primarily focus on executives with the company, not lower level employees:Every time the Department of Justice settles a case of corporate fraud without holding individuals accountable, it reinforces the notion that the wealthy and powerful have purchased a higher class of justice for themselves. That s why the Wells Fargo investigation is so important.  Last week s Senate Banking Committee hearing with Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf raised serious questions that demand additional answers and point to potential individual wrongdoing  We are not in a position to determine if any of the senior executives at Wells Fargo committed criminal conduct.  That is ultimately the job of the Justice Department and courts.  But these facts raise questions about whether senior executives, including Mr. Stumpf, knowingly allowed illegal conduct to continue.Senators who signed the letter are Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin, Al Franken, Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Angus King, Amy Klobuchar, Patrick Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Ron Wyden.Twelve Democrats and two Independents. Not a single Republican signed the letter.The letter states that Stumpf knew as early as 2013 that employees were opening up the illegal accounts but failed to disclose the information to investors and instead used the illegal accounts as a way to inflate stock prices. In other words, Stumpf was committing fraud.The end of the letter praises the actions taken by Warren s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but it still holds out hope that the DOJ will investigate executives personally:While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settlements in this case are a good first step toward providing restitution to Wells Fargo s customers, they are no substitute for a thorough Justice Department investigation into potential wrongdoing by senior executives at the bank.  We hope the Department follows through on its promise in the Yates memo and brings all the resources it has to bear on investigating the conduct of Wells Fargo s senior leadership.Sanders wrote a letter to regulators earlier, asking if any investigations against the executives personally were being conducted, saying,  Wall Street won t change until we make it clear that no bank is too big to fail and no CEO is too big to jail. So far, his questions remain unanswered. Hopefully, the letter sent by these progressive senators doesn t go unanswered.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",department justice probe firing opening effort stock probe sanders warren video letter attorney lynch investigation company level time department justice case fraud notion class justice investigation week senate banking committee chairman point wrongdoing position conduct job justice department conduct letter dick al jeff sanders warren twelve republican letter letter information way stock fraud end letter consumer protection bureau hope consumer protection bureau office comptroller currency case step restitution substitute justice department investigation wrongdoing bank department promise memo conduct leadership sanders letter street change bank letter image
2617, Sean Spicer Dreams Up Brand-New Fake Terrorist Attack To Defend Trump’s Muslim Ban,"As if we didn t already have enough proof that Trump s administration is full of pathological, compulsive liars, along comes Sean Spicer with yet more. It s not his defense of Kellyanne Conway s mysteriously non-existent terror attack at Bowling Green that lands him on the growing mountain of lies. Rather, it s that he himself has referenced an imaginary terror attack multiple times.CNN put together a short list of Spicer s references to a terror attack in Atlanta that never happened:The first timeHere s what Spicer told ABC s  This Week  on January 29 while defending the President s travel ban: What do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic (sic)   to whether it s Atlanta or San Bernardino or the Boston bomber? Those people, each of whom had gone out to a country and then come back,  Spicer said.The second timeThe next day, Spicer appeared on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and also mentioned Atlanta while defending the travel ban: There was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the United States were safe. Everybody s been protected,  Spicer said.  What happened if we didn t act and somebody was killed?   Too many of these cases that have happened   whether you re talking about San Bernardino, Atlanta   Boston   would you wait until you do? The answer is we act now to protect the future. The third timeAnd in his January 30 press briefing, Spicer once again alluded to an Atlanta terror attack. When asked by a reporter why some countries linked to terrorism aren t on the travel ban list, Spicer responded: Right, and we re reviewing the entire process over this period of time to make sure that we do this right. But I don t think you have to look any further than the families of the Boston Marathon, in Atlanta, in San Bernardino to ask if we can go further. CNN has been unable to reach Spicer for comment, but some speculate that he might actually be referring to Orlando. The only problem is, he keeps saying Atlanta and it s not like the Orlando massacre was a small, minor incident where such a misstep might be understandable. The last known terror attacks in Atlanta were at the 1996 Olympics, and at a lesbian club in 1997. Both happened at the hands of a right-wing American terrorist.In other words, they weren t attacks by radical Muslims. And there have been no other acts of terrorism in Atlanta. Yet here s Spicer, saying  Atlanta  over and over again to defend Trump s Muslim ban.The Orlando attack, by contrast, was a massacre, and it s not like nobody can remember it. Odd mistake to make, if that s what s even happening.Maybe he s talking about tighter security in Atlanta following last year s terror attack in Brussels? That s not especially likely, either. When he finally gets a story together, he ll talk to the press. Or he ll ignore anything that has to do with his references to Atlanta. But, like Kellyanne Conway, he said it, and then repeated it. It s hard to believe that s just a misspoken word.Read more:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"February 8, 2017",proof administration spicer defense terror attack mountain terror attack times list spicer terror attack spicer week president ban family somebody sic bomber people country spicer day spicer morning joe travel ban period time something people everybody spicer act somebody boston answer future press spicer terror attack reporter travel ban list spicer process period time right boston marathon spicer comment problem massacre incident misstep terror club wing terrorist terrorism spicer trump attack contrast massacre nobody mistake security year terror attack story talk press anything word image mark
17526,LYNCH MOB WINS By Less Than 1%…Why Republicans Are To Blame For LEFTIST DOUG JONES’ Victory,"They threw everything but the kitchen sink at Judge Roy Moore. Democrats outspent Moore 10-1, and more importantly, the Democrat Party unified, like they always do, to get behind their candidate (think Hillary Clinton), no matter their flaws, or how weak of a candidate he or she may be. Meanwhile, the Republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered, they argued amongst themselves, and they waited until the 11th hour to get behind Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who was accused (without evidence) by several women (one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him) of sexual misconduct several decades ago. The media will try to blame this loss on President Trump, but the truth of the matter is, that the Republican Party came late to the game with funding and with support for Roy Moore, while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate. The spineless Republican Party can take credit for the historic loss tonight in Alabama.AP   In a stunning victory aided by scandal, Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama s special Senate election on Tuesday, beating back history, an embattled Republican opponent and President Donald Trump, who urgently endorsed GOP rebel Roy Moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations.It was the first Democratic Senate victory in a quarter-century in Alabama, one of the reddest of red states, and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of Trump.

2255," While Everyone Was Distracted, Here Are Five Ways Trump Just Moved To F*ck Over Middle America","The Donald Trump administration is desperate and like a cornered wild animal, Trump is lashing out at everyone, hoping he ll land a bite that will stick. Over the weekend, the target of Trump s delusional Twitter rant was President Obama, who Trump accused of wiretapping him. There s zero evidence and even conservatives are beginning to question Trump s sanity.Now, I won t go so far as to say Trump is crazy like a fox   no, he s just plain crazy   but he also uses his Twitter account in an almost clever way. He uses it to distract from the real damage and flat out destruction he and his Republican cohorts are doing to this country.Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Inquirer outlined three ways in which Trump is giving the country a legislative middle finger and because of Trump s ridiculous tweets, the media is ignoring almost all of them.Donald Trump put as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a man who has sued the agency a total of 13 times. Trump wants to all but gut the agency, leaving us with filthy air, water and ultimately, food, but hey, those polluting industries will see hefty profits.No, the administration doesn t want to stop global warming. They just don t want us to study it or hear about it. In fact, they don t even want us to know about the weather. The administration wants to cut the funding of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency by more than half a billion dollars.In some ways, the second ban is worse than its predecessor. It signals that the Trump Administration is determined to pursue its anti-Muslim, extremist agenda and will not be hindered by courts   nor by the showing of public concern which followed the first ban. That remarkable cultural moment   symbolized by the immediate airport protests and sustained by the solidarity of faith groups, civil rights figures and celebrities who ve spoken out repeatedly over the last month   seems to have gone unheeded by the Trump Administration.Source: Time.comWe have a couple to add.This is true of Trump s tax proposals, which redirect wealth from the poor to the ultrarich. No one who supports repealing the estate tax can credibly be called a  populist.  It s also true about his health care proposals, which slash benefits for low-income people while cutting taxes on the well-to-do. And it looks like this pattern will hold with respect to Trump s forthcoming budget proposal, in which the  populist  president will ask for a big hike in defense spending while inflicting painful cuts on social programs.Source: SalonDonald Trump, Jr. told The Washington Post that he and his brother Eric were inspired by many places they visited while with their father on the campaign trail. While Trump has not divested from his company, he s turned over management of the Trump brand to his sons.

3220, Most Corrupt Presidential Lawyer In History Is Terrified Of Trump’s Lying,"John Dean knows something about corruption. He was the White House Council for Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. He was even prosecuted for his part. That s why we should heed his warnings about Donald Trump, who the former White House Council, accuses of being a liar, and worse.Dean, who s apparently been paying attention to Trump and to Trump s overall ignorance of anything when it comes to matter of state, tweeted on Thursday that Trump is an idiot and a liar. Okay, that first word is mine, but the meaning is the same: It is deeply troubling when you realize that the president-elect generally does not know what he is talking about,  Dean tweeted. And when he does he lies. It is deeply troubling when you realize that the president-elect generally does not know what he is talking about and when he does he lies.  John Dean (@JohnWDean) December 29, 2016Dean is far from the first person to note that Trump is a habitual liar. Even his own lawyers say he s a liar. In fact, according to a deposition from 1992, Trump s lawyers had to double up during that bankruptcy hearing since Trump can t be trusted. We tried to do it with Donald always if we could because Donald says certain things and then has a lack of memory,  attorney Patrick McGahn said during the deposition in transcripts obtained by BuzzFeed.As McGahn explained,  It s always been our practice to make sure that two people are present, and we don t have a problem of people lying.  He added that Trump is an  expert at interpreting things. Let s put it that way.

Actually, all we have to do is go back a few months for a hint at that. In an interview in the Washington Post with Watergate journalist Bob Woodword, Trump had some misgivings about Nixon, but they weren t about his dishonesty:Nixon failed, I think to a certain extent, because of his personality. You know? It was just that personality. Very severe, very exclusive. In other words, people couldn t come in. And people didn t like him. I mean, people didn t like him.When pressed about the fact that Nixon broke the law, Trump shrugged it off, speculating that it was  insecurity.  According to Trump, it was  hate  that destroyed Nixon, not dishonesty. Ironically, he sees no lessons in Nixon s legacy. Trump, along with being a habitual liar, seems to think of himself as someone who s very likable and not at all (swallow your drink before reading this next word) vindictive, and that, according to him, will save him, lies or not.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"December 30, 2016",dean something corruption house council scandal part trump house council liar dean attention ignorance anything matter state trump idiot word meaning president dean president person trump liar liar fact deposition trump bankruptcy trump lack memory attorney deposition practice people problem people trump expert way source trump plaza bankruptcy case lawyer trump pic twitter trump role model hint interview post journalist bob trump extent personality personality people people people fact law trump insecurity hate legacy trump liar someone drink word vindictive image mark

Trump supporters were chanting because after decades of evading the law, Americans were quite serious about expecting candidate Donald Trump to follow through on his campaign promise to hold her accountable, and make her pay for her crimes, just like any other American would be expected to do.

9531,NAMES REVEALED Of TOP DONOR And Popular ACTRESS Behind Disgusting Leftist Latino TV Ad Depicting White Man Running Down Minority Kids With Truck,"When a disgusting ad appeared on TV showing a white man in a pick-up truck with a confederate flag in the back, and an Ed Gillespie for Governor bumper sticker on the gate, that was chasing down a group of minority kids in their neighborhood, Americans from every political party were disgusted. Many were asking who in the world was behind the Latino Victory Fund that sponsored the disgusting ad? Well, Washington Free Beacon did some digging, and as it turns out, the same person who funds violent riots, Antifa anti-free speech uprisings, or violent anti-Trump protests is also behind the funding of this horrible and divisive group whose co-founder is a well-known leftist actress. Liberal billionaire George Soros is a major funder of a Latino activist group that produced an ad in Virginia depicting a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie running down minority children in a truck, which was pulled following the New York City terror attack that left eight people dead.The group was part of Soros-backed efforts against Trump and Republicans during the 2016 election cycle, and its leadership includes individuals who previously worked directly with Soros at his foundation.The Latino Victory Fund, a group that carries a mission of  growing Latino political power by increasing Latino representation at every level of government,  released the advertisement showing a man driving a pickup truck with a Gillespie campaign bumper sticker chasing minority children down streets and alleyways.  Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by  the American dream?'  the voiceover says in the ad.Crist bal J. Alex, the president of the Latino Victory, said the ad was produced to show how Gillespie has  eagerly embraced racism and xenophobia  during the campaign. The group pulled the ad following the terror attack in New York City on Tuesday and issued a non-apology when announcing the move. We knew our ad would ruffle feathers,  Alex said in a statement late Tuesday night.  We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time. Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia. Here s the disgusting ad:Latino Victory was co-founded by actress Eva Longoria and San Antonio-based businessman Henry R. Mu oz III, who has chaired the DNC s finance committee since 2013. Longoria and Mu oz previously operated the Futuro Fund, which raised $32 million for Barack Obama s reelection efforts.Soros is the top individual donor to the Latino Victory Fund this year and has given $150,000 to the group, Federal Election Commission filings show. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, also gave $150,000 to the Latino Victory Fund.Soros produced funding for a campaign last year that involved the group.Numerous immigration activist groups, including Latino Victory, the Center for Community Change, and America s Voice, launched  Families Fight Back  during the 2016 election cycle.The Washington Free Beacon recently obtained unredacted tax documents revealing donors for the Center for Community Change, which does not disclose their contributors. Soros gave millions in funding to the group. It also received funding from the likes of the Ford Foundation, which was first created by members of the Ford Motor Company, but is no longer connected to the company.Three others who work at Latino Victory came from the failed presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.

1530," Trump Explains Why He Fired James Comey, F*cks Up And Admits He Should Be Impeached (VIDEO)","After kicking the morning off with a tweet storm attacking Democrats for criticizing his choice to fire FBI Director James Comey, Trump only seemed to make matters worse as the day went on.While meeting with pool reporters in the White House, Trump gave a public explanation for the termination of Comey, and accidentally made himself look horrible in the process. Keeping his message short and sweet, Trump said that the reason he fired Comey was because: He wasn t doing a good job, very simply. He was not doing a good job. You can watch that baffling moment below, where Trump cluelessly insults himself and ignored every question about Russia before kicking all the reporters out:That s certainly a strange thing for Trump to say, because by now he must know that his own approval rating is historically low and it continues to plummet with every failure his administration suffers. If Trump agrees that an FBI Director can be fired for their poor performance, it only makes sense that the same should apply to Trump.There s overwhelming evidence that Trump s job performance sucks   and it s not just his disastrous approval rating or the fact that polls show that most Americans want him out. From Trump s failed Muslim travel ban to his disgusting American Health Care Act (Trumpcare), Trump s first 100 days have been filled with failure after failure. There have been several times where Trump had to resort to taking credit for former President Barack Obama s work just to save his image.America is so much worse off now that Trump is in the White House, and if the country has to suffer through the rest of his term, the damage may be irreversible by the time we get a more qualified POTUS. But today, Trump accidentally said those magic words: if Comey can be fired for doing a bad job, so should he.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017",morning tweet storm choice director day pool house trump explanation termination process message trump reason job job moment trump question russia thing trump approval rating failure administration trump director performance sense evidence trump job performance approval rating fact trump travel ban health care act trump days failure failure times trump credit president work image trump house country rest term damage time today job image pool
5358, Watch Rudy Giuliani Forget He Was The Mayor Of NYC During 9/11 (VIDEO),"Appearing on Fox News, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to make the bold claim that the world is more dangerous than ever after citing shootings like Orlando. He even went so far as to say: Do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this? I don t. It s like, c mon man, you were the mayor of NYC during 9/11/01, but I get it, that happened under a Republican president, and you don t want to dare insinuate your own party is weak on terror. Got it.Now, to be completely honest, it s not so much that Giuliani  forgot  he was mayor of NYC during the worst terrorist attack on American soil, but he seems to be playing completely ignorant to that fact, and is just trying to throw President Obama and Hillary Clinton under a bus.To his credit (of which he should get none) he did mention 9/11 in passing, but as if only to glaze over the fact that it was a terrorist attack on our nation, but he seems to think that what s happening now is worse than the day nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives.His political pandering clearly knows absolutely no bounds, and should enrage us all.Watch Giuliani go on Fox News to feign complete ignorance here.Giuliani: ""Do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this?

6696, Watch Hillary Clinton And Rachel Maddow Brilliantly Handle Protester Who Disrupted MSNBC’s Town Hall,"On Monday evening, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both sat down with Rachel Maddow for a town hall style interview to try to pick up any undecided voters who may be left before Tuesday s primaries. During Clinton s interview, a protester interrupted to yell out a question, but instead of becoming irritated, Hillary and Rachel handled the protestor with the dignity they deserved.A female protester stood up and yelled something about women in immigration detention. Now, if this had happened in a Republican town hall meeting, the women would have been immediately escorted out and possibly beaten if Trump s supporters were there. None of that happened here. Rather than treat the women like an annoyance, Maddow repeated the woman s question and Clinton answered it.The transcript from MSNBC documented the incident:QUESTION: (OFF MIKE) the lives of the women that are (inaudible) right now?MADDOW: This is outside of our forum (ph). Let me just rephrase the question for you. Tell me if I get it right. Asking about women and families in family   immigration detention facilities.CLINTON: Yes, I m against that. Absolutely I m against that. I ve been against it for a long time. I ve said we should have family detention. We should end private prisons and private detention centers. They are wrong. We should end raids and roundups, and when I am president we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. So we will end all of these problems at the time we are successful.By taking the protester seriously and not becoming angry, Hillary Clinton showed the audience (both at the venue and at home) that she cares about the issues that are weighing on the voters in this country. She could have just ignored this woman, but she showed her the respect she deserved by giving her an answer to the question she yelled out. And it wasn t a bullshit answer just to shut her up, it was clearly something she has thought about and wants to fix.Hillary Clinton acted presidential last night and it was great.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 26, 2016",sanders town hall style interview interview protester question protestor dignity protester something immigration detention town hall none annoyance woman question transcript question forum question family immigration detention time family detention detention president immigration reform path time protester audience venue home country woman respect answer question answer something night watch image video
21567,THE LIST OF WHO’S WHO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FAILED EU AUSTERITY EXPERIMENT IN GREECE,"Like a spoiled child on a spending spree with no parental guidance, Greece is forced to sell some of the most beautiful real estate in the world on the cheap Wealthy foreign investors are expected to buy up Greek islands in coming months as Monday s bailout will likely force hard-hit rich Greek moguls to dump their piece of paradise. This  fire sale  of private Greek islands to  bargain hunters  is expected to take place over the next few years, according to property agent Knight Frank.Greece imposed the first-ever real estate tax last year to raise cash for creditors, making property ownership prohibitively expensive, according to Knight Frank s Island Report.Foreign investors are taking advantage of the falling property prices, which have plunged by 30 percent over the last five years thanks to Greece s debt crisis. Here are some island hunters who hoped to profit from Greece s woes:Russian billionaire s daughter buys Skorpios for ~$150 million Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the daughter of Russian billionaire and former owner of Russia s largest potassium fertilizer producer Dmitry Rybolovlev, reportedly bought the island for $150 million in 2013. Skorpios was owned since 1962 by shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis and served as the location of his wedding to Jackie Kennedy. His daughter eventually sold it to Rybolovleva, although it was reported that Madonna and Bill Gates had expressed interest in scooping it up.Qatari Emir buys six Greek islands for $9.4 million If you can t afford Skorpios, buy a half a dozen other islands. That s what Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani did in 2013 when Rybolovleva reportedly wouldn t lower her asking price for Skorpios. Al Thani planned to use the islands exclusively for his 24 children and three wives, The Guardian reported.Brangelina looking at $4.7 million island Gaia Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie wanted their six children to run around in peace without the paparazzi, news outlets reported in June. The 43-acre island secured planning permission for six villas back in June, The Washington Post reported.Chinese construction magnate buys island for $770,000 In a bidding war of 48 Chinese investors in March, a Greek island up for auction on Taobao (China s eBay) was nabbed by a construction tycoon from China s Yunnan province, International Business Times reported. The same man also reportedly bought a Canadian island for 1.7 million yuan, or $273,985.Dozens of other Greek islands are listed on Private Islands Online, with more expected to crop up as once-wealthy owners are forced to liquidate their assets. A 54-acre Stroggilo Island, with  a perfect 110 meters beach that can easily transform to a heaven on earth place for vacations,  is available for the paltry sum of $4.5 million.Via: VocativGreece could exist outside the euroAdmittedly, it would mean yet more hardship and austerity, but maybe one day they would be able to use the freedom having their own currency would give them to rebuild a more competitive economy. It worked for Britain. That said, their euro currency debt would immediately rise in real-terms value against any New Drachma, and would make the debt burden even worse. Default would be inevitable; as it may be anyway.Even if they got their debts entirely written off, it would all start over again before longThis is the fundamental point. Greece was living beyond her means after the euro was introduced; taking advantage of the cheap interest rates on the euro bestowed by its status as a strong currency backed by Germany. They had a great big party, buying all those nice German cars and the consumer digital wonders of the noughties; and now the hangover is still taking time to work through. There is no reason to believe that such reforms as there have been in Greece will be enough to enable Greeks to live comfortably within their means. The debts will pile up and the crisis will return. Syriza has no policies to make Greece competitive with say the Slovaks or Poles, let alone Korea and China.

9255,ARE SENATOR AL FRANKEN and REP JOHN CONYERS Being Sacrificed By The Democrat Party For A Much Larger Goal?,"After two days of being criticized by mostly female, (and even some male) members of Congress, over multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, Democrat Al Franken just announced he s resigning from his US Senate seat. Democrat Representative John Conyers met a similar onslaught of criticism from fellow House members earlier in the week, which left him feeling isolated from his own party as he faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, misconduct and even accusations of a veiled death threat by one woman.After years of looking the other way while numerous women courageously stepped forward to accuse former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and even rape, Democrats not only looked the other way, they nominated his wife who was accused by the same women of enabling his behavior as their choice for President of The United States.So why the sudden outrage over Franken and Conyers? Could it have something to do with the upcoming election for Senator in Alabama, where hard-core conservative Republican Judge Roy Moore appears to be ahead in the polls against Democrat candidate Doug Jones, despite being accused by several women of sexual misconduct that took place decades ago? So far, the motives or tactics of almost every one of Moore s accusers has been called into question. But this is not just any race, it s a race that the Democrats have dumped millions into, in hopes of taking a Senate seat they would otherwise have no chance of gaining in a deeply red state that overwhelmingly went for Trump in 2016. Democrat Senate candidate Doug Jones has never run for political office, opposes tax cuts for the rich and supports an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. The 63-year-old also is staunchly pro-choice, putting him at odds with embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who is staunchly pro-life.There s one thing we know about the Democrats they know how to fight. If the Democrats can make an 11th-hour show of how  moral  they are, because they are suddenly able to rally against sexual predators in leadership roles in their party (even though they spent decades ignoring the Clinton s, or the biggest elephant in the room) perhaps they can convince voters to support Democrat Doug Moore over the  moral-less  Republican-backed candidate Roy Moore, and gain a Senate seat they could only have dreamed about 6 months ago. The Democrats haven t won a senate seat in Alabama since 1992.Let s face it, Senator Franken resides in a solidly blue state who went for Hillary in 2016. There s not much likelihood that they ll elect a Republican to replace him. When it comes to the 88-year old Conyers, he s not only nearing the end of his career, he s a representative in Detroit, where it doesn t matter who runs as long as they have a (D) behind their name. It s a 100% safe seat.So if sacrificing a few members of their own party means gaining a Senate seat, it s all worth it, right? After all, the media wouldn t dare call out their allies in the Democrat Party for their decades of hypocrisy, and for their undying support of accused rapist Bill Clinton and his lovely, enabling wife Meanwhile, the blue state of Minnesota still loves Al Franken:Minnesota s Star Tribune calls Senator Al Franken (D-MN)  A star in his party After eight years in the Senate, Franken had emerged as a powerful voice on progressive causes and forceful critic of the Trump administration, frequently generating national headlines with aggressive questioning of Trump s Cabinet officers. He was a star attraction for the Democratic Party, raising millions of dollars for candidates around the country and appearing frequently on nationally broadcast talk shows and in other high-profile venues.Franken s celebrity preceded his political career. He was hired as a staff writer for  Saturday Night Live  in its first season in 1975 and quickly became a regular on-air performer as well. He served two long stints on the show s staff, the second ending in 1995. After that, he published several bestselling books of political satire from a liberal point of view and hosted a nationally syndicated radio show for several years.Franken, who had been a vocal champion of women s rights and a popular, in-demand spokesman for various progressive causes, found himself caught up in a growing cultural movement around outing bad behavior toward women by men in positions of power. By abandoning Franken along with former U.S. Rep. John Conyers, who resigned earlier this week, Democrats are drawing a distinction between their party and Republicans at a time when President Trump has thrown his full weight behind Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, accused of sexual abuse of underage girls.A Democratic source told the Star Tribune that Dayton is likely to appoint Lt. Gov. Tina Smith and that she is not expected to run in the special election.88-year old Representative John Conyers (D-MI) was the longest-serving House Member in US history.

13637,DEM OPPOSES EBT FRAUD BILL….Busted For EBT Fraud,"An Arizona Democratic lawmaker who once voted against welfare fraud protections in her state has been indicted on felony charges of defrauding the food stamp program.According to the indictment unsealed earlier this week, state Rep. Cecilia Velasquez was charged with three felony counts: unlawful use of food stamps, fraudulent schemes and practices, and theft.The Arizona Department of Economic Security began investigating Velasquez in 2014. According to the Arizona DES, Velasquez fraudulently used $1,726 worth of food stamps between 2013 and 2015.This past February, Velasquez had voted against a bill aimed at giving the same state agency stronger anti-fraud tools   a program that could have quickly detected her alleged fraudulent activity.Arizona state Rep. Anthony Kern, who sponsored the House bill, called the indictment  sad. It is appalling that an elected official representing the people of Arizona would steal from the poor, while consistently saying she is trying to help the poor.

7421, Right-Wing Terrorist Planned To Overthrow West Virginia Government With Violent Coup,"This is what Republicans have created by embracing right-wing extremism. They own this.In a plot that would have made the Bundy standoff in Oregon look like a schoolyard brawl in comparison, right-wing extremist Thomas David Deegan called for seizing the West Virginia state government by force and then executing several state leaders after a kangaroo court hearing presided over by so-called sovereign citizens.Deegan was busted after the conference call he made calling for right-wing extremists to launch a violent armed attack on the state capitol building was acquired by law enforcement. After listening to the recordings, it only took the jury an hour to come back with a guilty verdict. We are at war,  Deegan said during one call.  The more that come to Charleston, the less [likelihood] for bloodshed. If you see the police coming and pulling up in a vehicle, I suggest you shoot them. Again, this is the extremism that the Republican Party has built. They have literally been validating, excusing, and glorifying conservative extremism for decades. And now they have even invited extremists to become part of the mainstream which is why Donald Trump is about to win the GOP presidential nomination and why we see violence at his rallies on a consistent basis.Rather than condemn right-wing extremists, Republicans welcomed them and now they feel more emboldened then ever before, which is why the Bundy family was able to engage in two standoffs with the federal government in three years and why the number of right-wing terrorist groups has risen in recent years.Make no mistake, this could have ended up as a full blown domestic terrorist attack by right-wing extremists against a state government, and while Deegan s plot failed, you can bet that there are other right-wing extremists and right-wing groups that are quietly cooking up some future takeover effort with all the new shiny guns Republicans are letting them have by the weakening of gun laws. And next time Republicans could really have blood on their hands.Featured image: Wikimedia",News,"March 18, 2016",extremism plot standoff look schoolyard brawl comparison state government force state court hearing sovereign conference call wing violent attack state building law enforcement jury hour verdict war call likelihood police vehicle extremism party extremism part trump nomination violence basis bundy family government number mistake attack state government plot wing effort weakening gun time blood image

It caused a battle between pro-cop and anti-cop Congressman a few months ago.Well, it s baaaack Rep.

He blamed Republicans for  acts of theft  after GOP lawmakers took it down a few times in protest.Clay complained on the floor that the painting was removed in an act of  politically motivated, unconstitutional retroactive censorship. He was joined on the floor by other Democrats, including Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who called the painting a  pretty amazing  piece of art. PRETTY AMAZING ? This painting is a disgrace!

It was one of 400-plus winning entries in the Congressional Arts Competition.It was on display for more than seven months, but the Capitol architect removed the painting last month after some lawmakers complained.Congressman William Lacy Clay s office says he will file a suit Tuesday in response to what he claims is the  arbitrary and unconstitutional disqualification and removal  of the painting.THE PAINTING CAME DOWN AFTER MUCH BACK AND FORTH:The painting in the Capitol building at the center of controversy  because it depicts the police as pigs will FINALLY COME DOWN!Missouri Democrat Lacy Clay has been in a tug of war with Republicans over whether it should hang in the hallway connecting the House office buildings to the Capitol.

6046, Trump Responds To Devastating Clinton Attack By Slamming Her Looks,"After former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unloaded on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a major foreign policy speech on Thursday, the candidate responded not with substance or facts, but with a petulant tirade focused on how Clinton looks and sounds. That was a phony speech,  the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said at a rally in San Jose, Calif.  That was a Donald Trump hit job. His response to Mrs. Clinton s speech seemed to focus more on style than substance. She does not look presidential,  he said.  My temperament is so much tougher and so much better than her temperament. He crowned the Democratic front-runner with the insulting title he has long reserved for former rival Sen. Ted Cruz, whom he called  Lyin Ted. Lying, crooked Hillary,  he said at the rally.  She made up my foreign policy. In her speech, which many observers described as the best she has delivered in the campaign, Clinton picked apart Trump s extreme rhetoric point-by-point. She plainly explained that  like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job. She described his ideas as  bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,  and said he is  not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  because  it s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. Clinton went on to describe President Obama s decision to make the call to kill Osama bin Laden as  as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I ve ever seen  and contrasted that with  Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States.  She concluded,  making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. Trump didn t respond to Clinton s speech on substance, nor did he address the points she made about the style of his decision making. Instead he went after how she looks and speaks.

6885, Israeli PM Netanyahu Quoted In Full Throated Support of Ethnically Cleansing Palestinians,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always advocated for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, but has dressed himself up as someone who wants peace, all the while continuing to steal Palestinian land for Jewish settlements and to deny Palestinians their civil and political rights on lands in which Israel controls. In a November, 1989 speech, Netanyahu said: Israel should have exploited China s suppression of the demonstrations [Tienanmen Square], at a time when the world s attention was devoted to events in that country, in order to conduct mass expulsions of the Arabs [sic] of the Occupied Territories. However, to my sorrow, they [government ministers] didn t support the policy I espoused and whose implementation I continue to recommend. Most of the world knows Netanyahu is not a peace maker. Yet, Israeli apologists will argue that if only Israel would elect someone from other  moderate  parties in Israel, then he/she would take a softer stance on Palestinians and thus peace could be achieved. However, those who believe this nonsense are naive. Israel has a deep rooted culture of ethnic cleansing that dates back to the early Zionists and it is at the very core of today s Israel.When the first Zionist delegation came to Palestine from Europe in the 19th century looking to colonize the country and create their Jewish state, they declared that the  Bride is beautiful but she s married to another man,  meaning that there was already an existing people and culture in the country   the Palestinians. However, that didn t stop the Zionists from pursuing their agenda of wanting to create a Jewish state despite the fact that 97% of the population wasn t Jewish. We must keep in mind that the ideology of Zionism advocates not only for a Jewish state but the state must be majority Jewish. Thus, a major dilemma for the Zionists was how to create a majority Jewish state in a country where the majority of the population wasn t Jewish. The answer was to bring European Jews to the country on the one hand and to pursue the policy of ethnically cleansing Palestinians on the other.That Zionist culture of ethnic cleansing came into fruition in 1948. Despite massive European Jewish immigration into the country for 50 years, the Jewish population never reached a majority, accounting for about 30% of the population. Thus, in order to attain the majority Jewish state, David Ben-Gurion, who would later become Israel s first prime minister, unleashed Operation Plan Dalet, a campaign of ethnic cleansing that saw the destruction of hundreds of villages and the forced expulsion of close to a million Palestinians out of the country. Today, they and their descendants number in the millions.In 1967, Israel conquered the remaining 20% of Palestine, taking the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite the fact that close to 300,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed, the majority managed to remain on their lands and today the West Bank s 2.5 million Palestinians are a thorn in the side of the Zionists who have been building settlements in the heart of Palestinian communities throughout the West Bank and thirst for more Palestinian land. The United Nations considers Israel s presence in the West Bank and Gaza to be illegal and their building of settlements to be in violation of the fourth Geneva Conventions. Yet, Israel continues building, confiscating lands, blowing up Palestinian property to make way for Israeli expansion and then killing Palestinians when they complain and labeling them as terrorists when they resist.Calls for the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians continues to this day. While Netanyahu is currently the prime-minister, a new generation of Israelis have called for the violent removal of Palestinians. The calls for crimes against humanity are thus not isolated to a few politicians in Israel but are at the very fabric of the ideology of Zionism and its adherents.

6568, John McCain’s 2008 Top Campaign Adviser Abandons GOP Over Trump: ‘I’m With Her’ Instead,"A lot has changed in just eight years. The Republican Party is witnessing a collapse that may destroy it entirely. And nobody knows it on a more personal level than Mark Salter, Sen. John McCain s former campaign adviser and long-time friend. On the eve of the Indiana primary, in which all signs point to Donald Trump shattering the last resistance to his nomination, Salter took stock of his party   and bailed.In a tweet that may signal the coming flood of political refugees pouring out of the Republican Party s sinking ship, Salter said that Trump s antics and the GOP s idiotic responses to them have finally settled the matter. In a bold move, he concluded he would be supporting Hillary Clinton instead.the GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her.  Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) May 3, 2016Forget  loyalty pledges.  Forget standing with the party. Forget coming together to beat the Democrats. There is nothing redeeming about standing with Donald Trump.The last straw was Trump s use of a ludicrous story published by the tabloid (and Trump backer) National Enquirer, which alleged that Ted Cruz s dad was friends with Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy. The story was patently bonkers, but it didn t stop Trump and his supporters from  just asking questions  about it. This included Fox News.On the conservative network s Fox and Friends, the hosts remained silent and deferential as Trump suggested   quite seriously   that Rafael Cruz was somehow implicated in the JFK assassination. Apparently nobody at the network wanted to risk angering the Republican front-runner and potentially losing a ratings gold mine. The inmates are running the asylum.Cowardice and stupidity have become so entwined in the Republican Party that an entire day can be consumed by a false story printed by the NATIONAL ENQUIRER just because Donald Trump brought it up. It s no wonder some conservatives are looking at the wreckage of their party and deciding it s not even worth saving.Salter isn t exactly a bleeding heart liberal either. Having attached himself to McCain s campaign in 2008 as the senator s speechwriter and  closest aide, he s spent the last eight years bitterly attacking Obama and Democrats for the crime of beating his friend. The fact he s now saying  enough  must be terrifying for Republican operatives. If just a small fraction of Republicans abandon the party because of Trump, the general election may end in a landslide for Clinton.For months there has been questions about what the  Never Trump  coalition of Republicans would do if Trump won the nomination. Many are beginning to walk back their earlier comments. A number of them appear to be drawing the opposite conclusion. If  Never Trump  is to mean anything, than Hillary Clinton is the better option. Mark Salter seems to think so.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",lot party collapse nobody level mark salter sen campaign adviser time friend eve primary point trump resistance nomination salter stock party tweet flood party ship salter trump matter move president guy enquirer level mark salter loyalty party forget nothing straw use story tabloid trump backer enquirer dad man story trump news network fox trump assassination nobody network front runner gold asylum cowardice stupidity party day story enquirer trump wonder wreckage party salter heart liberal campaign senator aide crime friend fact fraction party trump election landslide coalition nomination number conclusion trump anything option mark salter image chip

3899, MSNBC Host Actually CHOKES While Saying Giuliani Could Be Attorney General (VIDEO),"Republican nominee Donald Trump has finally made some decisions on a few of his Cabinet members if he wins the election tomorrow, and it s almost just as depressing as imagining him getting into the White House. Following the theme of giving the most offensive GOPers more power, Trump has decided that New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani deserves to be his Attorney General.When MSNBC reported on Trump s list of bigot helpers, host Tamron Hall could barely get the words out about Giuliani. When she tried to deliver the news about the former NYC mayor, she choked up and coughed, making it hard to actually complete her sentence. Hall said: New this morning, Trump campaign sources tell NBC News among those being considered to serve in a Trump administration. Rudy Giuliani for Attorney General, excuse me Hall tried to move on and talk about Newt Gingrinch being chosen as Trump s Secretary of State, but she was already coughing. She recovered quickly, perhaps putting the shock and disgust of Giuliani s new position on the back burner for now, and went through the rest of Trump s choices with zero issues.You can watch Hall get sick to her stomach over the Giuliani news below:Having Giuliani as a major help to Trump in the White House is terrifying. He s not only defended Trump s racism, misogyny and other offensive comments by the business mogul, but he s also been caught lying a fairly good amount. Giuliani is basically just like Trump, and giving both of these idiots more power is just about the worst decision that America could make in this election. This isn t just about Trump anymore   it s about the future of America, and making sure that more of these clueless GOPers don t gain more influence than they already have.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"November 7, 2016",nominee trump cabinet election tomorrow house theme power trump york city mayor attorney general trump list bigot hall news mayor sentence hall morning trump campaign news administration attorney trump secretary state shock disgust position back burner rest trump stomach news help house racism misogyny business amount trump power decision election trump future gain influence image
21104,"EYE-OPENING: Why Liberals Won’t Talk About White, Poverty-Stricken, Rural Americans","This is a story you will never find in the mainstream media What seldom gets talked about and when it is, often with irreverent humor and contempt is the poverty of rural America, particularly rural white America: Appalachia, the Ozarks, the Mississippi Delta, the Dakotas, the Rio Grande Valley, the Cotton Belt.If you spend time among coastal liberals, it s not unusual to hear denigrating remarks made about poor  middle Americans  slip out of mouths that are otherwise forthcoming about the injustices of poverty and inequality.Yet, since the 1950s, Americans living in non-metropolitan counties have had a higher rate of poverty than those living in metropolitan areas. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the poverty rate among rural-dwelling Americans is three percent higher than it is among urban-dwellers. In the South, the poorest region of the country, the rural-urban discrepancy is greatest around eight percent higher in non-metro areas than metro areas.Watch here, as Levi Holstein, 22 explains what Obama s shut down of the coal industry has done to his community: Holstein s youth was spent hunting deer,turkey and bears,fishing for catfish with his father and riding four wheelers through the hills of Boone County. Now,the mountains he grew to love have been leveled in pursuit of coal,and their debris scraped into the hollow above his childhood home,destroying old haunts. I would be the first to tell you I hate strip mines. I hate it,I don t like it one bit,  Holstein said.  But at the same time it gives a man a job. Unfortunately, for 8 years we had a President who was committed to shutting down the coal industry in rural America, where primarily low income white families live.For Holstein,and many others throughout the region,the changes to the landscape and negative environmental impacts are weighed against paychecks to support their families. However,in the past few years career miners have seen their jobs vanish or move to other parts of the state.Once the most formidable industry in West Virginia,coal is progressively losing its economic dominance throughout Central Appalachia as production slows due to tightening pollution controls,greater availability of cheap natural gas and growing competition from other coal basins.From 2007 to 2012 West Virginia s annual coal production dropped by 31.7 million tons annually,falling over 20 percent,from 165.7 million to 129.5 million. Over half of that decline,17.9 million tons,came from Boone County,which until 2012 had long been the state s top producer.So why is the poverty of rural America largely unexamined, even avoided? There are a number of explanations.Rural and urban poverty are similar to the degree that both occur when people do not have access to jobs specifically ones that pay a living wage (i.e. enough to provide themselves and their dependents with basic necessities like food and shelter). Many of the causal factors for poverty, however, are exacerbated in remote areas where the job and labor markets are smaller and less diverse, and communities lack the human capital of city economies. Often a single industry (in some cases single employer) will dominate a vast region.The geographic distance between some rural communities and higher education institutions, as well as technical and vocational schools, is also a factor. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, 20 percent of non-metro residents complete their college degrees compared to 30 percent in metropolitan areas.Similarly, when it comes to providing social services in rural America, spatial challenges arise in making those services accessible and visible to a remote public. The repertoire of services available to [rural people] is smaller,  Lobao says. Her research indicates that 50 percent of metropolitan counties provide subsidies for emergency medical services, while only 30 percent of non-metro counties do. Similarly, 30 percent of metro counties make elder care available, but only 20 percent of non-metro counties do. And 25 percent of metro counties provide childcare care, but only 16 percent of non-metro countries do. Each of these deficits contributes to the higher rate of poverty that we see among the rural poor.Lisa Pruitt, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, studies the intersection of law and rural livelihoods. She also runs a site called the Legal Ruralism Blog, where she writes about the problem of rural American poverty. Pruitt grew up in a working-class rural Newton County in the Ozarks of northwest Arkansas. She tells Rural America In These Times that one important misconception about rural poverty is that it is an exclusively white problem. While the majority of rural Americans struggling with poverty are white, Pruitt says, the racial makeup of the rural poor is far more diverse than the image most Americans realize. We tend to associate rural poverty with whiteness,  Pruitt says.  When we think about rural poverty, most associations with rural poverty are with white populations and in fact, that is true to some extent but it s actually far from being monochromatic. The demographics of poverty in rural and urban America are quite similar. Though whites make up the majority of both metropolitan and non-metropolitan populations in the United States resulting in a higher numbers of whites living in poverty poverty rates throughout rural America are much higher among the rural minority population. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 40 percent of blacks living in non-metro counties fall below the poverty line, compared to 15 percent of whites. Poverty rates among non-metro Hispanics and American Indians are also considerably higher than they are among whites.This popular association between rural American poverty and whiteness is key to understanding why the media, and liberal America as a whole, doesn t talk about rural American poverty. While black poverty in the United States is attributed to the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, housing discrimination, incarceration, and other forms of institutionalized racism, we have no national narrative that explains white poverty. As a result, there is an implicit belief that whites who have benefited from all of the advantages that come with being white don t have a good reason to be poor. In other words, that when whites live in poverty, it is their fault, or even their choice.Since the 1960s, the current U.S. economic system has had as a constant feature 15 percent of the population living below the poverty line. For better or worse,  says Pruitt,  when we talk about poverty, we focus on black poverty, and we focus on Hispanic poverty. We ve collapsed our nation s poverty problem into our nation s racism problem and it leads us to turn a blind eye to rural poverty. One of Pruitt s overarching arguments is that this political polarization between the liberal mainstream and the rural poor is self-perpetuating, and will only worsen with time as the rural poor are  excluded from the pipeline to power. There is such a disconnect between the people in power in this country and the rural poor. It s a negative feedback loop,  says Pruitt.  If you re deciding who you are going to admit to Harvard and you see they grew up socio-economically disadvantaged from rural America, the knee-jerk reaction is,  We don t want those people among us. They re racist. They re uncouth. They re unsavory.   Though the left has all but cornered the subject of poverty and its myriad dimensions, the fact that rural Americans tend to espouse conservative positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights does not make the liberal media or Democratic candidates any more sympathetic to rural American poverty. And if the 2008 Presidential Election is any indicator, poor rural Americans, especially whites, feel increasingly at odds with liberal politics and liberal candidates. I think the assumption is that rural white voters are racist and illiberal and intolerant,  says Pruitt.  And so there are all sorts of incentives to distance ourselves for the Democratic presidential candidates to distances themselves from rural whites. I think that most rural white voters are pretty alienated from politics generally, and the Democratic Party in particular. Yet the left and working class rural Americans have many reasons to forge a stronger relationship specifically in challenging the authority of corporate America and growing the bargaining power of workers. Lobao, clearly frustrated, says rural sociologists have spent a lot of time thinking about how the left could appeal to rural Americans and often find themselves mired in  platitudes. The one thing that we could stress in terms of social values is the value of building community,  she said.    Do you like your community? Do you want to build it? Well why can t we?  We can try to emphasize building the community, you know, because people identify with their community whether they re Republican or Democrat.

15406,OBAMA IGNORES PLANNED PARENTHOOD BABY PARTS HARVESTER STORY…His DOJ Goes After Whistleblower Group Who Exposed Them,"Justice the Obama way Instead of investigating whether Planned Parenthood illegally trafficked baby body parts, Obama s DOJ is targeting the group behind the undercover videosThe U.S. Department of Justice announced plans to investigate the group that produced undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood employees admitting that they harvest and sell organs ripped from the bodies aborted babies. Politico reported the news of the coming DOJ investigation earlier today:JUSTICE TO PROBE CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS   While congressional committees investigate Planned Parenthood s practices, the Justice Department agreed to look into whether the group that released the sting videos obtained the footage legally. In response to a request by House Democrats, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday afternoon that Justice would  review all of the information and determine what the appropriate steps moving forward would be.  Planned Parenthood has staunchly defended its practices and claims that the Center for Medical Progress illegally obtained its footage, then excessively edited it to misrepresent what the organization does. The DOJ investigation of the Center for Medical Progress, which, unlike Planned Parenthood, is not in the business of killing healthy, viable unborn babies in order to sell their organs for cash, was announced after several Democratic lawmakers called for the organization to be targeted:Four Democrats in Congress   Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke   have written to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, asking them to open investigations into the Center for Medical Progress. The Democrats say the videos were filmed as part of an  elaborate scheme    using  fake identification  and without the approval of the Planned Parenthood doctor who appears in them. It s interesting that Lynch decided so early to make a statement about the group. There are certainly more videos to come, and if Planned Parenthood s panicked press releases are any indication, the footage may be far more damaging than anything that s been revealed thus far. However, given the abject politicization of multiple agencies under Obama s command   including the Internal Revenue Service, which targeted conservative non-profits, and the DOJ, which has been hesitant to investigate Obama allies   it seems unlikely that Lynch and those who report to her will ever crack down on Abortion, Inc.Via: The Federalist",politics,"Jul 27, 2015",justice way parenthood baby body group department justice group parenthood politico news investigation today justice center progress parenthood justice department group footage response request house attorney lynch afternoon justice information parenthood center progress footage organization investigation center progress parenthood business order cash organization reps jerry attorney lynch attorney kamala center progress part scheme identification approval parenthood doctor lynch statement group parenthood press indication footage anything command revenue service allies lynch abortion federalist

6110, The Los Angeles Times Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead Of California Primary,"As Politico reports an almost neck-and-neck race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Los Angeles Times has endorsed the former Secretary of State before the critical primary on June 7.The editorial board laid out plainly their support for Clinton, highlighting her ability to get the job done in the face of rising populism:As all the world knows, Clinton would be the first woman elected president of the United States. That would be a joyous, long-awaited, landmark moment in American history after centuries of discrimination and second-class status for half the population. But the real reason to support her is that she is the Democratic candidate most likely to get the job done.As the mainstream media is peddling a completely false narrative that Clinton s support is unexcited or unenthusiastic, the Los Angeles Times destroys that now hackneyed talking point:[C]linton s candidacy might seem unexciting. But nominating a candidate for president is, or ought to be, serious business. As Obama himself likely would admit after almost eight years in the White House, there is more to being president than grand promises, whether they are about  hope and change  or a political revolution. We admire Bernie Sanders  passion for progress and equality, but our endorsement goes to the candidate who is more likely to translate ideals into action.Sanders and Clinton have been fighting hard to win over the California electorate, which offers up just under 550 delegates. Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 97 percent chance of winning the state, but Sanders has shown to be as competitive as ever.The Times pointed out that Sanders  popular rhetoric amongst younger voters have made him a very formidable candidate who should be taken seriously, not brushed aside even heading into the convention (assuming Clinton clinches the magic number of delegates to win). Saying that he has made the race more substantive and he has drawn Clinton to he left, the board seriously doubted his ability to bring Republicans to the table.But that s not to say he couldn t.On the last day of registration, over 150,000 new citizens were admitted on the rolls, 42 percent of which were between the ages of 18 and 34, a good sign for Senator Sanders. Sanders also has outspent Clinton in critical metropolitan areas all across the state, including Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and so forth.As the primary winds down, California will be the seemingly final hurrah in a long battle between the two progressive candidates, with one victor walking away as the nominee for president come July.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",politico neck neck race sanders times secretary state primary june editorial board support ability job face world woman president landmark moment history discrimination class status population reason candidate job media narrative support times point candidacy candidate president business house president hope change revolution sanders passion progress equality endorsement candidate action sanders electorate silver percent chance state sanders times sanders rhetoric amongst candidate convention number race board ability table day registration percent sign senator sanders sanders metropolitan state hurrah battle victor nominee president image
330, Trump Insults John McCain For Refusing To Strip Healthcare From Millions Of Americans,"John McCain survived brutal torture and six years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam. If Donald Trump thinks he can intimidate him, he should think again.On Friday, the Arizona senator released a statement announcing his intention to vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill that Republicans have introduced to repeal Obamacare.The bill would strip healthcare from 30 million Americans, and turn Medicaid into a block grant program that would cease to exist after a few years. The bill also gives states the power to obtain waivers so that insurance companies can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. America s healthcare system would be thrown into dire chaos, and Trump is absolutely okay with that.McCain is not.The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won t be available by the end of the month, we won t have reliable answers to any of those questions.And for that, Trump viciously attacked McCain.John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017First off, block grants are not enough to cover all the people who desperately need healthcare. In fact, it limits funding to the point where state officials will have to decide who gets care and who doesn t to avoid using up the grant money on expensive treatments, which sounds a lot like a death panel.Second, Lindsey Graham s friendship with McCain does not mean they vote the same, as Graham made clear on Twitter.My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he s lived his life and the person he is.  Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017Obamacare has its flaws, but those flaws can be fixed easily with bipartisan legislation. McCain understands this and he understands that repealing Obamacare would leave tens of millions of Americans without healthcare, including millions of conservatives in red states.Donald Trump is an asshole. He wants to kill a major healthcare law just because it is known as Obamacare and because he is desperate for major legislation to sign. He hasn t even actually read the damn bill, which medical organizations and the healthcare industry agree is terrible.Besides, if Trump wanted McCain s vote so much he should have thought of that before criticizing him for being a POW.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2017",torture prisoner war trump senator statement intention graham bill bill turn block grant program bill power insurance people system chaos trump issue risk people election health insurance bill impact approach faith prospect attempt bill impression work attempt solution fail cannot conscience vote graham proposal support effect insurance people score end month trump intention bill governor trump increase year chuck bill goods block thing management friend trump block people fact point state care grant money lot death panel graham friendship graham twitter friendship respect life person legislation millions millions trump law legislation damn bill industry agree trump vote pow image
5193, Ben Carson Managed To Say Something SO Stupid That Trump Looks Like A Genius By Comparison (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is an idiot. Ben Carson, a literal brain surgeon, is so stupid that the phrase  what are you, a brain surgeon or something?  loses all meaning. Carson, who was fired from Trump s campaign after leaking Sarah Palin as one of the clowns on Trump s VP shortlist and who was illegally promised a position on Trump s campaign in exchange for his support, said something on Wednesday that almost, almost makes Donald Trump s recent string of dumber-than-normal statements and stunts not seem all that bad at all by comparison   you know, if Carson s dumbass remarks weren t an attempt to defend Trump s dumbass remarks.With pretty much the entire universe condemning Trump s disgusting attacks on the family of a Muslim veteran, the Trump camp is working triple-overtime to defend his actions rather than acknowledge that he s a horrible human being. Trump s supporters have suggested that the father of the deceased hero thinks Sharia Law is above the Constitution (he doesn t), that he is a Muslim Brotherhood  agent  (once again, this is an unfounded claim), and any other number of ridiculous things they can come up with. The Right is even blaming Cpt. Humayun Khan s death on President Obama even though he died years before Obama took office. Trump himself has attacked the grief-stricken mother, because he s an asshole.But what can be worse than someone who dedicates his life to attacking the parents of a fallen soldier? How about demanding that they apologize to Trump? That s exactly what Ben Carson did when Wolf Blitzer asked him about the Trump-Khan situation. We have important issues to deal with. Let s just call a truce,  Carson told Blitzer, adding that Trump and the Khans should just  move on.  Asked if Trump should apologize to the Khans, Mr. Brain Guy explained that they should be apologizing to Trump for who knows why?: I don t think it would be harmful if they apologized to him and he apologized to them, but I don t see that happening. Well, of course it s not going to happen. They did nothing wrong besides stand inside The Donald s cross-hairs. Asked why they   the family of a dead soldier whom Trump attacked   should apologize to them, Carson upped the derp a bit: Well, for one thing, if you accuse someone of something that s not true, it usually is a reasonable thing to acknowledge that. He s right. If someone lies about someone else, they should apologize. But that s not what happened here. They have not lied about him at all. In fact, they even offered to loan him a copy of their pocket Constitution since Trump is running for President and apparently has never read it. It s unclear what Carson means by  not true,  but it s sort of hilarious that he doesn t think that statement applies to Trump.Watch Carson insert his foot in his mouth below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=91&v=bJZyBny5my4Featured image via screengrab",News,"August 3, 2016",trump ben brain surgeon phrase brain surgeon something trump campaign trump position trump campaign exchange support something trump string comparison attempt trump universe trump family veteran trump camp overtime father hero law constitution brotherhood agent claim number right khan death president office trump grief someone life wolf trump khan situation let truce trump trump brain guy course nothing stand cross family soldier trump bit thing someone something thing someone someone fact loan copy pocket constitution trump president sort statement watch foot mouth watch image

20303,OBAMA’S WAR ON AMERICA UPDATE: FBI ISSUES RIOT ALERT For Louisiana…New Black Panthers Coming To Baton Rouge,"We reported earlier about Dallas cop killer, Micah X. Johnson and his affiliation with the New Black Panther group, as well as Obama s past history with them. These acts leading up the GOP convention are no accident. We are living in dangerous times, and the most evil man to ever occupy our White House has been working in conjunction with BLM leaders to make sure this divisive movement succeeds The FBI issued an alert to Louisiana law enforcement agencies warning of violence against officers and planned riots in the aftermath of this week s high-profile fatal shooting of a black man by Baton Rouge Police. Judicial Watch obtained a copy of the situational information report, which was distributed to police and sheriff departments in Bossier, Caddo Parish and east Baton Rouge as well as Louisiana State Police.Titled  Violence Against Law Enforcement Officers and Riots Planned for 8-10 July 2016,  the alert warns that  multiple groups are calling for or planning riots and/or violence against law enforcement in Baton Rouge and Shreveport, Louisiana beginning Friday July 8 2016 and continuing through at least July 10, 2016. The document is labeled  FOUO  (For Official Use Only), a term the government uses to mark sensitive information that s not classified. It was issued by the New Orleans division of the FBI. The agency did not respond to multiple calls from Judicial Watch for comment.A spokesman for the Louisiana State Police Department, Lieutenant JB Slaton, referred Judicial Watch to the FBI and would not confirm or deny that his agency received it even though it appears on the list of recipients.  That s an FBI bulletin, they would need to address it,  Slaton told Judicial Watch after being provided with a copy of the FBI alert. When asked if his agency got the FBI alert Slaton continued to be evasive, responding that  it s an FBI bulletin. The alert is dated July 7 and includes disturbing images from social media, including one depicting a restrained uniformed police officer getting his throat slashed by a masked individual. Other social media images call for purging and killing all cops in Baton Rouge on July 9 and starting a riot by the courthouse in Shreveport that will tear shi_ _ down without killing our own black people.  Calling for unity in the violent protests, one social media post says  it don t matter what color you are.  Another says  must kill every police!!!!   Judicial WatchMeanwhile The  New Black Panther Party,  a militant racial group, announced that they will be arriving in Baton Rouge to protest outside of the Baton Rouge Police Department after Alton Sterling was shot during an altercation with a local officer, calling the headquarters the  pig department.

I just don t think these ghouls realize that no matter what they do, this is evil and wrong Planned Parenthood claims on several of its websites that the organization s web operations have been attacked by  extremists,  but this so-called hacking has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated public relations stunt.Numerous people on Twitter pointed to evidence suggesting that this so-called hack wasn t a hack at all:A review of the source code of the main page that appears at PlannedParenthood.org shows that as of 9:30 a.m. today, the page is listed as a  Campaign  and uses a specific template named  Site Down Tempalte  (the typo is theirs). The same page then directs visitors to the Facebook page of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political fundraising arm of the nation s largest abortion provider.And that s where Planned Parenthood s hacking facade begins to crumble. On the splash page declaring that the organization was hacked, visitors are asked  Why do you stand with Planned Parenthood  and invited to share their stories on a separate page.And wouldn t you know it, that page functions perfectly.What next Planned Parenthood, you gonna stage a fake bombing or arson at one of your abortion clinics as a fundraising hoax? I m sure your pals at the SPLC could supply a list of likely suspects to frame.It s just a shame these ghouls can t cry racism or homophobia.

9640,BLM PROTESTER Leaves Angry After Watching FERGUSON- The Play in NYC…Realizes She Was LIED To By Media: “Why did I demonstrate ‘Hands in the air…Don’t shoot’?” [VIDEO] ,"Filmmaker and author Phelim McAleer knew he was going to ruffle some feathers when he decided to open his FERGUSON-the play in the leftist hotbed of New York City. McAleer has never been one to shy away from controversy, especially when he knows the truth is on his side. So last night, with very little mainstream media coverage, Phelim opened his controversial play in NYC, that challenges the false narrative being fed to the general public about what really happened in Ferguson, MO. The Ferguson play will, no doubt, force viewers to question how much of what the media feeds them is real, and how much is propaganda that feeds their leftist agenda.  What is FERGUSON?FERGUSON is a staged reenactment of the controversial killing of Michael Brown using ONLY Grand Jury testimony. No spin. No media filter. Just the truth. Nine cast members of the staged reading in Los Angeles walked out before opening night because of their desire to rewrite the script. But you can t rewrite the truth; you can t rewrite history. See for yourself!LA Weekly called the staged reading of FERGUSON  a riveting spectacle  and  an incendiary evening of theatre.  This is the World Premiere of a full production.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot, Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.As guests at the opening of the thought-provoking Ferguson-the play began to exit the theater, Phelim approached a random woman to get her reaction to the performance. The woman he questioned seemed confused and angry by what she just witnessed. She admits she was a Black Lives Matter supporter, and even protested with Black Lives Matter to help them to push the  hands up, don t shoot  narrative. After realizing that she had been lied to by the media, she asks Phelim,  Why did I demonstrate  Hands in the air Don t shoot ? The controversial play opened last night in New York City and is set to run through November 5th.Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production.

5661, NBA Politely Tells North Carolina To F*ck Right Off Over The ‘Fix’ For Their Bathroom Law,"North Carolina is in a world of trouble. Their bathroom law, which tells transgender people that they must use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate, has led to businesses fleeing or avoiding the state so they don t sully their own brands. That includes the NBA and the 2017 All-Star Game, which forced the state s legislature to come up with a  fix  so they could keep the All-Star game.The All-Star Game was supposed to be in Charlotte next year. Charlotte wants to be friendly, compassionate and inclusive, and they re upset with the state legislature overriding the law they put in place that allowed transgender people to use the bathroom that went with their gender identity without making them feel like they have to produce documentation just to take a piss. The NBA feels the same way, and issued the following statement on the matter:.@NBA and the Charlotte Hornets come out swinging against #HB2, saying they re not pleased with the amended version: pic.twitter.com/OHNwAJbhCg  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 30, 2016 We have been engaged in dialogue with numerous groups at the city and state levels, but we do not endorse the version of the bill that we understand is currently before the legislature. We remain committed to our guiding principles of inclusion, mutual respect and equal protections for all. We continue to believe that constructive engagement with all sides is the right path forward. There has been no new decision made regarding the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. Well, isn t that a nice way of saying,  You re still a bunch of bigots, now kindly go fuck yourselves. The  fix  is actually no fix at all, and it does reveal North Carolina s GOP as the stodgy bigots they are. It actually makes things worse. Transgender people have to obtain a  certificate of sex reassignment  in order to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Imagine all the hoops they ll have to jump through just to get that certificate. Then there are all the transgender people who haven t yet had, or aren t able to (for whatever reason) have reassignment surgery. This fix doesn t include them at all.The GOP thinks they re playing both sides though   anything to be able to continue policing people s genitals and dictating where they can pee while ignoring real problems and avoiding real work.The problem is that these hidebound Neanderthals in Republican legislatures want to eat their cake and have it, too. They re either discriminating or they re not   there s no two ways about it. North Carolina wants to appease the LGBT community and all their allies while still being able to push them down.

But the frequency of them is something that would just play out as time went on,  he added.On this week s  Powerhouse Politics  podcast, Fallon promised greater interaction between Clinton and the press on the campaign trail and said he expects the Democratic nominee to hold a press conference soon. The amount of interaction can only go up,  he said, noting that the traveling press will soon be flying with Clinton on her new campaign plane. I m sure that will bring with it a lot of opportunities for additional access to the candidate and interactions between her and the traveling press corps that covers her every day,  Fallon told ABC News  chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, and political director Rick Klein on the podcast. We are very respectful of the press and the job that they have to do,  Fallon continued.  We have done a lot of interviews, but I know that no matter how many questions we answer in a variety of formats, it is the press s job to always demand more access.

17322,WHY IS OBAMA DISARMING COPS IN AMERICA At Same Time Terror Threat Is Being Raised?,"In the face of mounting threats of terrorism and civil unrest in U.S. cities, President Barack Obama is arbitrarily prohibiting local police and sheriff departments from obtaining military surplus equipment from the Defense Department as part of what many law enforcement officers are calling his war on police.Beginning on Monday, Obama visited a number of high-crime areas   especially those with large black populations   to explain the need for his unilateral action, according to news sources on Monday.President Obama s spokespeople said Monday that the administration will no longer give local cops some types of protective gear and vehicles while putting stricter controls on other weapons and equipment distributed to law enforcement. The details were released prior to Obama s visit to Camden, News Jersey, Monday afternoon to give a speech on how he will address police officers allegedly using racist tactics based on racist departmental policies.Obama and his supporters view police wearing protective riot gear and using armored vehicles as being overly-aggressive in neighborhoods that are predominately black and Hispanic. The President even accused some departments of issuing bayonets, which is demonstrably untrue, according to one police officer who claims she voted for Obama in 2008.  This President actually shows his dislike for local cops. I believe he wants to federalize policing and do away with local and state law enforcement. While the constitution prohibits that, when was the last time Obama cared about what the constitution says,  said Iris Aquino, a former police detective.During Obama s speech in Camden, New Jersey, a city reputed to have the highest violent crime rate in the United States, not once did he mention the police officers who were gunned down by blacks or whites within the last few months, noted a New York City police official who has been active fighting against the anti-cop Mayor Bill de Blasio.  That s because Obama like many liberal-left ideologues believe that police officers are the primary oppressors of minorities. The fact that Obama and the  racial-division industry    which includes the likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson   keep blacks in a state of poverty in order to use their anger and resentment for their own political interests appears to escape the notice of the news media, another group that doesn t care about dead cops,  he said.Originally police officers were led to believe that Obama would continue the Pentagon s military surplus program, however a panel of his sycophants warned that there is a propensity for misuse of equipment such as armored vehicles, high-powered firearms and camouflage. But not one example of police misusing an armored vehicle has been reported.  I have not heard of one incident in which police misused an armored vehicle. These are defensive vehicles used by cops to protect themselves from gunfire, Molotov cocktails, explosives and weapons of mass destruction,  said former law enforcement commander Jack McGowan.  High-powered firearms? The police use nothing that even resembles a  powerful  firearm. And camo clothing is clothing. No one gets hurt from a shirt s design pattern,  McGowan said.Besides cutting off the flow of equipment that would have gone to local law enforcement, the Obama government considering a recall of certain equipment that was already give to local police and sheriffs departments.  I ll highlight steps all cities can take to maintain trust between the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line, and the communities they re sworn to serve and protect,  Obama said in his weekly address out Saturday.Obama believes law enforcement is a necessary evil, claim his opponents.  He s never showed local cops any respect. He also doesn t trust any agency he doesn t directly control. This is an American leader who wants to federalize the law enforcement function and he has a lot supporters who trust big government over states rights,  political strategist Michael Baker.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani s Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he believes a  war on police,  exists in America, the anti-cop attitudes are being stoked up by Obama and his minions.  After 20 years of incredible crime reduction accomplished by thousands of dedicated police officers, the public has become complacent now that they are safer,  said Safir.  They have let the anti-police pundits and talking heads convince everyone from the president to the attorney general that police are racist and brutal.

12223,BREAKING: OBAMA-APPOINTED JUDGE ORDERS Vote Recount To Begin At Noon On Monday,"A federal judge has ordered Michigan election officials to begin a massive hand recount of 4.8 million ballots cast in the presidential election at noon Monday.U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith issued a ruling just after midnight Monday in favor of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who sought to let election officials bypass a two-business-day waiting period that would have delayed start of the recount until Wednesday morning.The manual recount process was scheduled to begin Wednesday as specified by state law, and in a rare Sunday hearing in federal court, Goldsmith questioned the harm posed by waiting.Stein s lawyer Mark Brewer argued the case was aimed at ensuring the integrity of Michigan s voting system and that the required waiting period violated Stein s rights to due process and equal protection. He pushed for the recount of 4.8 million ballots to start immediately, which he said would be Monday morning. There are questions raised throughout the country about the integrity of the election system,  Brewer told the judge in front of a courtroom filled with about two dozen people, including state Republican Party Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel.  It s not just rhetoric. The hearing ended Sunday afternoon, with a staffer for the judge saying Goldsmith would issue a written opinion but he did not give a timeline.The deadline to finalize the vote total for the Electoral College is Dec. 13. Chris Thomas, the state elections director, testified Sunday that he could not guarantee that the recount could be finished by that deadline, calling the task  doable but difficult.  Brewer called it  highly doubtful  that the state could finish by the deadline, and asserted the recount needed to start immediately.Read more: Detroit News",politics,"Dec 5, 2016",judge election hand recount election noon district judge mark goldsmith ruling midnight favor party candidate stein election business day period start recount morning recount process state law hearing court goldsmith harm lawyer mark brewer case integrity voting system waiting period process protection recount morning country integrity election system brewer judge front courtroom dozen people state party chair hearing afternoon staffer judge goldsmith opinion deadline vote total college state director recount deadline task brewer state deadline recount news
15822,BREAKING: VIDEO OF YOUNG OBAMA EMERGES Discussing Mentor Frank Marshall Davis’ Advice About Growing Up In A White Racist World,"Who needs family when you have a neighborhood mentor who can teach you the value of racism, communism and hate for America?In his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama never discussed the identity of the mysterious  Frank  who had given him important advice on growing up black in what was described as a white racist world. We learned in 2008 that  Frank  was Frank Marshall Davis, a member of the Communist Party who was the subject of a 600-page FBI file. Still, the major media never asked Obama about this important relationship during his growing up years in Hawaii.Now, in an extraordinary development, video of Obama explicitly and openly identifying  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis has suddenly surfaced on the Internet. The footage is said to have been recorded on September 20, 1995, with the program originally airing on Channel 37 Cambridge Municipal Television as an episode of the show,  The Author Series. It s not clear how many saw this program when it aired. For some reason, this  From the Vault  Barack Obama presentation was just recently posted on YouTube. In the video, Obama is introduced as a Harvard Law School student and President of the Harvard Law Review. He discusses  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis at about 8:37 in the video.In his remarks, Obama never identifies Davis as a communist or even a leftist. But the remarks do reflect the significant influence that Davis had over his young life as he was growing up in Hawaii. Obama talks about how Davis  schools  him on the subject of race relations. The term implies a teacher-student relationship the two of them had, confirming what we had reported back in 2008, that Davis had functioned as Obama s  mentor. It s important to understand what Obama is saying here. Getting ready to read directly from his book, Dreams from My Father, Obama talks about the passages ending with  me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather, a close friend of gramps, a black man from Kansas, named Frank, actually at the time a fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis, who had moved to Hawaii and lived there, and so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations I m having, and he sorts of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations Davis was indeed a black poet. His works included attacks on Christianity. One Davis poem referred to Christ irreverently as a  nigger.  Davis was himself an atheist.However, Davis was better known as a communist propagandist whose work for the Communist Party in Hawaii earned him surveillance by the FBI and placement on its  security index.  Davis was also a pornographer who engaged in bizarre sexual practices, even pedophilia.Needless to say, Obama s willingness to identify  Frank  as Davis before this audience raises questions as to why  Frank  wasn t identified by his full name Frank Marshall Davis in the book itself. Obama made references to  Frank  22 times throughout his book. Paul Kengor notes that Obama s audio version of Dreams from My Father omitted every reference to  Frank  that was in the book. Those omissions were clearly designed to keep people from asking questions about  Frank,  since Obama was considering a run for the presidency.Today, in 2015, discovering film of Obama identifying  Frank  as Davis is confirmation of the obvious. It doesn t make a lot of difference politically, since Obama is serving out his second term. But it could have made a difference seven years ago, in 2008, when we identified  Frank  as Davis, during Obama s campaign for his first term in office.The clip of Obama talking about Davis during his 1995 Cambridge presentation is important for other reasons, however.By his own admission, Obama was preoccupied with his own feelings and thoughts about race relations. He saw himself as an  angry young man  whose father was absent from his life. He said he was  without father figures around who might guide and steer my anger. That s significant because it s clear, from the passages he reads, that Davis became that father figure. Davis was indeed picked by his white grandfather to be a role model or father figure for the young Barack Obama.In the passages he read back in 1995, Obama discussed inviting some white friends to a black party and seeing them squirm.  They re trying to tap their foot to the beat and being extraordinarily friendly,  he said. They are trying to fit in but they are uncomfortable and they tell Obama they want to leave. Obama concluded,  What I have had to put up with every day of my life is something that they find so objectionable that they can t even put up with a day. This is like a revelation to Obama about the world of white racism. All of this he says  triggers  something in his head and he comprehends a  new map of the world.  He gets a sense of the anger and betrayal in society and even in his own family, where he is being raised by his white grandfather,  Gramps,  and white grandmother,  Toot.  This leads him to seek advice from  Frank.  Frank Marshall Davis then  sort of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations,  Obama says.The passages that he reads from the book before the Cambridge audience include a discussion of when his own white grandmother was accosted by a black panhandler. Davis told Obama that his grandmother was right to be scared and that  She understands that black people have reason to hate. In other words, Davis did not encourage Obama to pursue racial harmony or reconciliation. He told Obama that blacks have a reason, or right, to hate.Via:AIM.comh/t Weasel Zippers",politics,"Apr 14, 2015",family neighborhood mentor value racism communism hate book father identity frank advice racist world frank member communist party subject page file media relationship development video frank footage program channel television episode show author series program reason vault presentation video law school student president law review frank video communist influence life subject race term student relationship mentor book father conversation friend grandfather friend man time poet discussion poet works poem nigger atheist propagandist work communist party surveillance placement security index pornographer willingness frank audience name book times book version father reference book people run presidency today film frank confirmation lot difference term difference campaign term office clip presentation admission race man father life father anger father figure grandfather role model figure party foot beat day life something day revelation world racism something head map world sense anger betrayal society family grandfather grandmother toot advice sort book audience discussion grandmother panhandler grandmother people reason harmony reconciliation reason right aim weasel
20413,EMBARRASSING: Pro-Gun Control Reporter Attempts Hit Job On AR-15’s…Claims He Got “Temporary PTSD”…Viewers Respond: “If you have a man card turn it in immediately” [VIDEO],"What is it about liberal men that makes a woman want to shoot him up with testosterone just to make him tolerable?  Gersh Kuntzman of the New York Daily News has been roundly mocked since the publishing of an article headlined  What is it like to fire an AR-15? It s horrifying, menacing and very very loud. The article also contains a video of Kuntzman shooting the AR-15, a segment put together one day after the Orlando massacre.He described the experience as an  explosion of firepower  that was  humbling and deafening,  but it was a line at the end of the article that people really took issue with. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick,  he said.  The explosions   loud like a bomb   gave me a temporary case of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable. It was the  temporary case of PTSD  that critics found inappropriate and Kuntzman added a note about it after publishing, while linking to a follow-up story showcasing some of the responses he received.Many people have objected to my use of the term  PTSD  in the above story. The use of this term was in no way meant to conflate my very temporary anxiety with the very real condition experienced by many of our brave men and women in uniform. I regret the inarticulate use of the term to describe my in-the-moment impression of the gun s firepower, and apologize for it. I have also posted a follow up piece here.In the follow-up mentioned, which Kuntzman headlined  To gun lovers, you can t even have an opinion on assault rifles   unless it s theirs. Here s the proof,  the writer opened by saying  The gun debate is also a gender war. In all my years in journalism   coming up on 30 (thanks)   I have never received so much angry mail as I did after yesterday s story. Here is a sampling of the  angry mail  he received: Kuntzman is an outright liar. Nice try with an extremely stupid article which only appealed to girly boys and women of NYC and like the sheeple they are probably believed the lies. Hey there Cupcake! I have never subscribed to the idea of  gender confusion,  but after reading your article on the AR-15, I m a believer because there is no way you and I are the same gender. You should surrender your testicles to the Department of Girlymen. I m not sure where it s located, but your girlfriend Barack does! You f king pussy. If you have a man card turn it in immediately. You might be better served writing about feminine hygiene products!!! Maybe you can get some balls through Obamacare!

21516,IS HILLARY GOING DOWN IN FLAMES? Latest Poll Shows Her Losing Big Time Credibility With Her Most Important Voters,"The good news is the Clinton Crime Syndicate is finally starting to come apart at the seams. The bad news is socialist Bernie Sanders is gaining steam, Joe (the clown) Biden and  Fauxcahantas  (Elizabeth Warren) are patiently waiting in the wings Hillary Clinton s popularity is plunging among white women, a slice of Americans she desperately needs to win over if she is to become president.A poll released Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that just 34 per cent of Caucasian females have a positive view of the former secretary of state. That figure has dropped 10 points in the last month.Her  unfavorable  number among the same group climbed by ten points. Now 53 per cent of white women in the U.S. simply don t like her. Even in America s suburbs, Clinton is  under water  by five points, with more of those voters seeing her negatively than positively.A similar dynamic is dogging her among college-educated white women, just 43 per cent of whom have a positive view of Clinton   compared to 47 per cent who view her unfavorably. A month ago she was in positive territory with that group, by a 51-38 margin.Barack Obama won the White House on the strength of a massive groundswell of black voters   something that won t likely repeat itself in 2016.Clinton still posts strong numbers among blacks, but those statistics, too, are slipping.Sixty-six per cent of them told pollsters that they view her favorably, compared with 15 per cent who disagreed. But a month ago the same question brought an 81-3 runaway love-fest.Black voters overwhelmingly choose Democratic candidates, but large numbers of them might not be motivated to vote at all if the party doesn t field a nominee whom they find appealing. Clinton s case for claiming the Oval Office is being hurt by growing scandals related to Clinton s private email server, her role in burying bad news about the Benghazi terror attack just weeks before the last presidential election, and foreign donations to her family foundation.Many Democrats have long hoped Hillary Clinton might expand Barack Obama s electoral coalition by drawing in more white women voters. There is no way you can say she s in the same position this month compared to last month,  said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who co-directs the WSJ/NBC News survey.  She s been dented and she s in a weaker position. The poll sampled opinions from 1,000 adults last week. It also found that self-described  independent  voters, those with no party affiliation who make up the crucial and uncommitted middle of the electorate, are solidly against Clinton on the favorable/unfavorable question, by a 27-52 margin.Even with her baggage and dwindling support among a few key demographic groups, Clinton remains the Democratic Party s odds-on favorite to be its presidential nominee.Her closest competitor, self-described  socialist  senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, trails her by a 59-25 margin when Democrats. But that number might also be soft: In June her 34-point spread over the raw-emotion populist Sanders was 60.Via: Daily Mail",left-news,"Aug 4, 2015",news crime syndicate news sanders steam joe warren popularity slice president poll street journal news cent view secretary state figure month number group cent water dynamic college cent view cent month territory group margin house strength something repeat statistics cent cent month question love party field case office server role news terror attack election family foundation coalition way position month month bill pollster news survey position poll week self party affiliation middle electorate question margin baggage support party odds favorite nominee competitor self senator sanders margin number june point spread emotion sanders mail

This portion of her speech seems to emphasize her role in getting the naming done. That was his point, she needs the spotlight hence her using the death of a soldier and the families grief as a political football trying to score political points.In case you missed the wonderful message from Chief of Staff Kelly:White House Chief of Staff John Kelly says he was stunned to learn that Congresswoman Frederica Wilson listened in on the president s call to a fallen soldier s wife. He came into the White House press briefing and let the press have it too. He goes through the steps of what happens when someone in the military is killed. He says that the members of our military are the best 1% of our population. He said he was  brokenhearted  when he found out what a member of congress did. This is a heartfelt moment that is amazing:KELLY DOES A GREAT JOB OF CUTTING THROUGH THE BS FROM THE PRESS:The retired general who lost his own son in Afghanistan said the call to Sgt. La David T. Johnson s wife should have been  sacred. It stuns me that a member of congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. I thought at least that was sacred,  he said.The White House official found himself at the center of a charge that President Barack Obama  didn t make calls  to the families of fallen soldiers this week after President Trump claimed that Obama didn t call Kelly when his son Robert died.Kelly said Thursday at a White House news conference that it s true   but he wasn t offended.In fact, Kelly says he counseled Trump not to call Gold Star families and to instead write letters.Read more: Daily Mail",left-news,"Oct 20, 2017",gen portion speech role point spotlight hence death soldier grief football case message chief staff house chief staff congresswoman president call wife house press briefing press someone military population member congress moment job press general son call la wife member congress conversation house official center charge president week president trump call son house news conference fact trump gold star mail
4992, Anti-Trump Group Has Placed DETAILED Statues Of Him In 5 U.S. Cities (VIDEO),"Statues of Donald Trump have appeared in five cities across the country, and it s clear that they re not meant to honor him. They re almost caricatures, and they portray him stark naked in a rather ahem insulting way. The intent is essentially to unmask Trump, and portray him as the disgusting little prick he is.The statues were placed in L.A., San Francisco, Seattle, Cleveland and New York City. The one in New York City was quickly removed, but ABC 7 Chicago reports that the West Coast statues still stand. An activist group known as INDECLINE, which speaks out against Trump, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the works of art. They said their hope is that Trump  is never installed in the most powerful political and military position in the world. They also said: It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America s most infamous and reviled politicians. On their website, INDECLINE calls this particular protest  The Emperor Has No Balls,  and they ve made it very clear on the statues that they see Trump as the ball-less wonder of the GOP. A three-minute video on their website shows exactly how they made the statues, complete with sound bytes of some of the worst things Trump has said in his speeches. You can watch the video below, if you can bear it (warning: Explicit imagery, very NSFW):The Trump campaign didn t comment on the statues, but that may change at some point.

18857,PARIS NIGHTMARE: MUSLIM MAN Scales Wall Of Apartment…Stabs Jewish Woman…What He Does Next Is Unthinkable! [VIDEO],"An elderly Jewish woman living in Paris was not even safe in her own apartment from a Muslim man who scaled the wall of her apartment and violently murdered her. While the authorities have not yet named the motive, it s highly likely the Muslim man who killed the Orthodox Jewish woman while yelling,  Alluha Akbar  may have been motivated to commit such a hateful crime by the  religion of peace In a violent attack causing trepidation amongst Paris  Jewish community, a 66-year-old Orthodox woman, Sarah Halimi, was murdered to the cry of  Allahu Akbar  early Tuesday morning, pushed from the window of her top-floor apartment in Paris  11th arrondissement.The accused, a 27-year-old of Muslim origin known to police for a string of offenses, had broken into the apartment of his victim   reportedly scaling the exterior wall from the floor below where he lived with his parents   to stab his victim before throwing her to her death.The lifeless body of Ms. Halimi was found on the ground beneath her apartment, having been pushed to her death from her third story window during the attack which took place at approximately 4:30am.Three armed police were on the scene prior to the murder, according to neighbors, who also reported hearing the cry of  Allahu Akbar  at the moment of the crime. Unconfirmed reports circulating on social media also suggest that Ms. Halimi had previously been harassed by a relative of the accused, and that she had been subjected to verbal abuse in the days leading up to the incident. Neighbors claim that the accused had been  radicalized  and that police were waiting for an anti-terrorist unit to deal with the situation.French media have been covering the event with limited reference to the background of either the victim or the accused, instead characterizing the crime as the act of an unhinged individual. Further details of the incident have been emerging in the local Jewish media, with the story now gaining traction in Israel.Whilst the motives behind this crime are not yet 100% clear, it represents a growing phenomenon of criminal acts being preceded by cries of  Allahu Akbar  ( Our God is Greater ) consistently explained by French media as the acts of  d s quilibr s , the  unbalanced    a word fast entering the lexicon for such circumstances.

1534, ‘Turn The Lights Off!’: Spicer Literally Hid In the Bushes From Reporters After Trump Fired Comey,"Brave White House press secretary Sean Spicer had an odd appropriate reaction after his boss abruptly fired the man who was leading an investigation into his administration s ties to Russia. Spicer had just finished a brief interview with Fox Business from the White House grounds late Tuesday night then he took cover in the bushes to avoid questions, according to The Washington Post. Spicer huddled with his staff behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why Trump abruptly fired FBI director James Comey.The White House press secretary had to get back to his office somehow but to do that he needed to pass a swarm of reporters.Spicer and his staff turned themselves into pretzels for hours in an attempt to defend Trump s bizarre decision to fire Comey.The Washington Post reports:Spicer had wanted to drop the bombshell news in an emailed statement, but it was not transmitting quickly enough, so he ended up standing in the doorway of the press office around 5:40 p.m. and shouting a statement to reporters who happened to be nearby. He then vanished, with his staff locking the door leading to his office. The press staff said that Spicer might do a briefing, then announced that he definitely wouldn t say anything more that night. But as Democrats and Republicans began to criticize and question the firing with increasing levels of alarm, Spicer and two prominent spokeswomen were suddenly speed-walking up the White House drive to defend the president on CNN, Fox News and Fox Business.Between appearances, Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the bushes, as one does when their boss is totally not guilty. Janet Montesi, an executive assistant in the press office, emerged from the bushes (and this does not look suspicious at all) and told reporters that Spicer would answer some questions, as long as they did not film him. That s when Spicer came out of his safe place to face questions from reporters. Just turn the lights off. Turn the lights off,  Spicer demanded.  We ll take care of this.   Can you just turn that light off? Spicer s wish was granted and he found himself standing in near darkness between two tall hedges, with more than a dozen reporters closely gathered around him. For 10 minutes, he responded to a flurry of questions.Spicer had to answer questions as he stammered and hemmed and hawed. Spicer was asked when Trump and Comey spoke? last.  Uh, I don t know.

6693," Watch Chris Christie Awkwardly Dance At Springsteen Show, Ignoring That The Singer Hates Him","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie loves Bruce Springsteen. The feeling is not mutual.Christie took time out of shilling for Donald Trump to attend a recent Springsteen concert in Brooklyn and while he appeared to have a great time playing air drums over the hits, you could cut the tension with a knife.

It s gotten so bad in the last few years, that Christie did the  ultimate betrayal    he said his new favorite singer was Bon Jovi.Despite the stab in the back, Christie was seen rocking out in Brooklyn   and it was awkward.

The legendary New Jersey singer has reportedly banned Christie from using his songs at his campaign events (a claim Christie vehemently denies, yet adheres to) and has penned an op-ed slamming Christie s devastating budget cuts. The cuts are eating away at the lower edges of the middle class, not just those already classified as in poverty, and are likely to continue to get worse over the next few years. A few years later, Springsteen would join Jimmy Fallon in mocking Christie for  Bridgegate. Christie s latest political antics aren t doing him any favors either. Endorsing Trump, widely seen as a cynical move meant to land him a job in a future Trump administration, and while Springsteen has stayed mostly out of politics in this election so far, there is certainly no love lost between Donald Trump and Bruce Springsteen.

17914,WOW! TOP SPONSORS OF NFL Issue Statements About National Anthem Protests,"Despite massive boycott threats by consumers, at least 3 major sponsors of the NFL have come out in support of players disrespecting our flag and our veterans. NFL players have joined the now unemployed 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick to take a knee on the field during our national anthem as a way to show support for the Black Lives Matter anti-cop movement. The protest exploded over the weekend when President Trump spoke out against the disrespect NFL players are showing for our flag, turning the protest into an anti-Trump protest for players who many believe are still angry that Trump won the election, defeating the seriously flawed Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.Ford Motor Co., Armour Inc., and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA issued statements that affirmed NFL players  rights to kneel during the pre-game national anthem, while also sounding patriotic notes and affirming their support for the flag.Ford Motor Co, one of the biggest sponsors of the NFL just revealed that they are supporting the national anthem protests. We respect individuals  rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share,  Ford stated.  That s part of what makes America great. Ford Motor Co chairman Martha Firestone Ford took her support for the players anti-cop, Black Lives Matter and anti-President Trump protests one step further when she joined her players on the field and linked arms with her daughters. The tangled responses are the latest version of the challenges faced by corporations in a world in which the president makes public demands and denouncements of companies via Twitter.

3977, JUST IN: Republicans In Florida Are Giving One Presidential Candidate A Pretty Big Lead Already (VIDEO),"What many people have been predicting throughout the course of this election may be starting to come to fruition, but it s still early, so nothing is for certain.What s that prediction? That Republicans help Hillary Clinton win by voting for her over Donald Trump.According to TargetSmart, who is known for their political data, Clinton has an eight point lead in Florida among early voters.BREAKING: @_TargetSmart/@williamandmary FL poll: HRC 48   DJT 40Early voters from FL SoS: 55   38Likely voters, haven't voted yet: 42   43  TargetSmart (@_TargetSmart) November 2, 2016Tom Bonier, TargetSmart CEO, appeared on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell on MSNBC to share the news of this polling. The most surprising finding being that Clinton has 28% of registered Republican voters voting for her.Bonier said: We see this race as an eight point spread in favor of Secretary Clinton. 48-40. Which really is challenging the conventional wisdom of what we ve seen so far. I will say, in what we re seeing, as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network, a lot of the vote in Florida has already been cast and elsewhere. As of this morning, over 3.6 million votes have been cast, and so, what s unique about this survey is our ability to actually poll people who have voted and see where they are. There s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party, but really no sense given of how they re voting.Really what s fueling, honestly, this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for Secretary Clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered Republican voters. So, what we re seeing in this survey is winning 28% of registered Republicans who have already cast a ballot in Florida. This certainly doesn t look too good for Trump, but it s still early and the election is still a week a way, so who s really to know. BUT it s definitely looking good for Clinton thus far.

7974, Trump BASHES Obama With Hostile Fiction For Not Attending Scalia’s Funeral (TWEET),"There are a lot of things citizens of the United States can and do look for in a Commander-in-Chief. However, it s doubtful that  schoolyard bully  is part of the ideal criteria for president. There s really no better way to describe Donald Trump. He s nasty, vile, bigoted, hate-filled, and outright nauseating. The things that he says aren t okay to say in any arena of professional life, and they only reason he s allowed to get away with it is because of money, power and privilege. If the words he uses were to come out of a poor person living on the street, you d think they were unstable, phone the police and they would likely get carted away for a lifetime in an asylum.For years, Trump has tried to perpetuate the myth that President Obama not only isn t a natural-born citizen, but that he s also Muslim. And while there s absolutely nothing wrong with being Muslim, hearing it from a man who equates Islam solely to terrorism means he s calling our Commander-in-Chief a terrorist.Continuing this hostile fallacy, Trump took to Twitter to try to be witty, and posed the question: I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016First of all, President Obama DID go to the Supreme Court building alongside his wife to pay his respects while Justice Scalia lay in repose on Friday, and Vice President Biden will be attending the funeral service. However, this wasn t at all a jab at the fact that Obama wasn t unable to attend the service. It was a direct attack on President Obama to once again perpetuate the myth that our president is Muslim, which in Trump s language means, he s a terrorist. It s not even coded language. It s clear as day as he lays down his hatred for Muslims nearly every day.This man has a VERY real chance at becoming the GOP nominee for president, which is absolutely disgusting. And it says a lot not only about Trump, but about the hateful bigots in this nation who seem to think he s the right choice.Featured image: Flickr/Twitter",News,"February 20, 2016",lot commander chief schoolyard part ideal criteria president way trump vile hate arena life reason money power privilege person street phone police lifetime asylum trump myth president citizen nothing man terrorism commander chief terrorist fallacy trump question president funeral justice president funeral justice trump president court wife justice repose vice president service jab fact service attack president myth president trump language terrorist language day hatred day man chance nominee president lot trump nation choice image twitter

16871,Uh Oh! Obama Returns From Vacation ‘Fired Up’ For His Last Year In Office,"This last year could be the most devastating year for America with Obama s attempt at  tackling unfinished business . Gun control, closing GITMO and so many other things Obama s got in store for us. While Congress does absolutely nothing! Please remember this and vote accordingly!HONOLULU (AP)   President Barack Obama is returning to the rancor of the nation s capital after two weeks of fun and sun in his native Hawaii, saying he s  fired up  for his final year in office and ready to tackle unfinished business.At the top of Obama s priority list is executive action that is expected to expand when background checks are required for gun purchases. Obama is meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss a three-month review of what actions he could take to help reduce gun violence.The actions, which are staunchly opposed by Republicans and likely to spark a legal fight, underscore Obama s desire to keep up an aggressive agenda in 2016, even as the public s attention shifts to the presidential election.Obama spent much of his vacation out of the public eye, playing golf with friends and dining out on the island of Oahu with his family. He also worked on his final State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 12.The address to Congress is a high-profile opportunity for the president to try to reassure the public about his national security stewardship after the terrorism attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Advisers say Obama will also look for other opportunities to keep security issues at the forefront as he tries to ease Americans  concerns.Despite his deep differences with Republicans, Obama has cited two agenda items for 2016 that have bipartisan support: a free trade agreement with 11 other nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership and changes in the criminal justice system that would reduce incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders. He often points out that the U.S. accounts for 5 percent of the world s population and 25 percent of its inmates.Read more: AP",Government News,"Jan 3, 2016",year year attempt business gun control store congress nothing vote president rancor nation capital fun sun year office business top priority list action background gun attorney lynch month review violence fight desire agenda attention election vacation eye golf island family state union address address congress profile opportunity president public security stewardship terrorism security forefront agenda support trade agreement partnership justice system incarceration percent world population percent

Many thought Giuliani may be picked for Attorney General so this is a bit of a surprise to some, and a horrifying reality for the rest of the world considering the man doesn t have much of any foreign policy experience and is a warhawk.Honestly, the pick doesn t make that much sense, and many thought former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had the role locked up.

14797,HISPANIC ACTIVISTS Promise To Punish Donald Trump At The Polls,"Did you know that a record number of illegals crossed our border last month? While we re focusing on the Syrian refugee influx, our southern border is wide open. Donald Trump has said that he wants to stop the invasion of illegals with a wall which is what our government promised they would do in 2006. Now we have immigrant rights activists promising to throw the 2016 election because Trump wants to put an end to open borders. George Soros and his Open Society are behind this effort. Wasn t this Obama s plan all along?Immigrant rights activists have vowed to sign up 1 million immigrants   mostly Mexicans   for citizenship and then quickly register them to vote in time to punish Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans at the polls in November for their harsh rhetoric.The advocates say the new voters could make a difference in the presidential race, where most of the Republican field has tacked to the right in word and policy, and in key Senate races in Illinois and Florida, where Republicans will be reaching to hang on to critical seats.With nearly 9 million legal immigrants already eligible to become citizens, the 1 million goal is not far-fetched. The activists say they are counting on energizing another 2 million Hispanic citizens who have turned 18 since 2012 and who they believe will turn out to vote to defend fellow Dreamers, or young illegal immigrants, against Republican calls for their deportation. This is a huge amount of latent power,  said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, the group he and other leaders announced Thursday at the National Press Club.The effort is funded in part by the Open Society Foundation, the project of liberal billionaire George Soros.Hispanic leaders insist they are ready to flex political muscles commensurate with their size as the second-largest racial or ethnic group in the country behind whites.Via: WT",politics,"Dec 14, 2015",record number border month refugee border trump invasion wall government election trump end society effort plan citizenship time trump rhetoric difference race field right word policy senate goal deportation amount power executive director partnership group press effort part society foundation project billionaire size group country whites
20755,SHARIA COMPLIANT SWIMSUITS: As Spring Arrives In Europe…Oppressive Burkini’s Will Be All The Rage,"Make no mistake, the Muslim European invaders will not be satisfied until every woman in Europe is donning this head to ankle look on the beaches this summer. The radical Sharia Law adherents who have made the trek from some of the most radical Muslim countries in the world to the  accepting  shores of the EU are about to shake things up and it s going to be very ugly when that happens PARIS   Burkinis aren t showing up at the beaches on either side of the English Channel yet, but the thought that the full head-to-ankle swimsuit might catch on among Muslim women in Europe has already sparked lively debates in Britain and France.The modest Muslim beachwear, which looks like a loose-fitting wetsuit with a hoodie, has been around for about a decade. It has also been banned elsewhere, especially in public swimming pools in Europe and at some Moroccan beach resorts popular with foreign tourists.But most non-Muslims in Europe are only finding out about it now because the popular British department store chain Marks & Spencer has just launched its own burkini line in Europe to appeal to a growing niche market for  Islamic fashion,  combining modern design with Muslim principles of modesty.The arrival of burkinis in mainstream department stores has once again highlighted the differences between the pragmatic British approach toward multiculturalism and France s determined efforts to fend off any challenges to its official policies of secularism.There are about 2.7 million Muslims in Britain, or 4.5 percent of the population, and 5 million, or 8 percent of the population, in France.Marks & Spencer has stores across Europe, Asia and in the Middle East, where it has been selling burkinis for several years. Its online shop promotes two styles in English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch.House of Fraser, a rival British department store group, has come out with its own line. Both chains call the swimsuit burkini, a linguistic mashup of burka and bikini, but neither mentions religion in its advertising.In the  nation of shopkeepers,  as Napoleon is said to have called Britain, the burkini s defenders present it as a product that meets consumer demand.  We have sold this item for a number of years and it is popular with our customers internationally,  a Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said.The conservative tabloid Daily Mail called it  the ultimate proof Britain is truly multicultural  and noted that labels such as H&M, DKNY, Mango and Uniqlo had recently launched Muslim-themed fashion collections.Some critics decried the swimsuit as sexist; one asked why women had to  dress up like frogmen.  But others defended the right of Muslim women to choose.  If I want to buy a burkini from M&S, I bloody well will,  journalist Remona Aly wrote in an op-ed for the liberal Guardian newspaper.Across the channel in France, where the government worries about any sign that its Muslim minority is not fully adapting to the French way of life, the issue quickly escalated into political polemics that presented the burkini as the first step toward women s oppression and Muslim radicalism.Women s Rights Minister Laurence Rossignol said:  Sure, there are women who choose it, and there were American negroes who were for slavery.  She quickly apologized for using the word  negroes  but stood by her message.Advertisement (1 of 1): 0:09 Prominent feminist Elisabeth Badinter called for a boycott of shops that promote Islamic fashions. She said the French have forgotten their founding principle of equality for all, independent of faith, ethnicity or gender, and hesitate to criticize Muslims who stress their minority group status. We shouldn t be afraid of being called Islamophobes,  she argued. The French left has been too tolerant of Muslim communities that force their women to cover their hair and come up with novelties like the burkini, she said.Prime Minister Manuel Valls linked Muslim fashion to the strict Salafi movement, whose extreme fringe inspired the violent attacks in Paris last year, killing 147 people.At a conference on Monday, he said Muslim veils were not a fashion statement but  an enslavement of women  and declared that Salafism, which he described as a path to terrorism, might only represent 1 percent of French Muslims but was  winning the ideological and cultural battle  among them.Muslim community leaders complained that this tarred all Muslims with the terrorist brush, but their exasperated reactions got little coverage in the French media.Valls rarely speaks so bluntly about his concern that French society is being challenged by some of the country s Muslims who identify more as a discriminated religious minority than with the republic s universalist ideals of equality and secularism.Rooted in its 1789 revolution, these ideals have become France s civil religion, and they frame the stronger French reaction to Muslim issues from the more flexible treatment they get in Britain.The vigorous rejection of the burkini comes amid political tensions lingering from last year s bloody attacks.Only last week, President Fran ois Hollande had to abandon a tough law-and-order bill he and Valls suggested last November. The proposed law would have stripped French citizenship from terrorists who have a second passport, a small category of people who will be mostly Muslim immigrants.The conservative opposition and even important parts of his own Socialist Party rejected Hollande s plan.Air France touched this raw nerve recently when it advised stewardesses working on a newly reopened Paris-Tehran route that they would have to cover their hair and wear pants on arrival in Iran. Staff unions protested until the airline announced that only women who volunteer for the flights would be assigned to them.

5467," Racist Attacker Accuses Sikh Family Of Terrorism, Holds Them At Knife Point","On July 9, a 28-year-old Washington man broke into the home of Sikh/Hindu family, holding them at knife point.Preet Moudgil manages the Kettle Falls Inn, located in Kettle Falls, Washington. He and his family, including his parents and three-year-old son, also live on the premises.According to the Spokesman-Review, Moudgil was working the desk at the motel when Kilgore first approached him. He made several racist comments during the encounter, and asked him if he  knew about Guantanamo Bay. Later Kilgore attempted to break down the door that separates Moudgil s apartment from the motel office, but was unsuccessful. He then tried to enter through a second door, located on the first floor. Moudgil locked all the doors and windows to the apartment. Kilgore managed to get inside through a sliding glass door, which he reached by going to the roof of the motel.Once inside the apartment, Kilgore began threatening the family at knife-point. He said  I m going to cut you up because you are a terrorist,  Moudgil told the Spokesman-Review.  All he saw was brown skin. Kilgore shoved Moudgil s elderly father, turning the knife on him. He told the family,  I was trained to kill people like you. Moudgil s father eventually managed to escape the apartment. His mother fled through a back entrance as well, taking the three-year-old child with her.According to the Spokesman-Review, a neighbor finally managed to subdue the man, wrestling the knife away from him before he was able to seriously injure someone.Kilgore was arrested and is facing two counts of second-degree assault, one count of burglary and one count of malicious mischief. Additional charges may be added in the future. He is currently being held on $100,000 bond.Moudgil says that he has lived in the Kettle Falls community for years.  This community is very small. Everybody knows everybody,  he told the Spokesman-Review. Yet he says that he has never heard anything like this happening in the community before.The rise of racist, right-wing hatemongers like Donald Trump, who spew anti-Muslim ignorance and bigotry on a national platform, is undoubtedly linked to the growing number of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S.As The New York Times reported here, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of attacks against members of the Muslim community over the past 10 months.As long as people like Donald Trump are allowed to spew their hateful, racist views on a national stage, the situation will only continue to get worse.Image credt: Viktoria-Lyn Deviant Art CC 3.0 ",News,"July 15, 2016",year man home family knife point kettle kettle family year son spokesman review desk motel encounter bay door apartment motel office door floor apartment glass door roof motel apartment family knife point spokesman review skin knife family people apartment mother entrance year child spokesman neighbor man knife someone degree assault count burglary count future bond kettle community community everybody everybody spokesman review anything community rise racist trump ignorance bigotry platform number hate york times increase number community people trump racist stage situation image art
14769,FLESH EATING DISEASE IN AMERICA? Yep…Syrian Refugees May Be Bringing Disease With Them,"And here we thought terrorism was the only thing we needed to be concerned about There is a risk that Middle Eastern refugees entering the U. S .  could be infected with a flesh-eating disease that is sweeping across Syria.Health agencies confirmed that Syrian refugees have transported leishmaniasis to Lebanon and Turkey, where it has been difficult to manage and treat.Compounding the problem,  patients can be infected with  the parasitic disease  without showing symptoms for weeks, months, or even years,  and  an asymptomatic patient most likely doesn t know that he or she is a carrier. This means the health screening process for refugees could miss the disease entirely .Breitbart Jerusalem spoke with healthcare experts, including an epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC s Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch, which is responsible for guiding the medical screening of the Syrian refugees seeking to enter the U.S.Volcano-like ulcersLeishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites. It is spread almost entirely by sandflies, including those present in the U.S.There are three main types of the disease: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis.Cutaneous is the most common form among Syrians. It manifests in skin sores  that typically develop within a few weeks or months of a sand fly bite. The sores can initially appear as bumps or nodules and may evolve into volcano-like ulcers.Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin ulcers like the cutaneous form ,  as well as mucosal ulcers  that usually damage the nose and mouth.Visceral leishmaniasis, which has also been found among Syrian refugees, is the most serious form and can be fatal. It damages internal organs, usually the spleen and liver, and also affects bone marrow.Refugees transmit to Lebanon, Turkey; threat to Europe, U.S. L ast year, the CDC published a study of a September 2012 outbreak among Syrian refugees. The investigation found:Fifty-nine percent of patients had more than one of the following: disease compromising the function of vital sensory organs (eye, ear, nose, and mouth) (27%); lesions of greater than 5 cm in diameter (49%); disfiguring facial lesions (37%); special forms, such as sporotrichoid or lymphangietic with satellite lesions (9%); and lesions present for more than 12 months  duration.Earlier this month, the news media hyped a story that the Islamic State was causing the spread of leishmaniasis, because     as the U . K . s Mirror newspaper put it  -  militants were  slaughtering innocent people and dumping their bodies in the street. L eishmaniasis has been spreading like wildfire in Syria since the health system collapsed in rebel-held territories in 2011. By 2012, there were already 52,982 documented cases of the disease in SyriaAlso in 2012, the CDC documented that  migration patterns of refugees with cutaneous leishmanias is were identified in Lebanon,  with the health agency producing a helpful illustration showing the disease s  movement from cities in Syria to regions in Lebanon. The peer-reviewed medical journal Pathogens noted that  Lebanon had no cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis prior to 2008 and only  sporadic cases in the following years. After the arrival of refugees, 1,033 cases were confirmed by 2012,  96.6% (998) of which were among Syrian refugees.  Writing at AHC Media, a publication for healthcare professionals, Dr. Philip R. Fischer, Professor of Pediatrics at the Mayo Clinic, documented the spread to Turkey as well: As Syrians leave their homeland, they sometimes carry their germs with them. There have been dramatic increases in the number of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in southeastern Turkey. In Turkey, 69% of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients are Syrians living in tent cities.Fischer also noted a significant risk of the disease spreading to Europe with the arrival of Syrian refugees.As recent news reports have shown ,  many  Syrian refuges don t stay in Turkey and Lebanon. There is a significant risk that cutaneous leishmaniasis will reemerge in southern Europe,  where the natural vector of  the  L. tropica parasite already exists.Leishmaniasis has been endemic to Syria for centuries. Fischer noted that in 1756 a British physician  referred to the illness as Aleppo boil and Aleppo evil.  However, it was minimized over time due to the advent of insecticides.Medical screeningRefugees who enter the U.S. must undergo medical screening according to protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. Each refugee must submit to a physical examination,  including a skin test and possibly a chest x-ray  to check for tuberculosis, as well as a blood test for syphilis.The blood tests do not currently look for leishmani a sis. Clearly,  an attending doctor  could easily spot a patient with obvious skin ulcers. However, leishmani a sis cannot be detected upon physical examination if the patient is asymptomatic, as can be the case for years.Dr. Heather Burke, an epidemiologist from the CDC s Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch, explained to Breitbart News that there is generally a window of three to six months from the initial physical examination until a refugee departs for the U.S.She said a medical examination is valid for six months, and  explained that patients undergo a second examination just prior to departure -  a quicker  fitness to fly  screening. While she conceded  that this final examination is not thorough, she said it would pick up any visible skin lesions. Burke told Brei tbart Jerusalem that she is not aware of a single case of leishmaniasis entering the U.S. via Syrian refugees.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, warned that  most doctors in the U.S. know nothing about leishmaniasis. We d all need to refer patients to tropical diseases specialists,  she told Breitbart Jerusalem.  The treatments are toxic and expensive, and some are not widely available. For Orient, the only sensible public health policy is  for all refugees to pass through a quarantined place like Ellis Island. Officials need to know where they ve been and what diseases occur there. We need sophisticated, reliable screening methods and excellent vector control in any areas where refugees stay.

21363,[VIDEO] CARLY TAKES ON THE VIEW Hacks Only Days After Saying She Has A “Demented Face” And A “Halloween Mask”,"So, if the hosts on this show are just  comedians,  does that mean the low information voters who follow them will stop taking these hacks so seriously? Friday on ABC s  The View,  Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina fought toe to toe with the co-hosts over their comments disparaging her face as demented  and a  Halloween Mask. After small talk, Whoopi Goldberg brought up the subject saying,  How about humor? I m going the bring it up because there are going to be lots of comics saying lots of things. I wondered, because we saw some of the that you were a little upset with us about a comic comment that was made. And so, how will you steel your skin? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you? Fiorina said,  Well, hey, if you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it. I guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump s questions. I have a real thick skin. Joy Behar said,  I defended you against Donald Trump s comment. He s running for president of the United States and he was making a nasty comment about your looks. I took him on. On this show, but, we are comedians here. I make fun of Hillary s pantsuits. Hillary s husband s sex life. Rep. John Boehner s tan. Who else? I don t understand why any politician is exempt from my jokes. Here s the clip from Carly s awesome interview:Fiorina answered,  You know what, Joy. You know what, Joy? You can say whatever you want. You always have. You always will. I m not going to stop that. And don t worry, I have skin plenty thick enough to the take whatever people throw at me. I m making a different point. The different point is this. I think that there are real issues in this nation that we ought to be able to discuss in a fact-based, civil fashion. Michelle Collins said,  I want to add that the demented comment was a poor choice of words. It was responding to something you said during the debates. That people were telling you the smile more. To me, it felt like it was not your natural state of mind. It was not on your looks, it was on your expression. It felt like you were being told to smile more. I m wondering, is that difficult for you? Do you have people coaching you to act or be a different way? Will that help you win the election? Fiorina shot back,  First of all, I don t have people coaching me to act a different way or be a different way. There s a time to smile and a time to be serious. When you re talking about burying a child, it s not time to smile. There are serous issues facing the nation. Goldberg said,  We had you here. I thought we were pretty respectful. I have to tell you, having watched some of the press that you have garnered based on this fake feud with  The View,  I m a little taken aback. Because you kind of said that that somehow liberal women are that we re made uncomfortable by conservative women. We were not uncomfortable with you. Did you think we were uncomfortable with you when you were on? Fiorina said,  First of all, Whoopi. I enjoyed being on the show. The first time. and I m enjoying being on the show the second time. And I think  The View  garnered a lot of publicity over the feud as well. I think that s why we re on. Goldberg said,   We haven t put out any ads or anything.

344, WATCH: Morgan Freeman Uses His Brilliant Movie Scripting Skills To Explain Just How Dangerous The Russia Scandal Is,"So many people want to call the Special Counsel investigation into the Trump campaign s potential collusion with the Russian government to fix the 2016 presidential election  fake news.  They listen to every word out of Donald Trump s mouth, all the while being blind to his systematically dismantling our democratic institutions   and potentially our republic as we know it. However, there is a huge anti-Trump resistance movement going, and we aren t going to sit idly by while this dangerous man   potentially with the aid of the Russian government   destroys all we hold dear as a nation. Well, whether the government cares about this or not, plenty of ordinary   and not so ordinary   citizens do care. One such person is iconic actor Morgan Freeman.Freeman has joined with other concerned citizens to raise awareness about the seriousness of the Russia probe. In his trademark, unmistakable baritone, Freeman announces in a new video for the newly launched Committee to Investigate Russia: We have been attacked. We are at war. Also with this new and potentially powerful organization is actor Rob Reiner. In his most ominous and godly voice, Freeman continues in the Committee s launch video: My fellow Americans, during this past election, we came under attack by the Russian government. I ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened. Freeman couches the whole thing as if it were some wildly brilliant movie script   but in the end reminds us all that it s not, that this is indeed very real and that Trump and Russia are very dangerous. Therefore, we must act.Also involved in the project are anti-Trump GOPers who have more patriotism in their pinkie fingernails than the cowards in Congress could ever know such as radio host Charlie Sykes and Atlantic editor David Frum.This truly is a brilliant project. Perhaps Freeman s compelling voice and brilliant way of expressing this crisis will break the Trump fever before we all perish from it. We can hope, that s for sure.Watch this incredible video below:For generations, ppl have fought to protect democracy. Now it s our turn.

17248,OBAMA JUST GAVE TERRORISTS INCENTIVE TO KIDNAP AMERICANS WITH RECKLESS NEW HOSTAGE POLICY,"THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TO BE THE MOST BUMBLING AND CLUELESS ONE EVER! They ve just incentivized kidnapping and holding hostage anyone and everyone the terrorists think they can get a ransom out of. Brilliant GENERAL JOHN R. ALLEN ON RANSOM FOR HOSTAGES: What is hard to prove is how many Americans have not been kidnapped as a result of the fact that the enemy knows they will not get a penny from us,  said Gen. John R. Allen, who recently retired as the top commander in Afghanistan. The fact that there are Americans in the region who were never taken because they knew there was no advantage to doing so needs to be factored in. The Obama administration was accused Wednesday of giving terrorists an incentive to kidnap as it unveiled a hostage policy overhaul allowing families of U.S. hostages to pay ransom   and allowing the U.S. government to help families communicate with captors. This doesn t fix anything,  Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a leading critic of the administration s hostage policy, told Fox News.  The money that we re going to be paying ISIS is going to be used to buy arms and to buy equipment to fight Americans and to fight the Iraqis. But the White House said the changes are being unveiled with the families and victims in mind. We re not going to abandon you. We re going to stand by you,  Obama said of hostages  families, speaking at the White House on Wednesday.The policy review was formally released shortly before noon, and includes a host of changes beyond the clarifications on ransom discussions   notably, the creation of a new bureaucratic structure for handling hostage cases.The White House plans to establish a Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell responsible for coordinating the recovery of hostages; a Hostage Response Group responsible for coordinating hostage policies; and the position of  special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.  Obama said this is being done to sync up various efforts, citing past coordination problems.Read more: FOX News",Government News,"Jun 24, 2015",administration hostage anyone everyone ransom ransom result fact enemy penny gen commander fact region advantage administration incentive hostage policy overhaul ransom government fix anything critic administration hostage policy news money arms equipment house mind house policy review noon host creation structure hostage house hostage recovery fusion cell recovery hostage response group hostage position envoy hostage news
4326, Rudy Giuliani’s Daughter Announces She’s Backing Hillary Clinton,"Trump s biggest (and most insane) surrogate Rudy Giuliani just got some bad news   his daughter, Caroline, is backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump, her father s new BFF.After posting on her Facebook that she has been  pro Hillary all along,  and making her profile picture Clinton s iconic H, Giuliani confirmed that the account was indeed hers and that her father, Rudy, does know:I love Hillary, I think she s by far the most qualified candidate that we ve had in a long while. My dad knows. I was for Barack in 2012. He knows and is fully comfortable with it and thinks I have a right to my opinion.She did not comment on her father s surrogacy or support for Trump. On her Facebook, after sharing an article titled,  I Wrote That I Despised Hillary Clinton. Today, I Publicly Want To Take That Back,  Giuliani wrote:I ve been pro-Hillary all along, but the people who are willing to open their minds & shift their perspectives are the ones with the power to save our country at this point, so I really respect this [the article]. #imwithher #voteAccording to Politico:The younger Giuliani is not the only one who has drifted from her father this election   the New York Times reported that many of the former mayor s most loyal former aides have rejected Trump s candidacy, and have expressed concerns about Giuliani s embrace of the Manhattan mogul and his more extreme views, specifically on immigration. Some of his former staffers, like his onetime press secretary Matt Higgins, have endorsed Clinton.It seems like Rudy is really off his rocker when everyone around him, including his own family, are voting for the other candidate.One has to wonder what Trump promised or paid Giuliani for his ardent (and downright insane) support.Featured image via Matt Millis McKnight/Getty Images",News,"October 6, 2016",trump surrogate news daughter caroline president trump father picture account father candidate dad right opinion father surrogacy support trump article today people power country point article one father election york times mayor trump candidacy embrace immigration press secretary rocker everyone family candidate trump ardent downright insane support image

3995, Robert Reich’s Conversation With A Fmr. GOP Rep. Exposes Just How Much Of A Fascist Trump Is,"Robert Reich is one of the most respected voices in politics. He also has many friends who are current and former elected officials. He recently posted a most disturbing conversation he had with a friend who just happens to be a former GOP congressman on Facebook, and it exposes just how crazy the Donald Trump phenomenon is, and how much control Trump and his crazy supporters have over the Republican Party. Here is the transcript of that post:Yesterday I spoke with a former Republican member of Congress whom I ve known for years.Me: What do you think of your party s nominee for president?He: Trump is a maniac. He s a clear and present danger to America.Me: Have you said publicly that you won t vote for him?He (sheepishly): No.Me: Why not?He: I m a coward.Me: What do you mean?He: I live in a state with a lot of Trump voters. Most Republican officials do.Me: But you re a former official. You re not running for Congress again. What are you afraid of?He: I hate to admit it, but I m afraid of them. Some of those Trumpistas are out of their fu*king minds.Me: You mean you re afraid for your own physical safety?He: All it takes is one of them, you know.Me: Wait a minute. Isn t this how dictators and fascists have come to power in other nations? Respected leaders don t dare take a stand.He: At least I m no Giuliani or Gingrich or Pence. I m not a Trump enabler.Me: I ll give you that.He: Let me tell you something. Most current and former Republican members of Congress are exactly like me. I talk with them. They think Trump is deplorable. And they think Giuliani and Gingrich are almost as bad. But they re not gonna speak out. Some don t want to end their political careers. Most don t want to risk their lives. The Trump crowd is just too dangerous. Trump has whipped them up into a g*ddamn frenzy.And here is the embed:This is what has happened to one of America s two major political parties. They have propped up a literal fascist and are currently doing all they can to put him in the Oval Office and give him control of the most dangerous nuclear arsenal in the world. That is frighteningly, chillingly irresponsible. If we all die, you know who to thank.These people are cowards, and you cannot be a leader and a coward at the same time. They have no leadership skills. Part of being a good leader is doing the right thing when it counts, and it s clear that the current GOP leadership is incapable of doing that.All I can hope is that the entire GOP is just like Reich s friend   and when they enter the privacy of the voting booth, they vote to save the world from that lunatic that somehow rose to the top of the GOP presidential ticket, rather than voting to save their own political hides.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 31, 2016",politics conversation friend congressman trump phenomenon control trump party transcript post yesterday member congress party nominee president maniac danger vote coward state lot trump official congress afraid fu king safety minute power dare stand pence trump something congress talk trump crowd trump frenzy embed fascist office control arsenal world people leader coward time leadership part leader thing leadership friend privacy booth world somehow top ticket image joe
4409, Hillary Clinton Mocks Donald Trump With An AMAZING Tweetstorm At 3 AM,"This is hilariously perfect.Hillary Clinton has already responded to Republican nominee Donald Trump s 3am temper tantrum on Twitter but decided to double down early Saturday morning by mocking him with a 3am Twitter barrage of her very own. Except whereas Trump focused on hurling sexist insults, Hillary focused on touting public service and threw in some characteristic Trump-speak.It s 3:20am.

1267, Kellyanne Conway’s Husband Blasts Trump’s Travel Ban Tweets After Turning Down Job Offer,"Kellyanne Conway may still be loyal to Donald Trump, but her husband seems far less impressed with our Tweeter-in-Chief. On Monday morning, George Conway took to Twitter, Trump s favorite medium, to blast the president for his early morning tweets about his Muslim ban.On Saturday evening, Trump exploited the terrorist attacks in London to push for his Muslim ban.

18017,OBAMA THREATENS TO SURFACE FROM LEFTIST BUNKER To Speak Out Against Trump’s Plan To End DACA,"Contrary to what the media would like us to believe, Obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that President Trump put in place by executive order. Neither he nor his Democratic henchmen remained silent when President Trump desperately tried to convince Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the Charlottesville controversy. The media celebrated Obama s post-Charlotseville tweet designed to make our former President look like he was in favor of uniting the nation (which we all know is a bald-faced lie), while falsely giving the impression that President Trump was choosing sides.Before the media gets into a full-blown tizzy about Obama using social media to bash our current president over DACA, they might consider that most of America aren t stupid enough to believe that Valerie Jarrett didn t move into Barack Obama s DC home because he needed a friend to play checkers with. He may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president, but one thing we do know is that he and Valerie Jarrett aren t sitting on their hands, while President Trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen, including DACA.Hotair   You know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding Trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option. A  Trump vs. Obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and O knows it; the most brutal thing he can do to Trump is to deny him that our-guy-versus-their-guy dynamic. I don t think it s crazy to believe that Trump s job approval would be five to 10 points higher if Obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly. By withholding his criticism, he s made it possible for  soft  Republicans and right-leaning independents to criticize POTUS without fear of being accused that they re carrying O s water.Two days before President Trump s inauguration, Obama warned him that he would come out against him if Trump rescinded his unconstitutional DACA.Why attack Trump now? I think there s more to it than DACA just being near and dear to Obama s heart. He knows that congressional Republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree. Immigration is a fraught issue for the GOP under the best of circumstances but DREAMers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children. They re the one class of illegals about whom even Trump speaks warmly. In fact, the president s going to end DACA not because he wants to but because Republican AGs are squeezing him to do so, replete with the threat of a court battle; even then, Trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months. The entire GOP (apart from Steve King) will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing DREAMers. All they ask in return is some face-saving security measures so that they can semi-plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty.Having Obama wade in publicly on the side of DREAMers will complicate all of that. With O banging the drum for amnesty, Republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty. Populists will have a field day attacking Ryan and McConnell (and Trump?) for essentially doing Obama s bidding by negotiating for a DREAM bill. Some congressional Republicans might start to get cold feet. The more hostile Trump and the congressional GOP become towards a DREAM deal as part of a backlash towards Obama, the more ammo Schumer will have to say that Republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government. The whole GOP  we like DREAMers too!  messaging effort will be scrambled. Either negotiations will end up collapsing in Congress, with Dems using the DREAM failure against Republicans next fall, or Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by Barack farking Obama, which is about the RINO-iest move a modern Republican is capable of making. Either the GOP base ends up angry at the White House or everyone else does. Obama  speaking out  is tinder for the match Trump is about to strike.Let s hope President Trump will be able to locate and tweet this pesky little video of candidate Obama telling his constituents how he disagrees with law breaking illegal aliens living and working in America:",left-news,"Sep 4, 2017",media policy president trump place executive order president trump congress opportunity handling controversy media post tweet president look favor nation bald lie impression president trump sides media blown tizzy media president move home friend checkers opposition president thing president everything guy camera day trump disaster silence option trump fight issue right president thing guy guy trump job approval criticism fear water days president trump inauguration trump attack trump heart degree immigration issue case class fact president threat court battle trump plug apart king voter return face security argue base roll wade side drum idea place field day trump bidding dream bill trump dream deal part backlash cruel mistake government effort congress dream failure fall trump amnesty move republican base house everyone tinder match trump president trump video candidate law
544," Ivanka’s Rabbi Breaks Ranks, Roundly Condemns Trump On Charlottesville","Donald Trump expects unwavering loyalty from everyone around him. That is likely why there has been radio silence from his daughter Ivanka, who is a Jewish convert, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is a genetic Jew. Trump s grandchildren are Jewish as well, of course. However, that did not stop him from defending the white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Hitler sympathizers, and other assorted racists who marched with torches through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia shouting racist and anti-Semitic slogans.Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the Rabbi who helped Ivanka convert to Judaism is not impressed. In fact, he seems to be quite outraged. Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein is beside himself with rage at Trump s response to the Charlottesville tragedy, and rightly so. He wrote a letter condemning Trump s remarks, saying: We are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism, and the renewed vigor of the neo-Nazis, KKK, and alt-right. While we avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation President Trump has offered in his response to this act of violence. Rabbi Lookstein released the letter publicly, and likely will be attacked by Trump. The divider-in-chief may have done the unthinkable with this one and divided his own family. Ivanka and Jared take their faith very seriously, and Ivanka has been a devout Jew since 2010 and is raising her children in a seriously observant Jewish home. They likely already have a hard time working in Trump s White House, which is chock full of open racists, neo-Nazis, and anti-Semites. Jared has family members who died in the Nazi Holocaust. There is simply NO WAY, he is happy with Trump s equating white supremacists with those fighting against that kind of hate.This is especially evident considering the fact that Ivanka immediately denounced the hate and called the groups perpetuating it out by name in ways her father has repeatedly refused to do.Ivanka and Jared, do you really want your Jewish children growing up in this environment? Loyalty to your Nazi father simply is not worth it. Take a stand and resign from his White House.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,"August 17, 2017",trump loyalty everyone silence daughter convert son law trump course streets racist surprise rabbi convert fact rabbi emeritus rage trump response tragedy letter trump resurgence bigotry vigor politics equivalency equivocation president trump response act violence rabbi letter divider chief family devout home time trump house family holocaust way trump kind hate fact hate name ways father environment loyalty father stand resign house image

4428," USA Today BREAKS Neutrality, Begs Readers Not To Vote For Trump","In an unusual and shocking move, the editorial board of USA Today did something no one say coming: for the first time in their 34-year history, they broke their rule of neutrality, and blasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Never before taking any side   let alone taking a position of any sort   the board labeled Trump a danger to America, writing that his  erratic,   ill-equipped  personality (as well as his  checkered  business past) disqualify him from the presidency.Writing not in support of Clinton but rather in sheer resentment of Trump, the board blasted the nominee for his unconventional and downright  prejudiced  ways:This year, the choice isn t between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences. This year, one of the candidates   Republican nominee Donald Trump   is, by unanimous consensus of the Editorial Board, unfit for the presidency   He has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.The board called on voters   much like Ted Cruz did at the RNC   to vote their conscience and follow their convictions, asking them to  resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue,  and  by all means vote, just not for Donald Trump. One of the biggest reasons for the plea of deflection is due in part to Trump s misguided and dangerous view of the world, from his blunders on NATO to his high regard for Vladimir Putin.Trump s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent. It s not just Democrats who say this. Scores of Republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling Trump s foreign policy vision  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.  In a Wall Street Journal column this month, Robert Gates, the highly respected former Defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half-century, described Trump as  beyond repair. The stinging rebuke comes just days after Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence penned an op-ed in the newspaper outlining why voters should choose Trump and himself.Talk about great timing.USA Today s half endorsement, half non-endorsement follows a slew of newspaper who are famously bucking Donald Trump (and instead endorsing Clinton). USA Today s editorial board expressed deep concerns for Hillary Clinton, citing her emails, her candor, and issues with her entitlement.Nonetheless, the board sent a strong message in an age of neutrality: the stakes could not be higher, and we as a nation cannot take a risk with Donald Trump in the White House.Much like the onslaught received by the Arizona Republic, USA Today is sure to feel the wrath of Trump supporters in the coming days. However, a poll on the paper s website asks readers if they agree with the board s decision or not. Out of almost nine thousand votes (so far), 85 percent agree.That s a good start.Good for the USA Today editorial board   they have a backbone, and it s about time those in the media stand up to the racist, fear mongering bully that is Donald J.

4630, Rape Apparently Doesn’t Earn Jail Time Anymore – Even If The Victim Is Only Two Years Old,"If you are a young white male in America, apparently you are free to stick your genitalia into whomever you please without having to fear that you will end up in prison. Consent be damned. Proof of this is the disgusting case of an Iowa teen who raped a toddler   on camera   and was given a free pass when he was finally hauled in front of a judge for his repulsive crimes.Kraigen Grooms has admitted to raping the 2-year-old in April of 2013 when he was 16 years old. Not only did he rape the small child, but he did it on camera so he could livestream the sexual assault for another pervert to watch online. Investigators believe that the attack was premeditated, and also that he had plans to rape a 3-year-old boy in the same manner.Grooms was arrested in March 2014, when he was 17. Initially, he was charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a felony that could have put him in prison for 25 years. However, after spending two years in a juvenile detention center and county jail, he cut a deal and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child in July. This week, Judge Randy Degeest handed Groom, who also goes by the alias Kraigen Simmers, a 10-year suspended sentence and sent him home.This means that he will see absolutely no prison time for raping a 2-year-old. Let that sink in for a minute.This is just the most recent in a string of high-profile sexual assault cases that have ended with the rapist getting a slap on the wrist and being sent on his way. The most well-known of these cases being that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and was given just six months in jail, but ended up only serving three before being released.Is there any question that anyone who rapes a toddler   a f*cking toddler   should be behind bars until hell freezes over?

203, Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By British Lawmakers For Lying About Rising Crime Rate In UK,"Donald Trump stuck his foot in his mouth again and pissed off our closest ally.A recent report indicates that the crime rate is rising in the United Kingdom due to gang-related activities and hate crimes against Muslims.Of course, rather than read the report to understand it, Trump took to Twitter to bellow about how  radical Islamic terror  is the cause and seemed to promote his Muslim ban as the way to  keep America safe! Just out report:  United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.  Not good, we must keep America safe!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2017Trump s ridiculously uninformed commentary on the crime rate in the United Kingdom did not go over very well with British lawmakers, who promptly humiliated Trump with facts.Labour Party MP Chris Bryant told Trump to back off and reminded him that America has a massive gun violence problem. Butt out of it mister president,  Bryant said.  You have more murders in New York or Chicago every year than we do in the whole country so we re not going to take any lessons from you. Labour Party MP Stephen Doughty chimed in by telling the Daily Mail that Trump is  talking nonsense  and also took aim at Trump for not doing anything to stop mass shootings in America. Donald Trump would be better placed looking at issues in his own country such as the huge number of deaths from gun violence which despite repeated atrocities from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas, the US government have failed to take action on,  Doughty said.Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson slammed Trump as well, and went so far as to blame Trump s xenophobia for the rise in hate crimes. Hate crime is up and it is fueled by the kind of populist xenophobia you peddle,  she said.Needless to say, the British people were not happy about Trump s comments either.please don t mention us in your propaganda, we all hate you here.

15309,"RUSH LIMBAUGH: TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION STANCE MAY WIN REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS","Trump s not dropping in the polls in spite of the GOP and mainstream media s best efforts On The Rush Limbaugh Show, the popular conservative talk radio host discussed Donald Trump s immigration plan and told listeners that Trump s meteoric rise in the polls is entirely attributable to his mainstream position on immigration, which appeals to a broad array of voters.In a lengthy segment, Limbaugh laid out several of the policy items addressed in Trump s in-depth immigration proposal, such as ending birthright citizenship, deporting illegal immigrants, and building a border fence.Limbaugh argued that Trump s mainstream stance on immigration stands in stark contrast to the extreme position held by the open borders class that runs the country:Now, the inside-the-Beltway people, when they hear that, they cringe,  Oh, my God, don t say that s what Republicans [stand for]   oh, God.  [But the] people are standing up and cheering. They don t want their country given away, for crying out loud! [ ] I m telling you, that one has people standing up and cheering.Limbaugh explained that Trump s success is,  due to substance and it is due to immigration,  insisting that,  It s obvious that that issue is the foundational issue for Trump.  Limbaugh told listeners that Trump has used the issue of immigration to distinguish himself from all of the other Republican candidates currently running:It s amazing. Sixteen people are running for the presidency, and  15 of them are perceived to have essentially the same policy on immigration. One of them is entirely different from the other 15, and he s the one who s leading. Now, don t you think people inside the Beltway should be able to look at this and put two and two together and figure out what is causing this? They can chalk it up to celebrity, they can chalk it up to pop culture, they can chalk it up to circus.Limbaugh argued that Trump has been able to surpass all other Republican candidates because he has adopted a position on immigration that prioritizes the desires of the American voter above the desires of Republican donors and inside-the-beltway elites:Both parties, conservative-liberal, Republican-Democrat, I don t think they have the slightest idea what the vast majority of people in this country think about immigration and what s happening to the country, and they don t want any part of it. And of course the establishment is seen as wanting to ramrod their view of immigration down everybody s throat. Trump s the only guy standing up against it  I don t think these people have any idea just how angry, frightened, fearful, a pretty big majority of the people in this country are, that we are losing the country, and we re losing it because of immigration  And they see both parties in cahoots to make it happen, and they don t understand it. People that love America do not understand this. I mean, even when you tell  em,  Well, big-money donors say this because they want X, Y, and Z,  it still doesn t make any sense. How does that trump patriotism? How does all that matter more to these people, elected officials, than patriotism, love of country, America, shining city on a hill and all that, why does that not matter anymore? And there isn t a single candidate for president addressing the issue in a way that resonates with the American people, particularly Republican primary voters, not one, until Donald Trump comes along.Limbaugh explained that Trump s position represents the mainstream view on immigration:  Trump is not seen as a radical at all in this by average, ordinary Americans. He s not seen as an extremist. He s not seen as a fringe kook.  Instead,  Trump s ideas are not fringe, are not outliers, they are mainstream. They represent the views and the attitudes of the people who make this country work. To reinforce this point, Limbaugh highlighted a recent article by The Washington Examiner s Byron York which  found a recent academic paper published by Stanford Professor David Broockman and Berkeley PhD candidate Douglas Ahler, and it suggests a majority of the public s views on immigration are closer to Trump s than to the advocates of comprehensive immigration reform. Limbaugh argued that by embracing a platform of immigration moderation   i.e. returning immigration to lower, more normal historical levels from today s surging record highs  Trump will appeal to a wide-range of Democratic and Independent voters.Republican Party officials, inside-the-Beltway officials tell us that we can t win the White House anymore without getting additional votes besides just Republican votes  We need to get Democrats. We need to get independents  Okay, fine, well, guess what, who s doing that? Who is expanding the party beyond what it is normally thought to be? Trump, of all people. And yet they re lowering the hammer on the guy each and every day, when it is Donald Trump who is executing what the Republican Party says they need to win.Indeed, polling commissioned by the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC) recently found that a populist position on immigration has mass appeal amongst women, minorities, and non-Republican voters in addition to the base of Republican voters.Limbaugh believes that other Republican candidates could see similar success if they were to adopt Trump s position on immigration:If just one of these Republican candidates   just one of them   had come out forcefully for America on this immigration business, Trump wouldn t even exist as a candidate. Well, he might exist, but he wouldn t have such a free road in this one issue.In fact, Limbaugh predicted that Trump s announcement will influence many candidates on the critical issue of immigration:The me-toos are beginning.  Hey, my proposal is just like Trump s.  You watch  The me-toos are now starting. Rather than people trying to steal it, people are gonna want to get in on it. It has the potential here to be a genuine movement, so transformative that the inside-the-Beltway people, even while studying it and looking straight at it, still stand a chance of being blindsided by it.Limbaugh also made the larger point that much of the hand-wringing in the GOP over Trump s immigration platform is curious given that uncontrolled immigration has put one of the largest states in America firmly outside the reach of the GOP, and if it is not curtailed, more states like Virginia will follow:If you want to find the future of the Republican Party and the country, look at California. There isn t a single Republican in statewide office. There never will be in the future. It s not gonna happen. The Republican Party practically doesn t exist statewide. The economy in California, you talk about inequality, the haves and have-nots, it s no more pronounced anywhere in the country than in California.You don t have to go back that far where the Republican Party owned it. Routinely elected governors, those governors became presidential candidates. And I ll tell you when you can tie it to. You can tie the end of the Republican Party in California to 1986, and that was the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty immigration bill. We re talking back then 3.9 million illegal aliens granted amnesty. Since then it s been curtains for the Republican Party, which means constant victory for the Democrat Party. They have shaped that state, and it s a mess. And it s a harbinger of where we re going nationwide.

2017, Paul Ryan Admits Obamacare Will Be Law ‘For The Foreseeable Future’ After GOP Bill FAILS (VIDEO),"Well, folks, your health care is safe for the  foreseeable future  according to Speaker Paul Ryan. After the GOP abruptly pulled their healthcare bill from consideration Friday, spirits among the worst among us were pretty dim. We just pulled it,  Donald Trump told the Washington Post after the decision to nix the embarrassing disaster of a bill, noting that he doesn t  blame  Ryan for this huge loss. Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains. We re feeling those growing pains today,  Ryan told reporters, noting that  this is a disappointing day  for those whose biggest dream is stripping healthcare from millions and that  doing big things is hard. All of us, all of us   myself included   will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment,  he added.How we got to this moment is that the Affordable Care Act is immensely popular. While it could use some improvements   like a move toward universal healthcare   the GOP s effort to  repeal and replace  is not as popular with voters as it may have seemed on the campaign trail.But they won t actually reflect on that, will blame Obama, and will present Americans with something equally horrible somewhere down the line.Ryan was forced to utter one of the most beautiful 22 words we have heard since Donald Trump was kinda-sorta elected by less than half of the population: ObamaCare will remain the law of the land until it s replaced. We re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future. The president gave his all in this effort. He did everything he possibly could to help people see the opportunity we have with this bill. He really has been fantastic,  Ryan said. Still, we have to do better and we will. This battle is won. The Affordable Care Act is safe for now. But the war is far from over, and all of us must fight each day to oppose the GOP s hateful agenda.The only thing standing between them and the destruction of all we hold dear is us.Watch Ryan s shamed admission below:""Obamacare is the law of the land and it will remain the law of the land until it's replaced,"" Speaker Ryan says: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/9F3MnW7oMR  CBS News (@CBSNews) March 24, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 24, 2017",health care future speaker bill consideration trump post decision disaster bill blame loss opposition party party today day dream millions time moment moment care act move effort campaign trail something line trump half population law land future president effort everything people opportunity bill battle care act war day thing destruction admission law land law land speaker pic twitter news march image
2921, Trump Thanks Fox News For Kissing His A** And Gets Appropriately HAMMERED For It,"Donald Trump s Inaugural Address received poor reviews for it s divisive and negative tone, not to mention the countless lies and promises he won t keep. But apparently, Fox News liked it that way.Trump portrayed America as a dystopian wasteland where inner cities are run by criminals, the military is crippled, and poverty is a plague across the land even though crime is down, the economy is strong with unemployment below five percent, and the military is the most funded in the world.Trump also suggested that President Obama was a tyrant who kept control of the government away from the people even though President Obama was duly elected by the people in 2008 and 2012 with a bigger popular vote and electoral vote margins than Trump received in 2016.Fox News, however, loved Trump s speech and Trump appreciated them kissing his ass so he tweeted about it on Saturday morning.A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!

1854, Bill O’Reilly’s Show Bizarrely Cut Short In Wake Of Advertisers’ Mass Exodus (DETAILS),"The New York Times recently published a bombshell story about the culture of sexual harassment at Fox News, and their star host, Bill O Reilly, is at the center of it. The Times story says that O Reilly and Fox News paid five women more than $13 million in hush money who accused O Reilly of sexually harassing them. As a result, more than 50 important advertisers have pulled out of advertising their goods on The O Reilly Factor.In fact, so many ads have been pulled that Thursday s show included almost no ads at all, and certainly none from nationally recognized brands. Seemingly, as a result of all of these companies running as far and fast as they can from the public relations nightmare that is Bill O Reilly, the Thursday night edition of O Reilly s show was bizarrely cut short.There was no explanation for the abrupt ending to O Reilly s broadcast. The show usually lasts an hour, but was only on for 45 minutes. Throughout the show, O Reilly had kept promising a funny segment with Jesse Waters, who usually goes out and talks to people on the street in a mean-spirited segment meant to embarrass people and make them look bad on the air. That segment never came.Instead of the Waters segment, at the end of O Reilly s strangely short show, fellow Fox anchor Shep Smith spent the extra 15 minutes reporting on the goings on in Syria. This was prior to the world knowing that Trump had launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian airfield in response to the chemical weapons attack, so it s not like this was any sort of breaking news segment.When O Reilly s extra 15 minutes was up, Smith s time ended, and Tucker Carlson s show started right on cue, with no mention of what happened to O Reilly, and no explanation.Hopefully, this is a sign that Bill O Reilly is on his way out at Fox, and his toxic message will poison the airwaves no more.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 7, 2017",york times bombshell story culture harassment news star host bill center times story news money result goods factor fact show none result bill night edition show explanation show hour show segment people street mean segment meant people air segment segment end show fox anchor smith world trump cruise airfield response chemical sort news segment time show cue mention explanation sign bill way fox message image video screen capture
3454, WATCH: Watergate Reporter Says Trump Lies And Denies Facts More Than Richard Nixon Ever Did,"Donald Trump hasn t even been sworn in yet and he s already beating Richard Nixon when it comes to being a liar.Forty-four years have passed since the Watergate scandal dominated the news. Carl Bernstein was one of the Washington Post reporters who broke the scandal wide open.Throughout his presidency, Richard Nixon repeatedly lied and misled people. And when Watergate happened, he tried to cover it up by any means necessary. In the end, Nixon was forced to resign because he was going to be impeached. He remains the only president who has ever resigned the office and the Watergate scandal became the scandal by which other political scandals are judged.Well, Donald Trump has spent the last few days defending Russia and desperately trying to cover up the fact that Russia hacked into our election to help Trump win. He doesn t believe the CIA assessment concluding that Russia interfered and claimed on Fox News Sunday that Democrats are pushing a lie to taint his  great victory. In short, Trump threw American intelligence agencies under the bus to defend Putin and accused Democrats of making up a scandal. This is something that Richard Nixon would do. But unlike Trump, Nixon didn t deny facts at every turn, nor did he lie every time he spoke.Trump does exactly that on Twitter every day, launching attacks and smear campaigns against anyone who criticizes him or runs a story he doesn t like. Trump also exaggerates his supposed accomplishments like the Carrier deal, which is nothing more than a windfall for Carrier at taxpayer expense while jobs are slashed anyway.Carl Bernstein knows this first-hand, which is why he declared Trump a bigger liar than Nixon during an appearance on CNN. Trump lives and thrives in a fact-free environment,  Bernstein said.  No president, including Richard Nixon, has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this president-elect does. And it has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism that he and his presidency are projecting and the danger of it is obvious and he s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue, not his own conduct. Bernstein used Trump s Carrier deal as an example of his lies and Trump s attack against a steelworkers union leader as an example of Trump denying facts and lashing out at anyone who dares to call him out. He doesn t go to a fact-based argument, he goes to an emotion-base argument,  Bernstein pointed out.  What we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth. Jeffrey Lord, of course, whined about Bernstein s analysis, but Berstein stood by what he said and doubled down. We now have a president-elect who, in terms of truthfulness Richard Nixon was nothing, in terms of lying, compared to what we have seen from Donald Trump. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is more unfit to be president than Richard Nixon. We could very well be looking at the most scandal-ridden administration in American history and it hasn t even taken over yet. At this rate, Trump might as well resign now before he becomes the first president to lose an impeachment trial.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"December 11, 2016",trump scandal news carl post scandal presidency people end president office scandal scandal trump days russia fact russia election assessment russia news lie victory trump intelligence bus scandal something deny turn time trump twitter day anyone story trump carrier deal nothing windfall carrier taxpayer expense hand liar appearance trump fact environment president fact fact way president elect something sense authoritarianism presidency danger conduct press issue conduct trump carrier deal example trump attack union leader example trump anyone fact argument emotion base argument campaign disdain truth lord course analysis stood president elect truthfulness nothing trump video trump president scandal administration history rate trump president trial image
13," WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As ‘Kooky,’ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed. But the media isn t quite saying what Trump wants. They ve been doing analysis and discussion all day long rather than praising it for the grand achievement Trump believes it is. The GOP has increasingly sounded exactly like Trump when it comes to media coverage, and coverage of the tax scam is no different. Coverage of Trump in general hasn t changed.Today, Lindsey Graham went after the media for portraying Trump as a  kook,  and unfit for office (they wouldn t be doing their job if they weren t telling the truth, though). Graham said: You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as some kind of kook; not fit to be president. Jake Tapper notes that he himself has never labeled Trump that way. But then he points out something rather odd about Graham s opinion.

1903, Inventor Of The Worldwide Web Just DESTROYED Trump’s ‘Disgusting’ Bill To Sell Internet History,"This week, Donald Trump signed a deeply concerning bill that allows internet service providers (ISPs) to sell the browsing histories of their customers to advertisers. It s a disgusting piece of legislation that has Americans around the country concerned for their privacy and has left them feeling vulnerable   and the inventor of the worldwide web himself had some pretty strong feelings toward it as well.Tim Berners-Lee is the computer scientist responsible for the worldwide web we use today. Having seen how much his invention has grown since its creation in 1989, he says he has been  disgusted  by the law Trump just signed in, and has slammed both Trump and the GOP for it in an interview with the Guardian.According to Berners-Lee (and many Americans), user privacy should not be a partisan issue and he was quite shocked that despite facing so much public outcry, the Republican Party rolled this legislation through anyway. Lee said: That bill was a disgusting bill, because when we use the web, we are so vulnerable. Privacy, a core American value, is not a partisan thing. Democrats fight for it and Republicans fight for it, too, maybe even more. So I am very shocked that the Republican party has managed to suggest that it should be trashed; if anyone follows up on this direction there will be a massive pushback   and there must be a massive pushback! Berners-Lee s statement came with a warning as well   he predicted that the Federal Communications Commission would face massive protests if the net neutrality regulations that former President Barack Obama put into place were compromised. He said: If they take away net neutrality, there will have to be a tremendous amount of public debate as well. You can bet there will be public demonstrations if they do try to take it away.

21402,UN Celebrates Its 70th Anniversary With Communist Statue In NYC Park,"In case you hadn t heard, Obama signed a new UN development plan to make America a socialist nation by 2030. Yes, it s true and the UN is celebrating by unveiling a statue celebrating our  global citizenship .  Here are a few of the important points in the plan that spell out the  shared responsibility  with the globe and then information below about the statue in NYC: Communists say that Socialism is the stepping stone to Communism, and the UN 2030 Sustainable Development agenda won t fail to disappoint them. Socialism hinges on several economic factors which coincide with sustainable development goals. They are universal healthcare, universal education, universal employment, and wealth redistribution. All of these are outlined clearly in the UN agreement.For example on the subject of universal healthcare, on page 6, section 26 of  Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  in the section titled  The New Agenda  it states:26. To promote physical and mental health and well-being, and to extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health coverage and access to quality health care. No one must be left behind. We commit to accelerating the progress made to date in reducing newborn, child and maternal mortality by ending all such preventable deaths before 2030. We are committed to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education.This goal is also repeated as Sustainable Development Goal #3, page 14, section 3.8:3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.As it pertains to wealth redistribution and universal employment the proof is found on page 7, section 27:27. We will seek to build strong economic foundations for all our countries. Sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is essential for prosperity. This will only be possible if wealth is shared and income inequality is addressed. We will work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.Universal employment is also mentioned on page 12 as Sustainable Development Goal #8:Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.The last time I read the words  shared responsibility  it was when I discovered that the Obamacare fine imposed by the IRS for failing to have health insurance was called the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment. While I thought this had to be a veiled reference to some Marxist dictator s quote, it now appears that it has more to do with the Progressive globalization movement.This weekend the United Nations is set to celebrate its 70th anniversary. As apart of those celebrations the U.N. will unveil a new work of art in New York City titled Enlightened Universe. The U.N. claims this new sculpture is all about Global Citizenship and Shared Responsibility: In celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, a monumental art installation entitled Enlightened Universe will be unveiled on Saturday, 24 October, at 4:30 p.m. at the Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. The installation   created by Spanish artist Crist bal Gabarr n   is presented by The Gabarron Foundation in partnership with the United Nations.The commemorative work of art depicts 70 life-size figures joined in hand around a central globe, creating a human chain of global citizenship, respect for nature and shared responsibility. The sphere measures 6,371 millimetres in diameter to correspond to the Earth s average radius of 6,371 kilometres. The 70 figures represent the 70 years of the United Nations. Rumsey Playfield, where the sculpture is to be erected, is an area of the Central Park where concerts and other events are held.Considering that the new United Nations Sustainable Development Plan calls for the United States to become a Socialist nation by 2030, it s not surprising that Obamacare, which was designed to push the U.S. towards government run healthcare, and the United Nations, would  share  the same collectivist, albeit Marxist, vocabulary.Via: Progressives Today",left-news,"Oct 21, 2015",case un development plan nation yes un statue citizenship plan responsibility globe information statue socialism stone communism development agenda fail socialism development education employment wealth redistribution agreement example subject page section world agenda development section agenda health life expectancy health coverage access quality health care one progress date child mortality access health care family information education goal development goal page section achieve health coverage risk protection access health care access quality redistribution employment proof page section growth prosperity wealth income inequality people employment empowerment work employment page development goal goal promote growth employment work time responsibility fine health insurance individual payment reference dictator quote movement weekend anniversary apart work art york city sculpture citizenship responsibility celebration anniversary art installation universe playfield park installation artist foundation partnership work life size hand globe chain citizenship respect nature responsibility diameter earth radius playfield sculpture area park development plan nation towards government share collectivist today
13547,SHOCKING COMMENTS: Hillary Stirs The Pot Inciting More Racial Divide With More Lies,"Hillary Clinton used a CNN interview on Friday to completely embrace the Democrats  claim that white people and cops must change to help reduce the number of African-Americans killed in tense exchanges with cops.   BREITBART NEWSLet s face it, Hillary needs votes from the black community come November. What better way to do it than to continue the false narrative that Obama has been using for so long.The facts are just too inconvenient for the black community and the politicians who pander for their votes. The truth is never spoken for fear of being called a  racist  or for fear of losing votes.  The black community needs some tough love and that involves honesty. Here s a bit of truth that Hillary and Obama choose to ignore:African-American communities have a role in reducing police-encounter deaths, which usually occur in tense engagements between a few cops and a few suspects with extensive criminal histories.In general, young African-American men are far more likely to commit crimes than young white men, young Asian men or young Latino men. A November 2011 report by the Justice Department showed that young African-American men are just 1 percent of the population, yet are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of murders in the nation.Clinton suggested that people who disagree with her agenda are racists.  There is so much more to be done  we can t be engaging in hateful rhetoric or incitement of violence, we need to be bringing people together   we need more love and kindness. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 8, 2016Hillary Clinton used a CNN interview on Friday to completely embrace the Democrats  claim that white people and cops must change to help reduce the number of African-Americans killed in tense exchanges with cops.

I m going to be talking to white people, we re the ones who have to start listening to the legitimate cries coming from our African-American fellow citizens,  she said. We ve got to figure out what is happening when routine traffic stops, when routine arrests, escalate into killings   Clearly, there seems to be a terrible disconnect between many police departments and officers and the people they have sworn to protect,  she said.Federal policing guidelines are needed because  we have 18,000 police departments  [some of which need more training to] go after systemic racism, which is a reality, and to go after systemic bias,  she said.

252," SURPRISE: The People Behind ‘Fearless Girl’ Statue Were Cynical, Greedy, Anti-Feminist Men","There were a lot of arguments online after the  Fearless Girl  statue was erected in front of the Wall Street Bull. Many people thought it was a perfect representation of standing up to the male-dominated culture of the financial industry, while others felt like it was just another commercial effort to cash in on the popularity of public companies suddenly growing a conscience and adopting policies that appease  social justice warriors  (also known as decent human beings).Unfortunately, one of those arguments has been proven right.According to the New York Post, the firm behind the statue that went up ostensibly to  promote gender equality,  State Street Corp, was caught underpaying 300 female employees, along with 15 more who were black.After the company was audited by the Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, they promised they would come up with the money, but in the meantime, it just looks bad. The company settled for $5 million, an astounding amount, considering the relatively small number of affected employees.How far will this faux-minism set women back? None. Real feminists don t require icons or court confirmation of oppression.Twitter was similarly unimpressed:Modern feminism sometimes suffers from a lack of explicit examples of sexism.

Noted misogynist and all-around piece of shit James Woods chimed in, of course, although to pick up his subtle dig at feminism requires reading the replies to his tweet   which he was fishing for. A full complement of alt-right Trump trolls joined the party, and anti-feminists everywhere saw the hypocrisy and cynicism of this one company as emblematic of the whole:The Fearless Girl statue is utterly moronic, but it exemplifies the feminist movement.

20305,SHOCKING VIDEO CONNECTS BEYONCÉ And OBAMA TO DALLAS COP KILLER,"Because Bob Price at Breitbart News had the courage to attend and film an unbelievable Black Panther rally aimed at threatening cops in Houston last year, America was able to see just exactly how hateful and dangerous this group really is. Obama s celebrity bestie, Beyonc promoted the Black Panthers to a staggering 114.4 MILLION viewers in her anti-cop, anti-white performance during her Super Bowl 2016 halftime act. Her over-the-top performance included Black Panther clad dancers who proudly displayed the divisive black power fist.The mainstream media ignored her hateful performance. Impressionable young Americans who ve been watching Obama s race war unfold didn t.  Beyonc wasn t promoting the Girl Scouts of America, she was promoting a HATE group who openly vocalizes their desire to KILL COPS! Thanks to Bob Price, we now know the Dallas cop killer was part of that group.Only hours before the Dallas cop killer took the lives of 5 innocent American law enforcement officers, Beyonc posted this rant to her website:Dallas cop killer Micah X. Johnson was a member of the radical, violent Black Panthers, the same group that Beyonce promoted at the 2016 Super Bowl. Our current  President  marched with them in 2007. Obama s AG, Eric Holder gave them a pass, after they were caught in the act of blatantly intimidating voters during the 2008 election. Micah X. Johnson was a member of the Houston New Black Panther Party for a short period of time. He was reported to be a member for about six months a few years ago.Quanell X told reporters at KPRC NBC2 in Houston that Johnson was a member of the Houston Chapter of the New Black Panther Party for a short time a few years ago. He said he parted ways with Johnson after about six months because Johnson would not follow the chain of command.During negotiations with the Dallas Police Department Friday morning during the ambush shooting that left five officers dead and seven other people shot, Johnson said he was not part of any group. He stated he wanted to kill white people and white police officers.WATCH this shocking video showing the Black Panthers (including Dallas cop murderer) openly calling for the killing of cops: Breitbart Texas was present at an armed march carried out by the Houston New Black Panther Party in Waller County last summer. This writer took photos and video of the armed marchers at that time. One of the members holding an AR-15 style rifle appears to be Micah Xavier Johnson.During the march, the armed members of the New Black Panther Party stood off against Harris County Sheriff s Deputies who came to Waller County responding to a request for assistance from Sheriff Glenn Smith.This writer stood between the protesters and the deputies to take these photos and video. Via: Bob Price, Breitbart NewsNot surprisingly, Barack Obama also has a history with the vile, racist Black Panther group. Obama appeared and marched with members of the New Black Panther Party as he campaigned for president in Selma, Ala., in March 2007.BigGovernment.com posted the photographs, reporting the images were captured from a Flickr photo-sharing account before they were scrubbed.Among the people visible in the pictures with Obama is NBPP Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz, a defendant in the voter intimidation case that Attorney General Eric Holder dismissed in 2009.Shabazz himself has given scores of speeches condemning  white men  and Jews.The NBPP s official platform states  white man has kept us deaf, dumb and blind,  refers to the  white racist government of America,  demands black people be exempt from military service and uses the word Jew repeatedly in quotation marks.  WNDIt should come as no surprise to anyone that Beyonc  has endorsed the pandering Hillary Clinton. Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton paid a  surprise visit  to Beyonc  during last week s fundraising trip to Los Angeles. Hillary praised Beyonc  while speaking to a crowd at a town hall in Iowa City, Iowa in December. I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer,  Hillary responded after she was asked if she would rather be Beyonc  or president.  Breitbart NewsThis hateful movement promoted by our President and supported by celebrities and hate groups across America is growing. America needs to wake up to this hate and division and stop supporting those who are working behind the scenes to promote it.

Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) May 9, 2017For those keeping score at home, this is the part in Watergate where Nixon abruptly fired the special prosecutor looking into his crimes and closed down the investigation. The attempt to quash the charges backfired spectacularly, hastening Nixon s ouster. Will Trump s team make the same mistake? Only time will tell.Trump himself made it clear in his letter to Comey that his firing was related to improperly supporting him during public hearings on the FBI investigation into Trump s connections to Russia.

Close followers of NASCAR know Lemonis, CEO of Camping World, is a major player in the sport. His brand is the title sponsor of the truck racing series, while its subsidiary Overton s has sponsored multiple races and cars this season.Amid the flood of CEOs rushing to distance themselves from Trump s business councils after the U.S. president s wishy-washy denunciation of white supremacy last weekend, Lemonis on Wednesday appeared on CNBC s  Power Lunch,  where he seemed to suggest he wouldn t be shattered if people who supported Trump s comments decided to shop elsewhere. Marcus, you have a consumer-facing business, Camping World,  CNBC s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera asked.  So do you worry about, if you were on one of these councils, would you worry, thinking, wow, I ve got to deal with consumers every day, are they going to look at the business poorly because I m associated with the White House?  Lemonis  response:  There s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days   and if they are, frankly, don t shop at my business. Lemonis hasn t been shy about criticizing Trump and NASCAR chairman Brian France   who last year endorsed Donald Trump for president, for their past political views.

17510,JUST IN: DISGRACED DEMOCRAT HARRY REID Funneled MASSIVE Taxpayer Funds To Donor For UFO Research Through SECRET Defense Department Program,"The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.

Last month he also made a change to the Obama administration s policy of prioritizing deportation for convicted criminals, substantially broadening the scope of who the Department of Homeland Security can target, to include those with only minor offenses or those with no convictions at all.Immigration officials confirmed that agents this week raided homes and workplaces in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, the Los Angeles area, North Carolina and South Carolina, netting hundreds of people. But Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said they were part of  routine  immigration enforcement actions. ICE dislikes the term  raids,  and prefers to say authorities are conducting  targeted enforcement actions. Christensen said the raids, which began Monday and ended Friday at noon, found undocumented immigrants from a dozen Latin American countries.  We re talking about people who are threats to public safety or a threat to the integrity of the immigration system,  she said, noting that the majority of those detained were serious criminals, including some who had been convicted of murder and domestic violence.U.S. immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least a half-dozen states this week in a series of raids that marked the first large-scale enforcement of President Trump s Jan. 26 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.The raids, which officials said targeted known criminals, also netted some immigrants who did not have criminal records, an apparent departure from similar enforcement waves during the Obama administration that aimed to just corral and deport those who had committed crimes.Trump has pledged to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos, a former Michigan Republican Party chair, was an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a grade of  F  at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards.

Disloyalty should not be rewarded with a cabinet post,  Braun asserts.  Her lobby group, GLEP, supports common core and P-20 competency based education or so called  school choice.

For some reason   some very, very insane reason   Santorum decided to almost exclusively stump in the pizza chain s locales. By the close of the primary, Santorum had racked up an impressive (or sad, depending on how you look at it) 120 visits, that s nearly two visits per location.CNN s Chris Moody covered the Santorum s Iowa bid, and while he clearly tried to remain objective   and we give them an  A  for effort, really   his recollection of Santorum s sad campaign radiates a sense of bafflement and failure.About forty die-hard Santorumites joined together in a private room at a Pizza Ranch restaurant. The evening was full of nostalgia, sadness and hope, and a pinch of denial, to celebrate a man who hosted more than 700 events in the Hawkeye State. It has been an honor. It really has,  Santorum said.  I hope we have another opportunity, but my guess is that when we come in on Air Force One, we re not going to have these types of deals because we re going to have a country to run. The crowd laughed, lovingly, knowing that what he said wasn t true and probably would never be.There may be nothing more fatalistic than holding what is probably your last campaign rally in the back room of a greasy pizza shop and joking about how someday you may be unable to come in because you re too busy on Air Force One. It s never going to happen   that s the punchline.To twist the knife of failure just a little bit harder, Santorum s Pizza Ranch base of operation is actually already spoken for. The company s CEO, Adrie Groeneweg, announced just weeks ago that he would be endorsing Trump.Groeneweg has never endorsed a candidate before and he has also never caucused.  It was just something my dad has always done,  he explained. This year, Groeneweg said he d go to caucus for Trump in February.Hilariously, Trump didn t even have to show up beforehand. In trademark fashion, Trump only decided he liked Pizza Ranch after he learned the CEO endorsed him.Meanwhile, all the pizza slices in the state couldn t buy Santorum some love.But there is one silverlining to this story. Taking pity on poor Santorum, Pizza Ranch did throw him a bone. They gave him a t-shirt and made him an  honorary employee.

23377,Would a Hillary Clinton Presidency Mean More Wars?,"Special Report: Savvy neocons see Hillary Clinton as their Trojan Horse to be pulled into the White House by Democratic voters, raising the question: would a Clinton-45 presidency mean more wars, asks Robert Parry  Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe Democratic Party establishment seems determined to drag Hillary Clinton s listless campaign across the finish line of her race with Bernie Sanders and then count on Republican divisions to give her a path to the White House. But   if she gets there   the world should hold its breath.If Clinton becomes President, she will be surrounded by a neocon-dominated American foreign policy establishment that will press her to resume its  regime change  strategies in the Middle East and escalate its new and dangerous Cold War against Russia.If Bashar al-Assad is still president of Syria, there will be demands that she finally go for the knock-out blow; there will be pressure, too, for her to ratchet up sanctions on Iran pushing Tehran toward renouncing the nuclear agreement; there are already calls for deploying more U.S. troops on Russia s border and integrating Ukraine into the NATO military structure.President Clinton-45 would hear the clever talking points justifying these moves, the swaggering tough-guy/gal rhetoric, and the tear-jerking propaganda about evil enemies throwing babies off incubators, giving Viagra to soldiers to rape more women, and committing horrific crimes (some real but many imagined) against defenseless innocents.Does anyone think that Hillary Clinton has the wisdom to resist these siren songs of confrontation and war, even if she were inclined to?President Barack Obama, who   for all his faults   has a much deeper and subtler intellect than Hillary Clinton, found himself so battered by these pressures from the militaristic Washington  playbook  that he whined about his predicament to The Atlantic s Jeffrey Goldberg, himself a neocon war hawk.The Washington foreign policy establishment is now so profoundly in the hands of the neocons and their  liberal interventionist  sidekicks that the sitting President presumably couldn t find anyone but a neocon to give those interviews to, even as he complained about how the U.S. capital is in the hands of warmongers.Given this neocon domination of U.S. foreign policy  especially in the State Department bureaucracy, the major media and the big think tanks   Clinton will be buffeted by hawkish demands and plans both from outside of her administration and from within. ARCHTECTS OF WAR: Neocon war hawk and Israeli advocate Robert Kagan and his wife Victoria Nuland are hoping for a Clinton win n November.Already key neocons, such as the Brookings Institution s Robert Kagan, are signaling that they expect to have substantial influence over Clinton s foreign policy. Kagan, who has repackaged himself as a  liberal interventionist, threw his support to Clinton, who put him on a State Department advisory board.There is also talk in Washington that Kagan s neocon wife, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, another Clinton favorite and the architect of the  regime change  in Ukraine, would be in line for a top foreign policy job in a Clinton-45 administration.Neocons Back in ChargeSo, Clinton s election could mean that some of the most dangerous people in American foreign policy would be whispering their schemes for war and more war directly into her ear   and her record shows that she is very susceptible to such guidance.At every turn, as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State, Clinton has opted for  regime change  solutions   from the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the Honduras coup in 2009 to the Libyan air war in 2011 to the Syria civil war since 2011   or she has advocated for the escalation of conflicts, such as in Afghanistan and with Iran, rather than engaging in reasonable give-and-take negotiations.Though her backers tout her experience as Secretary of State, the reality was that she repeatedly disdained genuine diplomacy and was constantly hectoring President Obama into adopting the most violent and confrontational options.He sometimes did (the Afghan  surge,  the Libyan war, the Iran nuclear stand-off) but he sometimes didn t (reversing the Afghan escalation, finally negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran after Clinton left, rejecting a direct U.S. military assault on the Syrian government, and working at times with the Russians on Iran and Syria).In other words, Obama acted as a register or brake restraining Clinton s hawkishness. With Clinton as the President, however, she would have no such restraints. One could expect her to endorse many if not all the harebrained neocon schemes, much as President George W. Bush did when his neocon advisers exploited his fear and fury over 9/11 to guide him into their  regime change  agenda for the Middle East. After Bush s Iraq invasion in 2003, Washington s neocons were joking about whether Iran or Syria should come next, with the punch line:  Real men go to Tehran!  But the Iraq War wasn t the  cakewalk  that the neocons had predicted. Instead of throwing flowers at the U.S. troops, Iraqis planted IEDs Continue this story at Consortium NewsInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

3728, About That Trump University Fine – There’s A Huge Catch; You And I Will Pay It,"After Trump s latest Twitter rant over the performance protest, or rather, polite urging of Mike Pence, the true big story of the day had some daylight, but not near enough. Trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on Saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the Trump University fraud suits. While that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on Sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.To be fair, it s not Trump s fault. It s the fault of the US tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.Of course, the real cost to Mr. Trump is after tax, not before it. And most business settlements are fully tax deductible. The only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. But barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. In general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. Section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. Despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. That allows some flexibility. Companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent Circuit Court ruling. Some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. Conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. Explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.Source: ForbesYes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the Justice Department can enforce. For example, Credit Suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.This all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to Donald Trump s tax returns. He doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.Trump supporters paint him in a passive light. After all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. The fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades. That s why they are able to pay far less, as a percentage of income, than most Americans.If you expect this will get better with Trump in office, let s hope you re not holding your breath. Trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes. Of course, he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic. Analysts have already figured out that Trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy, and only the wealthy, all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"November 20, 2016",trump twitter rant performance protest urging mike pence story day daylight trump trump university fraud bit justice bill fault fault tax code wealthy people lawsuit course cost trump tax business tax part government section tax code penalty government violation law sounding flexibility maneuver circuit court settlement agreement government reverse explicit settlement source tax code justice department example credit fine tax evasion fact access tax pay fact year dollar loss trump light fault tax code wealthy fact people tax percentage income trump office let breath trump week restaurant people course trump tax plan wealthy country debt image chip

22450,SPECTRE OF BENGHAZI: DOJ Drops Charges Against Alleged Arms Dealer of Libyan Weapons,"21st Century Wire says The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is dropping all charges against an arms dealer whose weapons made it into the hands of radical Libya militants.Early this week a motion was filed by the DOJ to drop charges against an American arms dealer named Marc Turi, according to federal court records obtained by Politico.Also according to Politico: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.   LIBYA FALLOUT    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)In the book entitled Definitive Report by both Jack Murphy (Army Green Beret) and Brandon Webb (Navy SEAL), a close friend of Glen Doherty (one of the Americans killed during the Benghazi siege) it was revealed that Obama s former deputy NSA advisor and current CIA director, John Brennan had been directing covert black-ops in Libya as well as other parts in North Africa, prior to the siege that left four Americans dead at a compound in Benghazi.Brennan s covert operations were said to have  prompted retaliation  inside the compound in Libya   as former CIA director David Petraeus had been blackmailed into resignation by senior CIA officials.All of this information was preceded by a massive cover-up involving mainstream media, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Susan Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both of whom initially blamed the siege on a heavily propagandized YouTube film entitled,  The Innocence of Muslims.  This meme was spread on many major talk shows even though evidence failed to connect the film to the attack.In addition, the White House and President Barack Obama had many inconsistencies in their talking points about Benghazi, first labeling it a terror attack, then quickly shifting gears, denying that there were Al Qaeda operatives anywhere near the compound.US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was said to have helped manage a large gun-running operation from the  Special Mission Compound  in Benghazi, as he was also said to have helped ship guns to  al-Qaeda-linked opposition  to assist in the takedown of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.In a Business Insider report from October of 2012, the Benghazi story dovetailed the growing proxy war in Syria: In March 2011 Stevens became the official U.S. liaison to the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan opposition, working directly with Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group   a group that has now disbanded, with some fighters reportedly participating in the attack that took Stevens  life.In November 2011 The Telegraph reported that Belhadj, acting as head of the Tripoli Military Council,  met with Free Syrian Army [FSA] leaders in Istanbul and on the border with Turkey  in an effort by the new Libyan government to provide money and weapons to the growing insurgency in Syria. As 21WIRE has previously reported in 2014,  It s worth noting here: like Libya s new militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, the Chechen terrorist group Kata ib Mohadzherin s leader Airat Vakhitov was also under US supervision for years  imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circa 2002, after being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Both were Belhadj and Vakhitov were released by the Pentagon only to be repatriated in the field again   back into fighting regions to organise al Qaeda-type Islamist groups   both active in countries which the US and NATO have been actively vying for regime change   in Libya and Syria, respectively. You can draw your own conclusions here about what Guantanamo is in reality, a fact which was confirmed by thePenny Lane leaks regarding the recruitment of double agents out of Gitmo. Interestingly, in a NY Times article from December of 2012 entitled, U.S.-Approved Arms for Libya Rebels Fell Into Jihadis  Hands,  we see an acknowledgement of an arms shipment at the behest of the Obama administration under the watchful eye of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   but the mainstream media appears to have provided cover for the White House and State Department by blaming Qatar for the weapons transfer to militants: The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats.No evidence has emerged linking the weapons provided by the Qataris during the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to the attack that killed four Americans at the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in September.But in the months before, the Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants, concerns that have not previously been reported. The weapons and money from Qatar strengthened militant groups in Libya, allowing them to become a destabilizing force since the fall of the Qaddafi government. The spectre of Benghazi looms large when connecting the Middle Eastern dots over the past five years.More from Zero Hedge below   TRAIL OF BLOOD    Many questions about 2012 s Benghazi terror siege remain unanswered. (Image Source: foxnews)DOJ Drops Charges Against Arms Dealer Who  Threatened To Expose  Hillary Arming Islamic ExtremistsZero HedgeIn what would under other circumstances likely be a major media spectacle, Politico reported that the Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer whom it had accused of selling weapons destined for Libyan rebels and who had threatened to expose Hillary Clinton s talks about arming anti-Qaddafi rebels.According to a motion filed in federal court in Phoenix, the DOJ on Monday filed a motion to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi. One potential reason for the surprising move is that as Politico writes, the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Turi was indicted in 2014 on four felony counts: two of arms dealing in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and two of lying to the State Department in official applications. The charges accused Turi of claiming that the weapons involved were destined for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, when the arms were actually intended to reach Libya. Turi s lawyers argued that the shipments were part of a U.S. government-authorized effort to arm Libyan rebels. It s unclear if any of the weapons made it to Libya, and there s no evidence linking weapons provided by the U.S. government to the Benghazi attacks.According to Politico government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants.Making matters worse, Turi s case had delved into emails sent to and from the controversial private account that Clinton used as Secretary of State, which the defense planned to harness at any trial. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,  said the associate.Leery of admitting the actual truth, in the dismissal motion, prosecutors were vague saying that  discovery rulings  from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker.This story continues at Zero Hedge READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files   READ MORE LIBYA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Libya FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 5, 2016",century wire department justice dealer week motion arms dealer marc court politico deal trial scrutiny secretary state intelligence agency leader photo illustration book report jack murphy army beret seal friend siege deputy advisor director prior siege compound retaliation compound director resignation information cover media assistant secretary state rice secretary state siege film innocence talk evidence film attack addition house president terror attack compound gun operation mission compound opposition takedown dictator business insider report story war march liaison al opposition group group attack life telegraph head council army border turkey effort government money insurgency governor hakim group leader supervision bay circa pentagon field type regime change reality fact lane recruitment times article arms shipment behest administration eye secretary state media cover house state department administration blessing arms year evidence evidence uprising col el attack compound administration hand arm money force fall government hedge trail blood terror siege image source arms dealer media spectacle politico administration arms dealer motion court phoenix motion case arms dealer marc reason move politico deal trial scrutiny secretary state intelligence agency leader felony arms violation arms export control act state department arms part government effort evidence government government deadline team trial election day information case associate government case president attention role administration extremist case sent account secretary state defense trial stuff election leery truth dismissal motion discovery district court judge decision case motion judge agreement case settlement state department arms broker story hedge news century wire news century wire work member
20947,CONGRESS JUST DEALT A BIG BLOW To Obama And His Favorite Terror Group [VIDEO],"Obama has shown favoritism towards the Muslim Brotherhood terror group almost since the first day of his presidency. Many are convinced Obama is tied to the terror group through his brother, and his desire to prevent Americans from referring to this group as a  terror group  doesn t do much to convince us he doesn t have some sort of ties to them. Obama quietly offered his support when the riots Arab Spring uprisings took place in Egypt, paving the way for the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist, Mohamed Morsy to take over as President of Egypt through  fair  elections The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill on Wednesday calling on the State Department to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, by a 17-10 party-line vote.The GOP leadership under Speaker Paul Ryan supports the legislation, a high-ranking Republican source told the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) on background. This makes floor passage more likely.The bill states that it is the  sense of Congress that the Muslim Brotherhood meets the criteria for classification as a foreign terrorist organization. Under the bill as amended by committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Secretary of State John Kerry would have 60 days to issue a detailed report to Congress indicating whether the Brotherhood meets the criteria qualifying it as a terrorist group. The Brotherhood s strategic goal in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house from within so that it is eliminated and God s religion is made victorious over all other religions,  Goodlatte said, quoting the Brotherhood s 1991 Explanatory Memorandum, in a statement given before the vote.Here is Muslim terror expert, Brigitte Gabriel explaining the plan by the Muslim Brotherhood to jihad in North America. After watching this, you may ask yourself what has taken Congress so long to act? The Brotherhood and its leaders and affiliates, such as Hamas, have supported Islamist terrorism   directly, through fundraising, and through exhortation. Each of these activities constitutes an act of terrorism under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the bill, the Obama Administration would be forced to deny admittance to any foreign national tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.Since Obama became President, people connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have received entry visas despite their open support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.There are many who believe the Muslim Brotherhood has been given special treatment by our very own  President,  and that he is somehow tied to the group:HERE, Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) is asking why the Obama regime gave $1.5 BILLION to the Muslim Brotherhood:Previously banned individuals such as Sheikh Rached Ghannouchi, head of Tunisia s branch of the Brotherhood, and Tariq Ramadan, grandson of Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, have been welcomed to the US by the Obama Administration despite their vocal support for Hamas. Ramadan fought his ban on entering the US in court, and won an appeal.Other foreign Brotherhood speakers such as Ragheb Elsergany exploit the platform given to them by the Obama Administration to advocate for Muslims to support Palestinian  mujahideen  fighting against Israel.If the Brotherhood were designated as a terrorist group, it would be a crime for people in the United Sates to provide material support to it, and the Treasury Department could force banks to block financial transactions related to the Brotherhood. The bill lists US groups, including the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as groups under the control of the international Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood continues to pose a global threat. The jihadist movement actively supports and finances terrorist networks around the world, including al-Qaida and Hamas. The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy,  co-sponsor Rep.

6850, Trump Is Now Officially Increasing The Chance Of A Nuclear Incident According To This Report,"Republicans aren t very smart about a lot of things, but one of their most unfortunate mental deficits is in their awareness of what they sound like to the rest of the world. Whether they simply are too dumb to know, or they just don t care, the way they portray America to the rest of the world is a damned embarrassment to the nation.One of the worst sources of this global shame is easily Donald Trump, for obvious reasons. His stupidity, empty talk, hate and chest beating are dragging us back to pre-Obama levels of global ridicule. However, now things are taking a departure from simple mockery and turning into a serious international incident.North Korea is now using Trump s rhetoric regarding nuclear proliferation, and the fact thath e is actually advocating using them, as justification for not backing down on their nuclear program. This is the same North Korea that only about a month ago wanted to have their nuclear weapons ready to fire at a moment s notice, and promised to expand their arsenal.Ri Jong Ryul, deputy-director general of the Institute of International Studies in Pyongyang had this to say: Donald Trump s remarks are totally absurd and illogical. The U.S. tells us to give up our nuclear program, is preparing a nuclear attack against us, and on the other hand would tell its allies to have nuclear weapons. Isn t this (a) double standard? Source: CNNNorth Korea was difficult enough to deal with on their best days. Now, they hear a person that could be the Presidential nominee of the most war-loving political party in modern American history advocating for more nuclear weapons to be developed, as well as the actual use of them against nations like North Korea. Perhaps one day Republicans will understand that people outside of the U.S. also do listen to our politics, but sadly that doesn t seem to be today.Featured image via Mother Jones",News,"April 17, 2016",lot awareness rest world care way rest world embarrassment nation shame trump stupidity talk hate chest beating ridicule departure mockery north trump rhetoric proliferation fact justification program month moment notice deputy director general institute trump program attack hand allies standard source days person nominee war party history use day people politics today image mother
7930, FIVE Federal Judges Admit That California Is About To Execute ‘An Innocent Man’,"Thirty years ago, the state of California sentenced Kevin Cooper to death. In 2004, his life was spared just hours before he was supposed to be executed. But now, more than a decade later, in a matter of weeks,  he is once again facing lethal injection and even a federal judge agrees that he may be innocent.In 1983, Cooper escaped a maximum security prison and was holed up in an abandoned house hiding from authorities. While he was hiding out in the house, two adults and two small children, just a short distance away in the Chino Hills suburb of Los Angeles were being murdered. When police found the bodies of Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica, and 10-year-old Chris Hughes they zeroed in on Cooper as the suspect. He was eventually convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that he did not commit the murders.There was one survivor, a then 8-year-old Josh Ryen who had his throat cut and was left for dead. When Josh Ryen recovered from his injuries, he stated that it was three white or Hispanic men that attacked and killed his family and that Cooper was not involved. This started a chain of events that reveal a 30 year cover up and blatant falsification of evidence by police and the prosecutor s office in San Bernadino County.In addition to the child s statement (which he later changed), there was another suspect. When the Ryens were murdered, their station wagon was stolen and witnesses reported that they d seen three men in a vehicle matching its description near the crime. Furthermore, the ex-wife of a white supremacist (Lee Furrow) told the police that her ex had come home wearing bloody pants after the murder. She also said that a hatchet was missing from her home. She gave the police the pants and they never tested them for DNA. Finally, police also found the blood of two other people who did not match Cooper or the victims at the crime scene.Cooper appealed his conviction and although the Ninth Circuit Court upheld the conviction, five federal judges wrote a 103-page dissent, saying: There is no way to say this politely. The district court failed to provide Cooper a fair hearing. The district court impeded and obstructed Cooper s attorneys at every turn. [T]he court imposed unreasonable conditions, refused discovery that should have been available as a matter of course; limited testimony that should not have been limited; and found facts unreasonably, based on a truncated and distorted record. Public confidence in the proper administration of the death penalty depends on the integrity of the process followed by the state  So far as due process is concerned, twenty-four years of flawed proceedings are as good as no proceedings at all. the State of California may be about to execute an innocent man. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case and that means that his conviction has been upheld. Now, Cooper is just weeks away from execution, he will be the first person in the state to be executed in the state since 2006 if Governor Jerry Brown does not grant him a stay.It is unprecedented to have five federal judges warn that an innocent man may be executed. Frankly, in a case like this that should be all that is needed for a new trial, at the very least.The death penalty is controversial in this country. It is one of those things that even liberals are split on.

9569,REPUBLICANS CALL FOR ANSWERS: Did Wasserman-Schultz and Podesta Just Get Caught In A Big Lie?,"Busted! Even moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine said it best when she questioned how Wasserman-Schultz wouldn t know of the payment to Fusion GPS: It s difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance. She and John Podesta testified last month that they knew nothing of the payment for a dossier on Trump Oops! Now, Republicans want answers:Congressional Republicans on Sunday called for Democrats John Podesta and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to provide further answers about their party paying for a dossier on President Trump s alleged ties to Russia, after telling Senate investigators last month that they had no knowledge of such payments.Wasserman Schultz is the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign. Both groups purportedly paid millions for research that led to the dossier, The Washington Post reported last week.Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggested on  Fox News Sunday  that the DNC paying a law firm for so-called opposition research connected to the dossier was tantamount to money laundering. I m not an election law expert, but the good news is you don t have to be, to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm,  said Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor.  So I m interested in that. He also seemed to question Podesta and Wasserman Schultz telling the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that they didn t know who paid for the dossier. I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid $10 million to a law firm to do oppo research,  Gowdy said.  I find that stunning. $10 million and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it, who said,  This is a really good idea. When questioned about the issue by Fox News last week on Capitol Hill, Wasserman Schultz said only:  I wasn t aware of the arrangement at all.

169, Attempts By Trump To Pardon Anyone Indicted By Mueller Could Backfire On Him In A BIG Way,"There s a lot of talk that, if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal, Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished, least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 29, 2017",lot talk trump russia scandal trump nobody trump pardon guilt bus water power news president power absolute people president people effort justice effort president conduct thing counsel trump justice constitution president power precedent president people campaign trump part tweeter chief twitter something rant one something anyone pardon admission guilt people trump truth exchange sentence man house russia distraction nothing image
16852,"Dear Liberal, Why I’m So Hostile…And How “Your political beliefs are a threat to liberty – not just for me, but for my three boys”","WOW! This is a powerful, must read letter that should be shared with every American Lately, I must admit that my hostility towards your political ilk has ramped up, pretty dramatically. No, it s not because we, at this point in my life, have a half-black president in the White House, and I m some closet racist who is becoming increasingly frustrated at the prospects of the White Man s power slipping through my fingers. I know that you ve accused our side of such nonsense, and the thought keeps you warm at night, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable fiction of which you should probably divest yourself.Now before I waste too much of your time, let s establish who I m talking to. If you believe that we live in an evil, imperialist nation from its founding, and you believe that it should be  fundamentally transformed , lend me your ears. If you believe that the free market is the source of the vast majority of society s ills and wish to have more government intervention into it, I m talking to you. If you believe that health care is a basic human right and that government should provide it to everyone, you re the guy I m screaming at. If you think minorities cannot possibly survive in this inherently racist country without handouts and government mandated diversity quotas, you re my guy. If you believe that rich people are that way because they ve exploited their workers and acquired wealth on the backs of the poor, keep reading. Pretty much, if you trust government more than your fellow American, this post is for you.First of all, let me say that we probably agree on more things than you think. Even between Tea Party Patriots and Occupy Wall-Streeters, I ve observed a common hatred of the insidious alliance between big business and big government. As Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) so correctly noted, government should never be in the business of picking winners and losers in corporate America, and no person, organization, union, or corporation should have their own key to the back door of our government.Second, contrary to popular belief, conservatives really are concerned with the plight of the poor in this nation. You accuse us of being uncompassionate, hateful, racist, and greedy, but studies have shown that when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives are at least (if not more, depending on the study you read) as generous as liberals in caring for the poor. The difference between us is not in our attitude towards the problem   it s our attitude towards the solution. We believe that the government does practically nothing well (since without competition or a profit motive there is no incentive to do well) and has made the plight of the poor far worse than it would have ever been had government never gotten involved. For a stark example of this, look no farther than the condition of the black family in America since the  War on Poverty  began. You believe that more government is the answer, and that if we only throw more money at the problem, the problem will go away. We believe, as Reagan so aptly stated,Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.Third, as people who might actually have to avail ourselves of a doctor s services at some point in our lives, we are just as concerned with the condition of America s healthcare system as you are. While we believe that America has the world s most capable physicians, has the world s most innovative pharmaceutical industry, and is on the cutting edge of medical technology, we also understand that the delivery system is far from perfect. However, unlike you, we see a grave danger in turning the administration of that delivery system over to the same entity that is responsible for giving us the United States Postal Service. There are private sector solutions that should certainly be explored before we kill the system, altogether, by giving it to the government to run.Now that we ve touched on a couple of points of common ground, allow me to explain my aggressiveness towards your efforts to implement your progressive agenda. First, let s talk about the word  progressive , since you now seem to prefer that word to  liberal . In order to label something as progressive or regressive, one must have some idea as to what constitutes progress. What is the ideal towards which you are striving? An idea is considered progressive if it moves us closer to the ideal and regressive if it moves us further away. So, what is your ideal society?Though I can t begin to discern the thoughts of every liberal who may read this, nor can I assume that every liberal has the same notion of an ideal society, in my arguments with liberals over the years, I couldn t help but notice the influence that FDR s Second Bill of Rights has had in shaping the beliefs of the modern liberal with regards to domestic policy. The rights that FDR cited are: The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education.At this point, you re probably screaming,  Right on!! , and who can blame you? What sane person in the world doesn t want everyone to be gainfully employed, adequately fed, smartly clothed, appropriately sheltered, and properly educated? These are the goals of every moral society on the planet, however we cannot ignore the fundamental question of,  At what cost? I m not sure whether FDR was a shallow thinker or simply a shrewd, Machiavellian politician, but the fact that he framed each of these ideals as a human right should be troubling to every freedom-loving person in America. After all, what does it mean for something to be a human right? Doesn t it mean that it s something to which you are entitled simply by virtue of your being human? Let s think about some of the basic rights that the real Bill of Rights delineates: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the government, freedom to bear arms, freedom from illegal search and seizure, etc.If you re moderately intelligent and intellectually honest, you ll quickly see what separates the rights laid out in the real Bill of Rights from those laid out in FDR s misguided list   none of the rights listed above require the time, treasure, or talents of another human being.Your right to speak requires nothing from anyone else. Your right to practice your religion requires nothing from any of your fellow citizens. Your right to bear arms means that you are allowed to possess weapons to defend yourself and your family, but it makes no demand that a weapon be provided to you by anyone. A true human right is one that you possess, even if you re the only person on the entire planet   and it is unconditional.FDR s list is no  Bill of Rights . It s a list of demands. If I have a right to a job, doesn t that mean that one must be provided to me? If I have a right to adequate food, clothing, and recreation, doesn t that mean that I am entitled to those things, and someone should provide them to me? If I have an inherent right to a decent home, once again, doesn t that mean it should be provided to me, regardless of my ability to afford one or build one for myself?You might protest that FDR only meant that we have the right to pursue those things, but that s not what he said, and why would he? If we live in a free society, our right to pursue those things is self-evident, is it not? Besides, if he only believed in our right to pursue those things, he would not have felt the need to implement the New Deal.You may be getting anxious, now, wondering what FDR s Second Bill of Rights has to do with my antipathy towards your political philosophy. It s quite simple   your political beliefs are a threat to liberty   not just for me, but for my three boys and their children as well. I care much less about the America that I m living in at this very moment than I do about the one that I m leaving Nathaniel, Charlie, and Jackson.How does your political bent threaten my and my sons personal liberty, you ask? In your irrational attempt to classify things such as clothing, shelter, health care, employment, and income as basic human rights, you are placing a demand upon my time, my treasure, and my talents. If you believe that you have a right to health care, and you are successful in persuading enough shallow thinkers to think as you do, then it will place a demand upon me to provide it to you. If you believe that you have a right to a job, and more than half of America agrees with you, as a business owner, I am obligated to provide one to you, even if it means making my business less profitable.The fact is, you can rail against my conservatism all you wish. You can make fun of my Tea Party gatherings, and you can ridicule patriots in tri-corner hats until you wet yourself from mirth, but one thing is for certain: my political philosophy will NEVER be a threat to your freedom. If you feel a burning responsibility to the poor, conservatism will never prevent you from working 80 hours per week and donating all of your income to charity. If you feel a strong sense of pity for a family who cannot afford health insurance, my political philosophy will never prevent you from purchasing health insurance for this family or raising money to do so, if you cannot afford it, personally. If you are moved with compassion for a family who is homeless, a conservative will never use the police power of government to prevent you from taking that family in to your own home or mobilizing your community to build one for them.However, you cannot say the same for liberalism. If I choose not to give to the poor for whatever reason, you won t simply try to persuade me on the merits of the idea   you will seek to use the government as an instrument of plunder to force me to give to the poor. If we are walking down the street together and we spot a homeless person, using this logic, you would not simply be content with giving him $20 from your own pocket   you would hold a gun to my head and force me to give him $20, as well.Everything that modern liberalism accomplishes is accomplished at the barrel of a government rifle. You do not trust in the generosity of the American people to provide, through private charity, things such as clothing, food, shelter, and health care, so you empower the government to take from them and spend the money on wasteful, inefficient, and inadequate government entitlement programs. You do not trust in the personal responsibility of the average American to wield firearms in defense of themselves and their families, so you seek to empower the government to criminalize the use and possession of firearms by private citizens. Everytime you empower the government, you lose more of your personal liberty   it s an axiomatic truth.What angers me the most about you is the eagerness with which you allow the incremental enslavement to occur. You are the cliched and proverbial frog in the pot who has actually convinced himself that he s discovered a big, silver jacuzzi. Somehow, you re naive enough to believe that one more degree of heat won t really matter that much.I have the utmost respect for a slave who is continuously seeking a path to freedom. What I cannot stomach is a free man who is continuous seeking a path to servitude by willingly trading his freedom for the false sense of security that government will provide.I am reminded of Samuel Adams  impassioned speech where he stated: If ye love wealth (or security) better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom,   go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!  Servitude can exist in a free society, but freedom cannot exist in a slave nation. In a free country, you have the liberty to join with others of your political ilk and realize whatever collectivist ideals you can dream up. You can start your own little commune where the sign at the front gate says,  From each according to his ability; to each according to his need , and everyone can work for the mutual benefit of everyone else. In my society, you have the freedom to do that.In your society, I don t have the same freedom. If your collectivism offends me, I am not free to start my own free society within its borders. In order for collectivism to work, everyone must be on board, even those who oppose it   why do you think there was a Berlin Wall?In conclusion, just know that the harder you push to enact your agenda, the more hostile I will become   the harder I will fight you. It s nothing personal, necessarily. If you want to become a slave to an all-powerful central government, be my guest. But if you are planning to take me and my family down with you, as we say down here in the South, I will stomp a mud-hole in your chest and walk it dry.Bring it.Jeremy N.

It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs, according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves, as officials had promised.Nearly $1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program, which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved, totaling nearly about $30 billion in taxpayer backing, the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates, which found the government was poised to face $4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees. But as the projects have come to fruition, they ve performed better, leaving taxpayers with a shrinking   though still sizable   liability. As of November 2014, DOE estimates the credit subsidy cost of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio   that is, the total expected net cost over the life of the loans   to be $2.21 billion, including $807 million for loans that have defaulted,  the GAO said in its report to Congress.The green program loan guarantees were created in a 2005 law and boosted by the 2009 stimulus. The first applications were approved in 2009, and through 2014 the Obama administration had issued some 38 loans and guarantees, covering 34 projects ranging from nuclear power plants to fuel-efficient vehicles to solar panels and wind-generation technology.Read more: Washington Times",left-news,"Apr 28, 2015",hook energy scam millions toilet hook government energy loan guarantee audit energy department program stimulus project technology administration taxpayer government accountability office audit price tag improvement government loan fruition shrinking liability doe credit subsidy cost loan portfolio net cost life report program loan law stimulus administration power generation technology times

Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote.

14315,HOW REAGAN DEALT WITH RADICAL PROTESTERS At Berkeley University [VIDEO],"Reagan explains why the protesters got out of hand to the reporters:  All of it began the first time some of you who know better and are old enough to know better, let young people think that they had the right to chose the the laws they would obey, as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest. Compare and contrast Reagan s decision to address the unlawful behavior of these protesters, to Barack Obama hiding from the press, yet meeting with organizers and agitators of these radical groups to offer encouragment to the violent, unlawful protesters we are seeing across the United States today.Do you agree or disagree with Reagan s approach to stopping the protesters from breaking the law: In his 1966 campaign for California governor, Republican Ronald Reagan promised to  to clean up the mess at Berkeley.  Reagan was referring to the unrest prevalent not just at the University of California, Berkeley, but on college campuses throughout state. Students and faculty alike were engaged in protests, demonstrations, and strikes related to issues such as the draft, civil rights, discrimination, and women s liberation.In one 1966 campaign speech, Reagan declared that many leftist campus movements had transcended legitimate protest, with the actions of  beatniks, radi cals and filthy speech advocates  having become more to do  with riot ing, with anarchy  than  academic freedom.  He blamed university administrators and faculty, who  press their particular value judgments  on students, for  a leadership gap and a morality and decency gap  on campus, and suggested a code of conduct be imposed on faculty to  force them to serve as examples of good behavior and decency. [1]Six months after Reagan took office in 1967, he wrote this letter to Glenn Dumke, the chancellor of San Francisco State College, one of California s largest public institutions. Dumke served as the public face of the state college system, and he was a staunch opponent of radical student and faculty demonstrations. In his letter to Dumke, Reagan criticizes liberal activism on campuses. He condemns  these people & this trash  on campuses as well as  the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression  in allowing protests and demonstrations to go on.  We wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families,  Reagan writes of campus protesters. He urges Dumke to  lay down some rules of conduct,  promising that  you d have all the backing I could give you. How far do we go in tolerating these people & this trash under the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression? Please understand, that question isn t made in any tone of accusation. I mean myself too in that use of the term  we. We wouldn t let a LeRoi Jones in our livingroom and we wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families. Hasn t the time come to take on those neurotics in our faculty group and lay down some rules of conduct for the students comparable to what we d expect in our own families? If we do and the  we  this time means you d have all the backing I could give you, I believe the people of Calif. would take the state college system to their hearts.[illegible] RonVia: The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History",politics,"Mar 12, 2016",hand time people right name protest compare contrast decision behavior press violent today approach law campaign governor mess prevalent university college state faculty draft discrimination liberation campaign speech campus protest speech riot anarchy freedom university faculty value leadership gap morality decency gap campus code conduct faculty behavior decency office letter chancellor state college face state college system opponent student faculty letter activism people trash excuse freedom freedom expression tolerate kind language front campus conduct promising backing people trash excuse freedom freedom expression please question tone accusation use term tolerate kind language front time faculty group conduct time backing people state college system hearts gilder institute history
18309,OOPS! MIT Researchers Debunk Global Warming Data…Report Confirms President Trump Was Right To Pull Out Of Paris Climate Agreement,"B b..but Al Gore and Barack Obama say Scientists  were exposed for manipulating climate data during the 2011 Climategate  scandal when 5,000 emails were released from scientists proving that the science behind their studies is inconclusive and mostly a result of manipulating climate data to fit the political message they were trying to convey.Three themes emerged from the emails that were released in the Climategate scandal: (1) prominent scientists central to the global warming debate are taking measures to conceal rather than disseminate underlying data and discussions; (2) these scientists view global warming as a political  cause  rather than a balanced scientific inquiry and (3) many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data.  ForbesA new report on global warming data has now proven President Donald Trump to be right to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The report analyzed climate data such as Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY.SHFTPLan reports: According to the report, which has been peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America s leading universities, the data is completely bunk: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU.As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data.The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever  despite current claims of record setting warming.Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPA s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Fox News reported on President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement per his campaign promise: he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.It is the right decision for a number of reasons.First, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.Second, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.Third, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate. Members of the liberal establishment were outraged.Obama criticized President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement with the following statement : A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar   industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is  do as I say, not as I do,  with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obama s massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan?The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the  Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit  in the city of Milan.It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio s book of  do as I say, not as I do  and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter.It doesn t end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president.The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans   not to mention a few motorcycles. Here s another look at the convoy:While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.

5932, These Two Former Republicans Are On The Cusp Of Making History – As Democrats,"All the political buzz right now is whether or not Elizabeth Warren will be Hillary Clinton s vice presidential nominee. The once neutral Massachusetts Senator has now passionately endorsed Clinton to be the Democratic Party s nominee for President of the United States, and women s groups are ecstatic at the thought of a two women ticket.But what s more significant isn t that a Clinton-Warren ticket would be comprised of two women, it s that it would be comprised of two former Republicans coming together to usher in one of the most progressive party platforms this country has ever seen.Clinton, who was a Goldwater girl and a Republican until 1968, and Warren, a Republican until 1996, both had their reasons for leaving the GOP and joining the progressive movement. Clinton let over her opposition to the Vietnam War, and the party s veiled racist messages at the 1968 Republican National Convention (these veiled racist messages would later be known as the Southern Strategy).Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, who is roughly the same age as Clinton, stayed in the GOP for a lot longer, but realized (coincidentally, during the Clinton Administration) that they were nothing but a bunch of frauds suckling at the teat of big money: I was an independent. I was with the GOP for a while because I really thought that it was a party that was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets. And I feel like the GOP party just left that. They moved to a party that said,  No, it s not about a level playing field. It s now about a field that s gotten tilted.  And they really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle class American families. I just feel like that s a party that moved way, way away. Two iconic, liberal women. Both former Republicans. Now? They may be the next President and Vice President of the United States.Compared to Warren (and indeed Sanders), Clinton is certainly the more moderate one. But that doesn t mean she isn t a progressive in her own right, fighting for the rights of women and children for decades and standing up to lobbies that want to turn back the clocks. Clinton s compassion for working families, coupled with Warren s watchdog zeal for the big banks, seems to make us forget they started with conservative backgrounds.It s interesting how that works. From humble, conservative backgrounds to being the front page news on the cusp of history   as Democrats.Some conservatives cow tow to the elites, like the so called  Reagan Democrats,  and others wake up one day, look around, and realize that the system isn t working anymore. So they become Democrats, and fight to make the country a better place.While the Democrats have (hopefully) chosen an evolved ticket, Republicans have nominated a constant flip flopper; Trump was a Democrat before 1987; Republican from 1987 to 1999; Reform from 1999 to 2001; Democrat again from 2001 to 2009; Republican again from 2009 to 2011; Independent from 2011 to 2012; and is now a Republican, again.These two ladies had what s called a natural progression. Trump? He s seen opportunities to benefit him and only him.With Warren and Clinton, America gets exactly what they see. With Trump, who knows. But what we do know is this: Clinton   Warren chose to become Democrats, and have stuck by that principle for decades. And they may very well be our next President and Vice President.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 10, 2016",buzz warren vice senator party nominee president thought ticket warren ticket party country goldwater girl movement let opposition war party racist convention racist strategy warren hand age lot administration nothing bunch suckling teat money party approach economics party party field field class party way way president vice president warren sanders mean progressive right compassion warren zeal front page news cusp history tow day system fight country place ticket flip flopper trump democrat republican reform democrat republican ladies progression trump warren trump principle president vice president image mark
6670," Israeli PM Rejects Obama’s $40 Billion Aid Offer, Demands More While America’s Children Go Hungry","The state of Israel currently receives a staggering $3 billion a year in so-called aid, much of it for its military, which is then used to brutalize the Palestinian people in the form of a military occupation and a settlement apparatus of land theft that is illegal under international law. With the current agreement set to expire in 2017, Israel wants a raise. They are now asking for an estimated $5 billion a year over the next ten years, for a total of more than $50 billion.Despite the fact that we can use this money at home to help America s 16 million children who live below the poverty level, Israel s prime minister not only is asking for more money, but he had the nerve to reject President Obama s offer of $40 billion over the next ten years. Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis are using their pull in Washington to get the POTUS to play by their rules. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a lobby group in Washington that works on behalf of a foreign country (Israel) often through the coercion and arm twisting of American officials, just got 83 U.S. senators to sign a letter demanding that the president send money to Israel. The letter states: In light of Israel s dramatically rising defense challenges, we stand ready to support a substantially enhanced new long-term agreement to help provide Israel the resources it requires to defend itself and preserve its qualitative military edge. Not surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders was not one of the signatories to the letter. The senator has recognized not only that Israel uses disproportionate force on Palestinian civilians through weapons the U.S. gives to Israel, but he also knows the alarming poverty rate that exists in our own backyard with a staggering number of children living in food insecure homes: Another element to this insane demand for money from a country supposedly in need is that Israelis enjoy free universal healthcare and education. American households incur billions in debt just so their children can be able to go to school. Moreover, many Americans continue to have no access to healthcare and Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare.It s time for America to take care of its children, its sick, and its hungry. It s time for America s politicians to worry about America first instead of an ungrateful country that doesn t require aid but rather needs to be stopped and sanctioned for its brutality against the Palestinian people.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons ",News,"April 27, 2016",state year aid much people form occupation settlement apparatus land theft law agreement set raise year ten total fact money home poverty level minister money nerve president offer ten pull committee lobby group behalf country coercion arm twisting letter president money letter light defense term agreement edge sanders letter senator force poverty rate number food insecure element demand money country need universal education debt school access time care sick time country require aid brutality people image commons

9851,The View Host Furious…Drops Bombshell On Being Let Go," BLINDSIDED    THE CURIOUS REASON THE NETWORK LET BILA GO OR SO THEY SAYEveryone was caught off guard on Monday when The View co-host Jedediah Bila announced live that she was departing the show and it would be her last day on air. The 38-year-old political pundit joined the show as a permanent co-host in 2016 after serving as a guest host several times in 2015. Bila revealed in her exit speech that she was preparing to write a not-yet-titled book that will be released next year, but offered no other plans or explanation for her abrupt departure from the show. DailyMail.com has now exclusively learned that Bila was blindsided by the shakeup the weekend before her shock announcement, as it is revealed that Meghan McCain is in talks to take her spot.CNN TIP OFFThe former Fox News contributor received a call from a friend at CNN who tipped her off that ABC News had done a deal with conservative host McCain to replace her.  After she heard, Jedediah called the execs at ABC and they were basically like,  Oops, you weren t supposed to find out this way.  She went from being initially shocked to furious that they would treat her this way,  a source at the network told DailyMail.com.SHE S NOT A REPUBLICAN The network s reasoning for wanting to ditch Bila was because even though she played the role of the conservative on the show, she isn t an actual Republican. Bila is a registered independent voter who did not support Donald Trump and identifies herself as a Libertarian.HILLARY S FAULT?Bila griped to staffers on Monday that she felt this was all fallout from her Hillary Clinton interview.

Emmy Award-winning Patricia Heaton served as the event s first-ever woman emcee.Ryan hit at President Trump several times during his speech: I m learning being Speaker of the House is a stepping stone to becoming ex-Speaker of the House.

He famously said during the 2016 campaign that he would fight against Trump s agenda:The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally. For entire story- Matthew Boyle, Breitbart NewsLISTEN:Globalist RINOs like Paul Ryan hate Trump s agenda because it focuses on the American people 100%. Ryan has famously supported cheap foreign labor that kills American jobs and has expressed his dislike for Trump s wall that would prevent the flood of illegals we have now.

1219," Republicans Dine With Trump, Then Try To Railroad Comey Into Clearing Him (VIDEO)","Republicans are once again putting their party before their country. Just before the highly anticipated testimony from fired FBI Director James Comey, GOP Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Tom Cotton (R-AL) went scurrying down to the White House like good little Republican sycophants to have dinner with Donald Trump.Nevermind the optics of this, nevermind the fact that it is at best highly inappropriate to put themselves into a situation where Trump might try to lean on them to go in a certain direction with their questioning of Comey   none of that mattered to these two sniveling weasels. All they cared about was currying favor with their so-called  president,  and trying to cast him in as decent a light as possible.These slimy tactics showed in their lines of questioning of Comey on Thursday as well. Instead of focusing on Comey s conversations with Trump, and on Trump s inappropriate, unethical, and possibly illegal behavior, Rubio decided to focus instead on leaks, saying to Comey: You know, this investigation is full of leaks, left and right. Do you ever wonder why of all the things in this investigation the only thing that s never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation, despite the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in the leadership of Congress knew that and have known that for weeks? Comey, unfazed by Rubio s clear attempt to force him to make Trump look good, simply said,  I don t know. Here is video of that exchange:Cotton s tactics were even slimier. He went after Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) regarding statements she had made regarding the Russia matter during television appearances months ago. He reminded Comey and America that at the time, Senator Feinstein had said on national television that she saw no evidence of Team Trump having worked with the Russians. Cotton then asked Comey how he felt about those statements. Again, Comey didn t take the bait, and said: I don t doubt that Sen. Feinstein was saying what she understood. Here is video of that exchange:Considering what we know about Trump s penchant for pressuring people, it is entirely possible that at that dinner, Rubio and Cotton made some kind of loyalty pledge. It was clear from the questioning that these two Senators had one goal and one goal only: to clear Trump of any wrongdoing   be it legally or for political benefit in the minds of the American public.So, there you have it, folks. The GOP cares more about their party than they do their country. They don t care if there are Russian stooges in the White House   just since those stooges are members of their party.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 8, 2017",party country testimony director cotton al house dinner trump optics fact situation trump direction none sniveling favor president decent light tactics trump trump behavior investigation investigation thing fact president investigation fact leadership congress attempt look video exchange cotton tactics senator russia matter television time senator television evidence team trump bait doubt video exchange trump penchant people dinner cotton kind loyalty pledge goal goal trump wrongdoing benefit public party country care house party image mark
23178,Trump vs Clinton 2016: Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireToday America will choose its next president. What can you say that hasn t already been said in this, the most over-analyzed political contest in history?No matter which side of this salacious Vaudeville ticket you are on, everyone will agree this has been the most raucous and divisive contest in electoral history. No matter who wins today, half the nation will be in pain, not least of all the Founding Fathers who have been rolling in their graves for the last 18 months.More than ever, America is a nation divided. An increasing number of people are now completely immersed in hyper-active social media environments, and so it s very easy to get caught up in one s respective partisan echo chambers;  our way is the best way,   our side is right,   the other side is bad for America,   we are the true party of the people  etc.  Many individuals simply will not  venture off of their assigned party or pseudo-ideological reservations, much less talk to anyone whose views seem to oppose theirs. In public, partisan Americans will only huddle with those who share the same team colors, and in private each flees to his or her prefabricated partisan media outlet or social  networking group. This virtual political matrix is now systematically divided in this way. There is nothing in between:  no middle ground, no real commons, and no respite from the onslaught of partisan media. Herein lies the fundamental problem in 2016 politics   and why the fall-out from this election will be ongoing long after the results are announced tomorrow morning.To make matters even worse, this election season has featured two highly flawed candidates in Donald J Trump and Hillary Clinton. Many commentators contend that these are the two worst US presidential candidates ever. Essentially it boils down to Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil.Let s quickly profile the two candidates:Since the 1990 s the Clintons have been synonymous with one word: scandal. The 90 s was a dodgy decade for the First Family: Bill, Monica, Whitewater, the Arkancide epidemic, and selling White House s Lincoln Bedroom for 50 grand a night. Take your pick. None of this has helped Hillary in terms of public trust, where she s polling even lower than Donald Trump. On top of all the old Clinton baggage, you have two huge new scandals originating from her tenure as Obama s Secretary of State   including becoming the latest member of her family to lie under oath to Congress (way to go Bill), this time over Hillary s private email server cover-up, and multiple pay-to-play corruption allegations at the Clinton Foundation.As result, Hillary Clinton embodies the avatar of Cruella de Vil  Her campaign breaks down like this: Fighting for Woman and Children If you support Hillary Clinton then you believe your candidate represents the ascendency of the female species, and especially all women who have been held back by the cruel customs of an American patriarchal society. You also recognize her brand: Clinton. She s the wife of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, which leads you directly into the second half of the campaign pitch:  She has the experience, having been around the White House for 8 years. Since the beginning of her first campaign in 2008, Clinton the woman was the main identifier and the primary reason why she should be president. Instead it was  the first black President,  so she had to wait 8 years. At the age of 69, she s past her prime, but she d still be the first woman president and therefore, we re told,  an inspiration to women everywhere  as the marketing slogan says. She is also the champion of all minorities, as well as the poor   which are also traditional Democratic Party staples, although the  poor point is hard to square, seeing that the Clinton s have amassed a net worth in the hundreds of millions in the short space of 15 years   primarily by monetizing their time in public office through enormous speaking fees and scraping off expenses and lifestyle extras from their billion dollar Foundation slush fund (a whole other scandal). Regardless, her supporters see her as their champion, rallying around a familiar set of leftwing social issues: inequality/redistribution of wealth, pro-choice/abortion, amnesty for undocumented/illegal immigrants, and man-made global warming/climate change.The novelty of Trump is like no other before him. At first, it could be explained like this: for some strange reason, it s a tradition in America that a certain number of people each year will cast a write-in vote for Mickey Mouse on their ballot. This is regarded as the ultimate protest vote   a vote for Mickey is a vote against the establishment. So it should be no surprise that when he arrived on the electoral scene in June 2015, his support base was already waiting for him   Trump was their 70 year old, 6 foot 3 inch, 236 lbs Mickey Mouse Trump s campaign breaks down like this: Make America Great Again If you support Trump, then you believe this is the story of a true underdog, the consummate outsider taking on the political elites   a man with absolutely no experience in political office (other than writing cheques for nearly all them), uncorrupted by corporate money (because he has his own) and shunned by the self-serving political and media establishment who have done nothing for the country s working class and rapidly disappearing middle class. While some of this is true, as a reality TV icon, a billionaire property magnate and career playboy, Trump is certainly no  man of the people  in the Horatio Alger sense. Despite all that, judging by most major polls, nearly half of the United States population is behind him. To them, he is their champion. He ll lower taxes and bring back the jobs from overseas, rebuild the military, and most importantly, he doesn t want any money from corporate lobbyists. When crowds chant,  Drain the swamp!  referring to Washington DC, he s the man they want to hire to do that job. Trump s response to them is simple:  I only work for one special interest group, and that s you the American people.  In this sense, Trump has run the most unconventional political campaign ever.Love him or loath him, that message resonates and for good reason. The door to the cess pit is now open and many are horrified at what they see. Through the incredible WikiLeaks Podesta Email trove, many Americans have been able to peek inside the rude, incestuous and outright nasty elite political scene that controls Washington DC. Clinton was hit pretty hard by the WikiLeaks revelations, as was the already shaky credibility of the Clinton Foundation. This exposed a lot of the corruption around her and the party. Also, ten days before the election FBI Director James Comey through a grenade into the Clinton juggernaut by announcing the FBI would reopen Hillary s email case because of data discovered through her chief aid Huma Abedin s estranged sex-pest husband Anthony Weiner. This put a timely dent into Clinton s lead. With the help of the US media though, she battled though it and emerged from that m l e.Although he faced much less in terms of real institutional corruption scandals, Trump did not fair as well in public relations terms as Clinton did. Part of the reason for this was that Trump and the establishment media are like chalk and cheese. He s too unconventional for the bland gatekeepers. One of the reasons media operatives hated Trump was because he could generate his own gravity, and this posed a direct challenge to state-oriented propaganda machines like CNN who are busy spoon-feeding their own artificial version of reality to the American people. So, after a brief primary honeymoon, the media (aside from FOX News) declared all-out war on Trump. With each passing week, he was hamstrung by an endless string of media traps, Twitter gaffes and internal campaign tedium. Dogged by the media and his opponents, Trump couldn t hold his tongue or stay off of Twitter, and so his retaliatory tirades turned into negative headlines. For intelligent pundits and moderate supporters, the constant gaffes and distractions made it almost impossible to consider Donald Trump as a serious candidate. To the casual observer, it would appear that The Donald was nothing but a stalking horse for Hillary.The same could be said for Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders (photo, left). Up until the moment he entered the contest in July 2015, party favorite Hillary Clinton was essentially running unopposed. It s almost as if Sanders was drafted into the race at the last minute in order to make it look like a real race, and then at an opportune moment   he would pledge his allegiance to the party favorite. That s exactly how it played out. Early on Sanders  chances were practically DOA because of the Democratic Party s pre-rigged  Super Delegate  system. Still, he fought on and pulled bigger crowds than Hillary. Then the real bomb dropped when it was revealed through the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email leaks how party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Shultz along with party elites, conspired to railroad the Bernie Sanders campaign. That s right, Bernie was shot down by his own party in order to make way for Hillary s coronation. Not very democratic of the Democrats. Wasserman-Shultz even resigned as a result. Sanders didn t seem to mind (in public anyway) and voluntarily capitulated, and Hillary enjoyed a steady climb afterwards. From this we can deduce that the Clinton-Sanders contest was likely a contrived affair from the onset, although one WikiLeaks email shows that Sanders may even have been blackmailed into bowing down to Clinton. It seems that the DNC and Clinton never expected Sanders to capture the imagination of the nation s youth like he did, which also speaks volumes about the acute lack of enthusiasm for Clinton s White House run   even within her own party. Sanders was a rock star, Clinton was a pop star. That s a big difference in the eyes of millennials who place a lot of value on authenticity.Then came the debates. The first one broke all ratings records for a political debate with an estimated near 100 million total viewers. It was Gladiator meets Jerry Springer. Then the New York Times leaked some of Trump s tax returns and the media had a field day. Later in October, a barrage of bombshells would besiege the Trump campaign, one after another, ranging from allegations of groping on a first class flight in the 1980 s, to a porn star upset over Trump s manly advances   each of them suddenly appearing in the media right before the election to complain about being sexually harassed by Trump. After the first debate, a rather lurid, leaked off the record audio conversation from Access Hollywood in 2005 appeared which nearly upended his campaign, immediately followed by a new string of women coming forward with more allegations sexual abuse. This devastated Trump in the polls, and became the 24 hour obsession for Democratic Party-linked networks like CNN and MSNBC. Amazingly, every one of the accusers has since disappeared from the scene. The damage was done though, and this became the basis for the Clinton campaign, her TV ads and her surrogates  anti-Trump message.  Just like with Hillary s Podesta emails, it was non-stop media chaos. The attacks and counter attacks were many   too many to mention here.Somehow, he crawled out of that pit and rebounded in the polls.Trump was also being attacked in the media for proffering that the  system is rigged . In all seriousness, does anyone not believe this? Still, critics have called this  extremist  rhetoric from Trump. From a media standpoint however, America s democracy is rigged   and clearly in favor of the Democratic Party. WikiLeaks proved through the release of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta s emails   starting with the corruption between DNC acting chair Donna Brazile who cheated the debate process by passing questions from the network CNN   directly to Hillary Clinton. If that wasn t bad enough, it was later revealed how the DNC tried to provide CNN anchor Wolf Blizter with questions to ask Donald Trump, and how DNC staffers offered CNN s Jake Tapper questions to ask during another interview on the network. CNN s chief political correspondent Gloria Borger was also exposed as one of many so-called  journalists  in private contact with the Clinton campaign. The online journal Politico s editor Glenn Thrush was also caught stage-managing coverage with the Clinton campaign. As yet, none of these media operatives have been fired, or have resigned   which says a lot about the corrupt culture of the mainstream media in the United States today. There were many other incidents covered by WikiLeaks, too many to list here. Total collusion between the so-called  press  and the Democratic Party. So, yes, the system is rigged. This is no longer debatable, and the fact that the public now understand this should haunt media operative long after this election. When They Go Low, We Go High While this election may have been bad for the American people, it s been great for one groups of insiders: elite advertising agencies and the TV networks who sell ad space to the campaigns. The Clinton campaign combined with the pro-Clinton Super PACs spent upwards of $200 million on TV ads   the majority of which were negative ads characterizing her competitor as a racist xenophobic womanizing misogynist. By doing so, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party effectively made their pitch to voters as a referendum on political correctness. In other words,  we can t allow this disgusting human being to win this election.  The other big Clinton TV ad buy was,  We can t let Donald Trump get his hands on the nuclear codes.  This ad was based on the ridiculous premise that a US President could just walk into the Oval Office one day and start launching ICBM warheads around the world for no reason   a completely bogus thesis if there ever was one, but apparently the campaign thought the public was stupid enough to believe this fictional scenario.  As result of the all the negative campaigning, Clinton spent very little if any, substantial time speaking or debating the details of domestic issues and her chequered foreign policy record, particularly regarding the horrendous failures of Libya and Syria. Instead, on numerous occasions, especially during the debates, she would refer people to  my website    as if that s what people really wanted. Normally, people want to hear it from the candidates mouth, but the internet has offered a nice respite for politicians who prefer not to get tangled in discussing real issues in the flesh.It should be noted that from the beginning, the gender argument has been pervasive in all Clinton messaging, almost to the point of entitlement.  It s about time for woman to become president. We re going to make history with the first woman in the White House.  For many Americans, however, this message based purely on identity politics tends to push discussion of the candidate s  credentials and policies to the background. It is also used to fend of any criticism or inquiry into policy specifics. Not surprisingly, Clinton has mostly steered away from specifics or making any promises   unlike her predecessor Obama did when he promised everything imaginable for his first  100 Days  in order to attract votes  including closing the offshore eyesore, Guantanamo Bay Prison, and bringing the troops home from Iraq on his first day. None of this actually happened, which fuelled a lot of disenchantment and skepticism from younger voters this time around. Clinton s gender platform has also been augmented by a racial plank, and the campaign constantly reminds its supporters that blacks and other ethnic minorities should have common cause with women, inferring that their liberal cohorts have also been held back by the cruel customs of a white male-dominated, Anglo-Saxon patriarchal society. In 2016 Democrats have also reintroduced the topic of slavery as a major talking point, resulting in even more tension. Clinton s slogan is  Stronger Together, but one could argue that it s possible the Democratic Party s obsession with promoting identity politics has done more to foster new political and social divisions (and subdivisions), rather than to unite all of society under a common national identity. This is a debate which should happen, but few dare to challenge the political left on that issue. Some food for thought: a recent Rasmussen Poll concluded that race relations in the US have deteriorated under President Obama, the highest dissatisfaction mark since he was elected eight years ago   up 18 points since 2014. Why have  race relations  gone down hill? This poll result appeared for a reason, and it s probably not just because white America was upset they elected a black president in 2008, although this is what Democrats insist when you show them this particular poll. It could also be related to the caustic, relentless confrontational identity politics agenda being pushed by  agents of change  in the new radical left. Or maybe it simply reflects a fundamental failure of a political leadership which only panders to its own side of the aisle   and shuns the other. America will remain divided unless both Democrats and Republicans,  liberals  and  conservatives  can figure one how to overcome this flaw.Although Bill might be his wife s greatest asset, he is also her biggest Achilles heal. Hillary has built her entire political career on the back her two-term husband   with the former First Lady slipping seamlessly into brand Clinton and a ready-made political legacy. After Hillary unleashed the misogynist card on Trump, Bill soon came under fire over his own sordid history of sexual deviance. After that, Bill was used sparingly in pubic. Instead, the Clinton camp relied heavily on the White House to do its campaigning for them. As a result, the First Lady, Michelle Obama and the President did many of the big campaign stops in Hillary s absence. Collectively, it seemed as if Hillary s VIP surrogates did more campaigning than she did herself. Multimillionaire celebrity surrogates lined up to stump for Hillary, including Katie Perry (image, above), Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Jay Z, Beyonce and even LeBron James.Looking cool with the kids. So Clinton is being backed by the billionaire Hollywood entertainment wing of the Establishment.Even with all of that celebrity power though, Trump still attracted vastly bigger crowds on his own. But how? Why would a minimum of 15,000 at every stop turn out just for Trump?With more than a touch of irony, the one person who articulated this phenomenon better than anyone else was a radical left-wing icon, filmmaker Michael Moore. He recently filmed a one man show entitled TrumpLand where Moore s said this: I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump and they don t necessarily like him that much, and they don t necessarily agree with him. They re not racist or rednecks, they re actually pretty decent people, and so after talking to a number of them I wanted to write this:Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of Ford Motor executives and said,  if you close these factories as you re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, I m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody s going to buy them.  It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin   the  Brexit  states. You live here in Ohio, you know what I m talking about. Whether Trump means it or not, is kind of irrelevant because he s saying the things to people who are hurting, and that s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. He is the human molotov cocktail that they ve been waiting for. The human hand grande that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.And on November 8, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank, and next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone, the car s been repoed, they haven t had a real vacation in years, they re stuck with the shitty Obamacare Bronze Plan where you can t even get a fucking percocet. They ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing   the one thing that doesn t cost them a cent, and is guaranteed to them by the American constitution: the right to vote. They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up it doesn t matter, because it s equalized on that day   a millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job: one. And there s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.So on November 8, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. They see that the elite who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him, and now hate. Yes, on November 8, you Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, all the Blows get to go and blow up the whole goddamn system because it s your right. Trump s election is going to be the biggest fuck ever recorded in human history and it will feel good. Reading that, you can t help but feel that Moore has some real anger issues. Nonetheless, he inadvertently delivered the best pro-Trump speech of the election.For many, including Michael Moore, Trump might not be the ideal vehicle for such a profound movement, and yet, he is that vehicle.Granted, half of the American population have been conditioned to hate Trump for various reasons. But many of them are missing the key point in the Trump story, just like they did in the Sanders story. Trump offered millions of voters something profound: the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is Washington DC, anything is still possible in American politics   where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class.This concept should not be underestimated. It s a fundamental tenet of the American culture. As flawed an individual as he might be   at this moment in time, Donald Trump is the avatar who embodies this idea of opportunity and hope.In today s political reality show and infotainment media environment, timing is everything and America loves a comeback. Trump s late October surge in the polls certainly reflected that public sentiment and overall enthusiasm. Trump has flown more miles and visited more cities than any other presidential candidate in memory   so he s not leaving much on the table in terms of energy. Will this translate into votes in key swing states? We ll see Sure, when it all started, Donald Trump was Mickey Mouse, but somewhere along the way, the novelty has transformed into a bona fide movement. The fact that Trump, a candidate with zero political experience, bested a total of 16 other GOP primary candidates   all of whom were seasoned, career politicians   revealed just how profoundly unpopular establishment party stalwarts are with the general electorate. No amount of TV advertising can gloss over this realty. What began as a  protest vote  for so many who no longer trust or feel any affinity with elite politicians, has since morphed into a powerful mandate for change.Trump s victory during the GOP primaries was also historic   it signalled an outright rejection of the party establishment, of the constant banal Republican bickering over who is the  most conservative,  and the traditional construct of the polished politician. Trump smashed all of this. He has done exactly as Reagan did in the 1980 s   he pole vaulted over a stiff, entrenched establishment   and took his message directly to the people.On the Democratic Party slate, the exact same phenomenon unfolded, with candidate Bernie Sanders gathering tens of millions of anti-establishment and anti-war voters in the 12 months preceding the Democratic Party Convention. In modern media terms Sanders couldn t be any less appealing   with his unkept hair, the dandruff flaking off of the shoulders of his dodgy suit coats, and a semi-hunchback look. His supporters couldn t care less. The legions of college aged students didn t seem to care about the looks or the lack of Clintonesque cleverly scripted sound bites. Sanders could rattle off facts and issues without a teleprompter, and he did it with genuine conviction   something Clinton still struggles with. Regarding the wars, as Sanders rightly pointed out, unlike Hillary Clinton, he voted against the Iraq War in 2003. This also resonated with the grassroots base. Additionally, unlike his opponent, Sanders was not pandering to Wall Street and accepting large sums of money from elite financial interests.To his base, Sanders was the real deal   and for the same reasons that Trump s base is still behind him. The political and media establishment have gone to great lengths to conceal this reality, but in doing so they are only delaying their eventual demise.This is a long tail trend which is not going to reverse itself, and it s not confined to the US either   it s international. We saw this to some extent with the BREXIT vote this past summer which defied the political media establishment s version of consensus reality. Political stalwarts and generational glad-handers will try their hardest to ignore it, but it s a clear public mandate   away from the carefully controlled establishment model of politics. Last year in Britain, millions of voters shunned the Labour Party establishment and mainstream media favorites, and instead threw massive support behind the current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Like Sanders, Corbyn is not a media poster boy. Before this year, you d have been hard-pressed to spot the aging Corbyn clean-shaven, or wearing a suit, much less a tie. This political shift confounded all of the  experts  and has triggered a tectonic shift in the Labour Party itself, as acolytes and devotees of former Prime Minister Tony Blair have all but thrown their toys out of their prams over the Corbyn issue. Like with Sanders, the people gathered in droves behind a brazenly anti-establishment and antiwar leader who was cast aside by the party establishment and media operatives.In Italy, a similar populist movement is well under way with the Five Star Movement, originally launched in 2011 by Italian comedian and entertainer Beppe Grillo. Five Star are now in Parliament. The term  Five Star  symbolizes five key issues for the party: public water, sustainable transport, sustainable development, right to internet access, and environmentalism. Similarly, Spain has recently seen the world s first crowd-funded political party with Podemos (translated  We Can ). This is the future.As far as the lesser of two evils is concerned, the corruption issue weighs heavier with Clinton. While Trump s scandals derive from his private and business life, Clinton s scandals are from her time in public office, and involve current and past Democratic political operatives and appointees   and so they deserve more scrutiny and accountability as they were done on taxpayer time, and bound by supposed strict codes of conduct. In stead, the media has worked hard to equate various mini-scandals from Trump with the mega-scandals of the Clintons when clearly these are two different things. Sp far, Clinton seems to have been able to remain above the law   which has done a lot to fuel resentment against her, the White House and a highly politicized Department of Justice..On paper, America has a stark choice. Donald Trump seems to be an anti-globalist, anti-TPP, free market oriented, populist nationalist. Hillary Clinton seems to represent  equality for all,  but more than that she represents the status quo, a continuation of Barack Obama and his failing Obamacare legacy, an establishment elitist globalist agenda with a radical leftist bent.But how much will either candidate s presidency actually resemble their campaigns?If Clinton wins you can expect a huge celebrity-studded Gala Ball in Washington DC, followed by 18 months of Congressional hearings, indictments, impeach hearings and general gridlock. Expect the usual cast of suspects in her Cabinet, surrounded by all the usual insiders. Expect Bill to be named Hillary s  Economic Tsar.  In the Democratic tradition, Hillary will raise taxes and increase spending. This is why Wall Street loves Clinton (and why she accepts their money), because like with Obama, Clinton s Washington will certainly sink further into debt   and Wall Street profits from this debt. Also, expect the Clintons  net worth to sky rocket. Still, with so many scandals already on the boiler, it will get ugly, and it will stay ugly. There will be gridlock well into 2020. Like Obama did with the issue of  race,  Clinton will certainly make gender the defining issue of her presidency, as well as continue hammering home the idea that America has a  race  problem. The culture wars will continue and America will become a cultural Marxist battleground. Hillary Clinton s America will be a sectarian America. So expect those Rasmussen numbers to continue on their present trajectory. Expect Trump supporters to call foul on  vote rigging  too.There will be some vote rigging, as there has been in many US elections. Just this past week, there have been multiple cases of voter fraud in the US (and these are only the cases where people have actually been caught). . With Hillary, sooner than later, you can also expect an escalation of rhetoric and ill-informed talk of  No Fly Zones  in Syria and military a confrontation with Russia, and possibly even Iran. Lots of wars and proxy wars. This is why the Neocons love Hillary.If Trumps wins, the mainstream media will be in a state of shock, followed by a state of panic, followed by a state of chaos. Sure, Trump may wish to unite America, but this is a near insurmountable task now after 8 years of Sharpton-Obama political agitation and other artificial divisions constructed through hundreds of  progressive  front organizations funded by social engineers like billionaire George Soros. If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage. You can also be certain that Clinton, the Democrats and their media operatives at CNN, MSNBC and others, will blame Vladimir Putin and the Russians for hacking the US election in favor of Trump. Although Trump may cut taxes, like Reagan he will likely balloon federal spending. It is also unlikely Trump will make any significant dent in the national debt which is currently hovering around $10 trillion. However, with Trump, there is a chance to de-escalate the aggressive posturing this current White House and Hillary Clinton have take against Russia. This would be an important benefit of a Trump presidency   a chance for a positive relationship between the US and Russia.Regardless of which person wins, expect FBI director Jim Comey to resign after this election.Expect both candidates to prosecute their  war on ISIS , their  war on poverty , their  war on drugs  and their  war on domestic extremism. The election result is only the beginning. The real battle will take place afterwards.Expect a heavily divided and half bitter nation.Expect serious political party alternatives to emerge, building on the mild successes of the Libertarian and Green parties.Tomorrow, history will be made by either the outsider Trump, or the insider Clinton.When you re talking about the outsiders though, whether it s Trump, Sanders, Corbyn or Grillo, no matter how pious or forthright, they will ultimately get caught in the gears of government, with all its trappings of nepotism and institutional corruption. The outsider eventually becomes the insider. Resisting that pressure is the age-old challenge to any reformer.If there s one lesson to be learned by this year s US presidential race, it s certainly an old lesson by now. Depending on what your view of communism is, Karl Marx is either a villain or a hero of social engineering, but he left us some interesting quotes. Marx did get one thing right when he said,  Elections give the people the right every few years to choose which member of the ruling class will misrepresent them.  It s still true today.Or as someone once said,  No matter who you vote for the government always gets in. We ll see which government gets in tomorrow.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 8, 2016",century

7427, ‘Newtown’ Documentary Sheds New Light On Gun Violence In America (VIDEO),"Newtown, Connecticut was the site of one of the most horrific mass shootings in United States history at Sandy Hook Elementary School. On December 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza brutally murdered 20 children in first grade, in addition to six school staff members, before he committed suicide.A new documentary, Newtown, discusses in depth the aftermath and wake the mass shooting left. The film s World Premiere was featured at the Sundance Film Festival this past January, and is continuing along the film festival circuit, with the next screenings scheduled for the Cleveland International Film Festival later this month. Filmed over the course of three years, the documentary features interviews with family members of those who were lost, first responders, and school staff members, as the event changed the course of all their lives forever.Despite the incitement caused by the tragedy in Newtown for government legislators to make policy changes which would help prevent future Adam Lanzas from committing similar horrible crimes, those calls fell on deaf ears in Congress. Instead, mass shootings continue to occur across the United States, while no action is taken to decrease their frequencies. Instead, states like Texas, West Virginia, Florida, and most other states in the country allow open carry guns without any sort of special permit. As calls for gun control increased from the public, the NRA and their lobbyists have reacted by pushing for gun ownership to become the norm.In a July 2015 interview, President Barack Obama told the BBC,  The one area that I feel I ve been most frustrated and most stymied is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient, common sense gun safety laws, even in the sense of repeated mass killings.

10996,HOW PAUL RYAN JUST Made A Mockery Of Trump’s Promise To Protect Blue-Collar Jobs From Foreign Workers,"The bipartisan congressional language creates a headache for Trump and his deputies because it flips the politically difficult problem from Congress to the Department of Homeland Security of deciding whether to provide extra wage-cutting H-2B contract workers to companies or else to improve job opportunities for Trump s blue-collar voters.The new rule helps business groups offset rising pressure for wage increases, just 18 months before the mid-term elections when voters will vet the success or not of Trump s  Buy American, Hire American  policies.The H-2B language was hidden deep in the draft 2017 supplemental budget   which is to face House and Senate votes this week   and it surprised opponents of the legislation. In December 2016, Ryan had agreed to trim the program when the partial 2017 budget deal was announced just one month after blue-collar voters backed Donald Trump s campaign promise of a low-immigration, high-wage national economic policy.Apparently nothing is going to change, as long as Speaker Ryan remains at the helm.

7238," WATCH: Mean Teenage Girls Read Trump Tweets, And Suddenly They Make Sense","A new parody video shows that the ridiculously juvenile tweets from Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump make perfect sense, as long as they are read by mean teenage girls.The video, produced by Nylon magazine, shows a series of teens reading Trump s tweets verbatim, adding only the snark and derisive tone that can be found in the halls of high schools from coast to coast.One girl reads,  Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Another tells us,  Get a life Megyn!  That s an actual tweet during one of Trump s many feuds with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump has, of course, praised the effectiveness of his Twitter account but it s hard to blame him when insults that are 10th grade at best generate headlines in all the major newspapers without Trump having to spend a dime. He s compared it to owning his own printing press, and while he won t be nominated for a Pulitzer any time soon, his pronouncements of  Sad!  have already become a campaign clich .The downside of Twitter and parody videos like this for Trump, however, are that they expose how juvenile and simplistic his campaign and the Republican Party are. While the dumbing down of America is a very real problem, when it comes to crunch time in the voting booth it is unlikely that most of the 65 percent or so of America that aren t rabid Trump fans will actually decide to vote for an insulter in chief.For the rest of the country, these videos and Trump s own words highlight the intellectual deficit between Trump and his own party, let alone the leading candidates on the Democratic side.If the country is going to elect someone who tweets like a mean girl, why would you go with a pampered billionaire?

8428, Bernie Sanders Takes On Walmart In This Speech And It Is Glorious (VIDEO),"During a campaign event at Iowa s Wesleyan University, Bernie Sanders spoke to the audience about how Walmart and other large corporations benefit from a  rigged economy. Sanders begins by saying that Walmart is very appreciative of all the support they receive from taxpayers: Just to give you an example of what a rigged economy is all about.  I mentioned the Walton family   the wealthiest family in the world   being very appreciative that you are supporting them. They re very happy about that.  And they asked me to send you their thanks. Sanders continues, saying: They re only worth 60 of 70 billion dollars and they do appreciate you paying taxes to help them subsidize their workers. This is how we re going to pay to put 13 million Americans back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. There has been a lot of criticism of Sanders that says that he does not have a plan to pay for the programs he is proposing. That is absolute nonsense. Here is a comprehensive funding plan for every policy Sanders has proposed.And to the right-wingers who shout the obnoxiously classist claim that people only support Sanders because he wants to give them  free stuff,  that s actually the opposite of what Sanders wants. What he wants is for corporations to stop getting free stuff from tax payers. As Sanders points out in the speech: Three major profitable corporations not only pay nothing in federal income taxes, they actually got a rebate from the IRS. Three major corporations made over $100 billion in profit, paid nothing in taxes, and in fact, got a rebate from the I.R.S. Right now we have a rigged economy where there is socialism for the rich, and unregulated capitalism for the rest.Sanders concludes his speech, saying that closing these loopholes will help fund one of his most inspiring programs. That s how were going to pay to rebuild our infrastructure and put millions of people back to work.

1495, Lawyers Trump Used To ‘Prove’ He Has No Russia Connection Won ‘Russia Law Firm Of The Year’ In 2016,"It was the tweet that blew up the internet:BREAKING: Trump lawyer: Tax returns from past 10 years show no ""income of any type from Russian sources,"" with few exceptions.  The Associated Press (@AP) May 12, 2017The headscratching claim by Trump s lawyers was that he had  no income of any type  from Russia  with few exceptions.The exceptions cited don t raise many eyebrows. What is noticeably absent is any mention of the Russia megadonors Eric Trump recently bragged helped finance Trump s golf resort, leading one to assume that there are things being intentionally left out of this report. (Eric Trump now denies making this admission, unfortunately Eric has been known to lie before.)The follow up story published by the Associated Press was even more bizarre (emphasis added).President Donald Trump s lawyers say a review of his last 10 years of tax returns do not reflect  any income of any type from Russian sources,  with some exceptions.The lawyers did not release copies of Trump s tax returns so The Associated Press cannot independently verify their conclusions.So Trump s lawyers  reviewed  Trump s tax returns and   surprise   found that he is completely innocent of any wrongdoing. But they won t let reporters independently verify those findings. So we just have to take their word for it If that s the case, then the law firm doing the investigation better have an absolutely impeccable record. Instead, Trump got one that has even more connections than he (allegedly!) does.The lawyers Trump turned to work for a firm called Morgan Lewis. It does a lot of business in Russia. It does so much business in Russia, in fact, that it actually nabbed a prestigious award for being  Russia Law Firm of the Year  in 2016.The law firm that sent the letter RE: Trump's biz interests in Russia was recognized as ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" in 2016: pic.twitter.com/t7yBFpl1Hn  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) May 12, 2017Others argue the law firm is merely a victim of its own success. It s a global company, of course it would be in Russia.Trump letter is dumb for other reasons, but not this. Morgan Lewis & Bockius is one of the biggest & most well-known lawfirms in the world. https://t.co/gBeg7Ms0EP  Jeff B/DDHQ (@EsotericCD) May 12, 2017However, this needn t be a massive conspiracy. Something worth thinking about: This group   which has a vested interest in not upsetting Trump and Putin   wants us to take their word at facevalue when they say that Trump is completely innocent. The very fact that they have business relationships and clients in Russia means they would feel pressured to tread lightly. Russia, a country run not only by Putin but a collective of oligarchs, can destroy your business if they feel antagonized by what you re doing.Making matters even more shady, Trump s lawyers claim they just released these findings at the behest of a congressional request. But the letter they sent is two months old. If it were that old, it may explain why Trump s lawyers didn t bother to mention Trump s Russian golf course investors. They didn t think it would come out. News of that relationship only leaked in the past few weeks.But there s an easy way to clear all this up: Trump could always release his tax returns to the public.Featured image via AFP-OUT",News,"May 12, 2017",tweet lawyer tax income type press claim trump income type russia mention russia trump golf resort report admission follow story press emphasis president trump review tax income type trump tax press cannot tax surprise wrongdoing let word case law firm investigation record firm lot business russia business russia fact award law firm year law firm letter trump biz russia russia law firm year pic twitter argue law firm victim success company course trump letter world jeff conspiracy something group interest trump word trump fact business russia country collective business trump behest request letter trump trump golf course news relationship way trump tax public image

2163, Twitter TEARS Paul Ryan To BLOODY RIBBONS For Praising CBO Review Of GOP Healthcare Plan (TWEETS),"The Congressional Budget Office s review of the Republicans  replacement plan for the ACA is out, and it s not good news. Under the plan, 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage by 2026. 14 million of those people will see their insurance ripped from them just in the next two years. In total, this plan will result in 52 million uninsured people in 2026. Over the next four years, premiums are expected to rise by as much as 20 percent more than they would under the ACA. Premiums might fall for younger people after 2020 but would continue to rise for older people.And on it goes.Paul Ryan, however, sees the report as a resounding endorsement of the plan because it will reduce the deficit by a whole $336 billion over a decade and is supposed to maybe lower premiums at some point in the future.CBO report confirms it   American Health Care Act will lower premiums & improve access to quality, affordable care. https://t.co/jNzmYFPe9H pic.twitter.com/f0NGuLiztl  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 13, 2017And Twitter is throwing a livid fit with him for that tweet, as well they should.

13717,"The “Brown” The Media Wont’ Cover Because He Wasn’t Killed By A White Cop…Raekwon Juaquay Brown,17 Year Old Hero Sacrifices His Life To Save An Elderly Woman","If his name was Michael Brown if he robbed a local convenience store and roughed up the store manager if he tried to take a gun from the cop who confronted him and was killed by it in the struggle, the media might have covered it. But this was just an innocent 17 year old boy minding his own business when he was faced with the awful decision of whether to risk his own life and save the life of a total stranger or stand back and watch an elderly woman be killed. This hero chose to sacrifice his own life. If we lived in a world where real heroism is not celebrated because it s not controversial. In a good and decent world, Raekwon Juaquay Brown s name would be more of a household name than that of thug Michael Brown. But we live in a world where the Left celebrates victimhood and real or imagined, a good victim can always be used to prop up a cause. #RIP Raekwon Juaquay Brown you are a hero. Seventeen-year-old Raekwon Juaquay Brown sacrificed his life when he pushed an elderly woman out of the way of gunfire before he was slain in Wednesday s daylight shooting near Jeremiah E. Burke High School, the grief-stricken lady told the Herald just hours before a vigil honoring the young hero. He saved my life   I have a new life,  the woman, 67, said in Spanish yesterday while tears streamed down her face. He was only 17. I ve lived here 10 years, I ve never seen anything like this. There needs to be more police here,  she said, showing a wound to her right ankle, where police say she was grazed.The woman was one of four people struck by gunfire in the 1:15 p.m. ambush that left Brown, a Burke High junior, dead. Her name is being withheld by the Herald because she is a witness to the murder.She explained she was in an alley by a pizza shop when the shooting broke out. The teen, who was sitting down eating a hamburger, got up and pushed her to the side by a car, she claimed.Last night hundreds of people, including at least a dozen family members, crowded in front of the market on Washington Street less than a block from the school where Brown fell.Some men turned and walked away in tears while several women dabbed their eyes with tissues from a box that was being passed around. Brown s mother, Wanda Graddy, supported by several relatives, walked toward a memorial for her son, where she cried,  My boy, my boy. The Rev. William Dickerson of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church spoke first and called for the killer to step forward and for witnesses to name him. We pray that justice will come in the midst of this terrible reality,  Dickerson said.Family members said they hope that whoever pulled the trigger will surrender. Stop being cowards,  said Raekwon s older brother, John Brown.  Stand up like a man. Take your consequences. Beside him was the slain teen s godmother, Jacqueline Cane. I just want you to know, whoever did it, turn yourself in,  she said.  You re not going to sleep until you turn yourself in. That was a good guy here. This was my God-baby. Seventeen years old, you took his life. Turn yourself in or you will never rest. Mourners said another prayer and then hugged as they departed.Burke school staff also took time out from the day to recall Brown as a selfless teen. Raekwon was probably one of the most loving and caring students I have ever had in the Sophomore Academy,  said Cheryl Windle, leader for the academy.  He actually had this warmth about him that I really believe captures his true essence. He will truly be missed by all of us here at the Burke community. Lindsa McIntyre, headmaster of Burke, said students and staff will miss Brown dearly.  He came to us as a vibrant, struggling, middle school student, looking for fun and full of vim and vigor. But as he grew in his high school career, he became a metamorphosis for what a real Burke student looks like.

I will respect your choice to leave your diction choices  as is  and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so,  the professor wrote.  By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that  mankind  does not mean  all people  to all people.

5920," No, Google Is Not Cheating For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO)","For months now, Republicans and some in the Bernie Sanders camp have been looking for a smoking gun; a damning piece of evidence that proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that Hillary Clinton is cheating. The YouTube channel, SourceFed, thought they found the smoking gun, when they demonstrated what they thought was irrefutable proof that Google was in the tank for Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, SourceFed has no idea how Google works.The premise behind the conspiracy theory involves Google s predictive search or autocomplete. When users type in partial key phrases, like  Hillary Clinton cri,  other search engines, like Bing and Yahoo, list as a possible search phrase,  Hillary Clinton crimes.  Google doesn t.Here s the video:This is what I get when I type in  Hillary Clinton cri  on Google.Yahoo gives me this:Bing, this:After watching the video, I conducted my own little experiment. Surely, if Google was in the tank for Clinton, it would show up under non-predictive search results, right? For example, I typed in the words,  Hillary Clinton  in Google, and below the paid content and the standard things on top, like Wikipedia, there s a whole lot of negative stuff:Those are the listings on page one. Going deeper into the searches brings up a lot more negative than positive.Unfortunately, my experiment isn t any more scientific than SourceFed s, but others know more and they say that it s SourceFed that was manipulating the search results, not Google. Google, which should surprise few, has a more sophisticated search engine than either Bing or Yahoo. They do sort of manipulate searches, but not to influence public opinion. They don t include unfounded negative listings in their autocomplete options, no matter how many people are searching those rumors. Clinton has never been convicted or even indicted of a crime, hence it not showing up. By the same token, entering  Donald Trump la  does not bring up  Donald Trump lawsuits,  despite the fact that a whole lot of people are searching for information about his lawsuits. It does include  Donald Trump laughing,  though.Just to test that, I entered  Bill Clinton i,  because we know he was impeached, and surely, if Google were manipulating autocomplete results for Hillary, then they would certainly do it for her husband, right? Wrong:Remember that Bernie Sanders rape fantasy essay from eons ago, that absolutely no one should care about? Google doesn t care about it either:Similarly, I did a search for  Donald Trump bri,  half expecting results for his alleged bribery of two Attorneys General. Nothing:The most ridiculous part of the SourceFed allegation, though, is their assumption that people don t continue and enter all the letters and hit  enter,  which would bring up numerous rumors, conspiracy theories and allegations, including the accusations of search manipulations by Google. You d think they d at least keep themselves from looking bad in their search rankings, right? They don t.Here s what Google has to say about it: Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person s name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms,  said the statement.Featured image via YouTube.",News,"June 11, 2016",sanders smoking gun piece evidence shadow doubt channel smoking gun proof tank idea premise conspiracy theory search search bing list search phrase video yahoo video experiment tank non search example content top lot stuff page lot search search engine yahoo sort manipulate opinion matter people crime hence token trump la trump fact lot people information bill husband right sanders essay one care search trump half bribery nothing part allegation assumption people continue enter hit enter conspiracy search search algorithm query conjunction person name number popularity search statement image
4542, Trump Used Foundation Donations To Pay Off And Settle Private Lawsuits,"Another day, another real Trump controversy. While the media hyper-focuses on Hillary Clinton s  pay-for-play  scandal (that wasn t actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the Associated Press), a Washington Post report has found a major smoking gun regarding the Trump Foundation:Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Totaling over $258,000 in Foundation money, Trump may have been involved in has violated laws against  what is known as  self-dealing  (something Trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charity s money to benefit themselves or their private businesses.So not only has the Trump Foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. And people think the Clinton Foundation is immoral?Here are some of the examples:According to the Post:In those cases, tax experts said, Trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. They had to be put to a charitable use.He did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. Which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal.So turns out the only  crooked  one in this race is Donald Trump, and the only fraud isn t the Clinton foundation, but the Trump Foundation. Illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with other people s money (for non charitable use).Of course, the Clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying Trump is a fraud who believes the rules don t apply to him,   and that  Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education.  Ouch.Let s see Fox News and the Trump camp try to spin this.Simply put, Trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. And if doesn t, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016",day trump controversy media pay play scandal scandal press post report smoking gun trump foundation spent quarter foundation billionaire profit review foundation money trump self something trump charity money trump foundation self dealing people foundation post tax trump home business use helmet use use tax race trump fraud foundation foundation lawsuit people money non use course campaign issue trump fraud apply trump foundation organization trump university institute education let news trump camp try trump needs fraud image spencer
8955, NRA Thugs Threaten Lawmakers With Bullets For Sponsoring Bill Limiting Purchase Of Ammo (IMAGE),"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 5, 2016",president background people york legislation sale ammunition bill amount ammo person day stretch gun ammunition people course legislation state senator jo rifle association pair twitter post publication freedom board someone target practice attempt violence image measure anti gun scheme tweet image day congresswoman office shooter gunman map support gun control map page hit list outrage head repeat image attempt times target someone news someone picture people york news picture harm proposal something tweet gun legislation month news mayor bill borough president tweet organization threat country gun nut shot blame image story

13032,CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER Gets “Huffy”…Dodges And Lies About Details Of Clinton’s Illness,"The LA Times Reported yesterday that Hillary Clinton s campaign manager was sure she didn t faint but just  stumbled  as she was getting into the van to leave the 9/11 ceremony. Does any of the video that s been plastered everywhere look like she just stumbled? It s more than that for sure!Flash forward to Clinton s campaign manager s interview with Kate Snow and you see a pattern here of covering up and lying about why Clinton has been ill for so long. Check out the back and forth with Kate Snow and Robbie Mook:After Clinton was seen falling into a van after attending a 9/11 memorial Sunday morning, the campaign said she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. The campaign did not mention the illness until her collapse yesterday.Snow also grilled Mook on the timeline between Clinton s fall into the van and her reappearance outside daughter Chelsea s apartment in Manhattan. Mook said Clinton wanted to cool off and see her grandchildren. ROBBIE MOOK   LYING THROUGH HIS TEETH: KATE SNOW, MSNBC: Did you know on Friday, Robby, that she was ill? Did you know that she had the diagnosis of pneumonia and if so, what did you advise her to do?ROBBY MOOK, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, she obviously saw the doctor on Friday and in consultation with her doctors, she decided to power through this. She didn t want it to affect anything. And obviously on Sunday when she got overheated it was clear she needed some downtime. So in consultation with her doctor she s taking some downtime.KATE SNOW: I asked because you are the campaign manager. You are the one in charge of this schedule and what she s doing and I wonder if you didn t know, would you have advised her to take a couple days down and not plan this trip to California today?ROBBY MOOK: Well, I am certainly   let s just say I am happy that she s getting some much needed downtime now. But she s looking forward to getting back out on the trail very soon KATE SNOW: Robby, I m reading between the lines and I want to make sure I am not misreading. I m reading between the lines of what you re saying   the staff did not know that she had pneumonia.ROBBY MOOK: Yeah, but, I want to be fair here. If we re going to be talking about transparency and disclosure, Donald Trump has not released a single piece of serious information about his health.KATE SNOW: And I will be pressing his representative in the next interview that we do with them.ROBBY: MOOK: But I hope you, I hope you  KATE SNOW: Did the staff not know that she had pneumonia on Friday? Am I right on that from what you re saying?ROBBY MOOK: I m just saying   all I m saying is that I hope that you drill in with the same detail with his team as you re drilling in with ours. We released the information as soon as we could when this happened this Sunday. I wish that it happened quicker than 90 minutes. Again, we were busy attending to her health. So that s on us.

22486,OUT IN THE OPEN: ‘9/11’ 15 Years Of A Transparent Lie,"21st Century Wire says One of the most elaborate crimes of the century continues to be whitewashed   SMOKE SCREEN    Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton There are many doorways into the crimes of 9/11. After the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, President George W. Bush called for the creation of remote control systems in commercial airliners in the event of an emergency. By design, this technology would grant air traffic controllers, along with other government entities, the ability to control an aircraft   and steer it towards its final intended destination.Based on history, we know that the Flight Management Systems within Boeing models have been capable of assisting the entire flight through its remote autopilot functions since at least 1984, well before Bush s politically motivated calls for remote control flights in the aftermath of 9/11.From the mid-1980 s, the coded software on the plane would send data to ground control stations, accepting any return flight information or auto-land command. In addition to civilian aircraft being flown remotely before it was acknowledged, the U.S. Air Force apparently constructed an F-106 Delta Dart fighter to be controlled remotely on a combat mission in 1959 under the direction of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).There has been an endless dispute over the how of 9/11 and the who, as well as the various methods used to carry out the crimes of that day. There s an even heavier debate over what brought down WTC Building 7 and since then, other 9/11  rabbit holes  have also challenged the nature of the planes said to be involved in both New York and Washington DC.Whether you re curious and bold enough to head down that path is a whole different matter, but the fact remains, the technology to take over a commercial flight existed long before 9/11.Whatever your thoughts are concerning planes on 9/11 it s still worth noting that even the mainstream media admitted at the time that there was, no evidence of a plane at all,  following the destruction of a portion of the Pentagon s western side.Indeed, 15 years on, there are still many more question than there are plausible answers.More from Paul Craig Roberts below   Einst rzende Neubauten    A single day has shaped the modern world. (Image Source: downtownexpress)9/11: 15 Years Of A Transparent LiePaul Craig RobertsThere are many conspiracy theories about 9/11. The US government s own explanation of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory in which a few Saudi Arabians outwitted the American national security state. Little doubt that many of the more imaginative conspiracy theories were created for the purpose of stigmatizing any skepticism, no matter how well reasoned and supported, of the official story.When thinking about 9/11, it is important to differentiate expert opinion from improbable explanations.Among the expert opinion are 2,600 structural engineers and high-rise architects who comprise Architects & Engineers for 9/11 truth and have written to Congress asking for a real investigation, Firefighters for 9/11 truth, Pilots for 9/11 truth, physicists and chemists who analyzed the dust from the twin towers and report finding reacted and unreacted materials used in controlled demolitions, and former government officials who understand that a security failure as great as 9/11 would have produced an immediate and exacting investigation.These groups of qualified and experienced people say that the official story of 9/11 is false.  Architects, engineers, and scientists say that the official story is physically impossible. Firefighters and WTC maintenance personnel say that there were numerous explosions within the towers and that the first explosions were in the sub-basements prior to the buildings being hit by airplanes. Experienced military and civilian pilots say the maneuvers of the aircraft are beyond the capability of the alleged hijackers. Both co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission and the legal counsel have written books in which they have said that information was withheld from the Commission, that the US government lied to the Commission, and that the Commission was set up to failIn other words, the hard evidence simply does not support the official story.We know that the official story is false. We don t know who is responsible or the purpose the event was intended to serve. However, circumstantial evidence strongly supports suspicion of the neoconservatives whose high positions in the government would have enabled them to succeed with a false flag attack and to delay and divert any investigation until the official story was set in stone. We also know from the  dancing Israelis  that elements in the Israeli government had advance notice of the attack as Israeli agents were set up ready to film the destruction of the twin towers.More from Paul Craig Roberts here READ MORE 9/11 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 9/11 Files",US_News,"September 10, 2016",century wire century photo illustration pentagon world trade center president bush creation control event emergency design technology air traffic government ability aircraft destination history flight management flight remote autopilot well remote control aftermath mid plane data control return flight information auto land command addition aircraft air force dart fighter combat mission direction defense command dispute day debate building rabbit nature york path matter fact technology flight media time evidence plane destruction portion pentagon side question day world image source transparent conspiracy government explanation conspiracy theory security state doubt conspiracy purpose skepticism matter story opinion opinion rise truth investigation truth truth dust twin report finding government security failure investigation people story story maintenance personnel sub aircraft capability chairman commission counsel information commission government commission commission evidence story story purpose event evidence suspicion government flag attack investigation story stone government notice attack film destruction twin news century wire
1339, White House Officials Push For Kushner To Step Aside Amid Russia Scandal,"Donald Trump keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole where Russia is concerned. His entire term has been plagued by a steady drip of leaks regarding his shady Russian ties. The latest revelation to become front page news is that his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, was trying to establish a secret line of communication between Trump and the Kremlin.Not surprisingly, administration officials are pushing for Kushner to step aside and take a leave of absence amid his current Russian scandal. According to ABC News, members of Trump s inner circle  are saying it might be time for Jared Kushner to take a leave of absence from the White House. Last week, it was announced that Kushner had come under intense scrutiny by the FBI because of his suspicious contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as well as a Russian banking executive. Then the Washington Post reported on Friday that Kushner had been attempting to set up a  back channel  of communication between Trump and Moscow.To call this news a bombshell (a term that has become a cliche with Trump in the White House) would be an understatement. Former intelligence officials, with decades of experience, say they had never seen anything like this before and described the news as off the map,   explosive,  and  extremely dangerous. Both Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn were forced to resign when news broke of their Russian ties. It now looks like Kushner might soon be following in their footsteps.Watch more here, via ABC News:NEW: @jonkarl: People close to the president are saying it might be time for Jared Kushner to take a leave of absence from the White House. pic.twitter.com/pIgqkNJNx1  This Week (@ThisWeekABC) May 28, 2017Featured image via Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 28, 2017",trump hole russia term drip revelation news son law advisor line communication trump kremlin administration leave absence scandal news circle time leave absence house week scrutiny ambassador banking executive post channel communication trump news bombshell term cliche trump house intelligence experience anything news map campaign manager security advisor mike news news people president time leave absence house pic twitter week image pool
434, South Dakota Republican Rigs Upcoming Election For Herself By Personally Purging Democratic Voters,"This is a clear case of election-rigging.South Dakota Secretary of State Shantel Krebs is running for Congress in 2018. But rather than win the votes of the people fair and square, Krebs is using her current position to stack the odds in her favor.The Dakota Free Press pointed out that Krebs has purged thousands of voters from the rolls in the last threes months.The September 1, 2017, South Dakota voter registration tally shows 11,762 voters 2.14% of the August 1 total removed from Active status and 11,450 newly Inactive voters. This one-month purge restocks the Inactive pool, which the Secretary of State has whittled down over the last 18 months from a March 2016 peak of 54,708 to an August 2017 low of 30,619. Inactives now total 42,069 Thus, in three months, the Secretary of State managed to scrub 3.06% of the names on the voter rolls.Considering how close elections can be in this country, three percent is a big deal and could easily be enough to guarantee a victory for Krebs in November 2018.In fact, Democratic voters were targeted most by Krebs, which makes it all the more clear that she is rigging the election to help herself. In all, 2.63 percent of Democratic voters were purged from the rolls. If Democratic voters are kept from voting, her opponent doesn t stand a chance against her.And that s probably the whole point.This is voter suppression in its ugliest form. No candidate for office should have unfettered access to the voter rolls. As Secretary of State, Krebs is supposed to make sure elections are fair. But because she is going to be a congressional candidate in 2018, it appears she has thrown fairness out the window because winning is more important to her. When she pulls up the list of voters whom the state hasn t heard from for a while, it wouldn t be hard to sort that list by party and start with the Democrats first,  the Dakota Free Press noted.That means Krebs has a conflict of interest and she should be forced to resign.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2017",case election secretary state congress people position odds favor press south voter registration august total status month purge pool secretary state march peak low secretary state voter country percent deal victory fact election percent opponent chance point suppression form candidate office access voter secretary state candidate window list state list party start press conflict interest image mark

15407,DEMOCRAT PLAN TO INFILTRATE TRADITIONALLY RED STATES IS WORKING: Virginia Sees Remarkable Mass Immigration…Next Up Texas and Georgia,"The fundamental transformation of America El Salvador is the top country of birth for immigrants to Virginia.  Indeed, the Migration Policy Institute found that from 2000 to 2008 Virginia saw its Salvadorian immigrant population grow by 13,000 persons. With it, this migration has brought the arrival of the feared Salvadorian gang, Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13.A remarkable transformation is underway in the Commonwealth of Virginia.The birthplace and final resting place of George Washington, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and once one of the most reliably-red of red states is being rapidly turned into a progressive stronghold.These changes are not the result of an inside agency, or a natural evolution in political thinking, but rather the result of one of the most impactful yet least-discussed policies of the federal government.Each year the federal government prints millions of visas and distributes these admission tickets to the poorest and least-developed nations in the world.A middle-aged person living in parts of Virginia today will have witnessed more demographic change in the span of her life than many societies have experienced in millennia.A census study entitled  Immigrants in Virginia,  released by University of Virginia (UVA) researchers, documented the phenomenon:  Until 1970, only 1 in 100 Virginians was born outside of the United States; by 2012, 1 in every 9 Virginians is foreign-born. Fairfax Connection, a community newspaper, offered more detail:In the span of one generation, Fairfax County has seen an explosion in its immigrant population. In 1970, more than 93 percent of Fairfax County s population was white and middle-class. In the fall of 1970, a white 6-year-old child beginning elementary school in one of the county s developing towns  could look to his left, or look to his right, and see a classroom full of children who, at least 90 percent of the time, looked like him and who spoke English. By 2010, a child entering elementary school in Fairfax County would almost certainly encounter a classmate who did not speak English as a primary language, and whose parents or grandparents immigrated from places such as Vietnam, India, Korea or a country in Africa.UVA s report explains that more than three out of four of Virginia immigrants (77 percent) are coming from either Latin America or Asia immigration from Europe, the report writes,  lag[s] far behind  representing only 10 percent of Virginia s immigrant population. This is consistent with trends nationwide. According to the 2013 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration Yearbook, only 8.7 percent of green cards issued by the federal government went to immigrants born in Europe, a product of immigration changes pushed through by Ted Kennedy in 1965.DHS  yearbook, however, does not provide information on parental nativity  in other words, it doesn t say whether an immigrant from the United Kingdom may be the child of Saudi parents.Additionally, according to DHS, of those refugees issued admissions slips into the United States, 75 percent came from four countries  Iraq, Burma, Somalia and Bhutan  while another 15 percent came from Iran, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Dominican Republic.Large numbers of these settlers handpicked by the federal government have come to Virginia. A 2011 article from The Washington Post explains:  Soaring number of Hispanics and Asians pushed Virginia s population over 8 million in the past decade. Statewide the number of Hispanics almost doubled to 632,000. Hispanics now make up 8 percent of Virginia residents.  The Post continues,  The state s Asian population also took off, climbing by 68 percent in 10 years. The Post notes that,  as recently as 1990, non-Hispanic whites made up 76 percent of the state s residents. A decade later, their numbers had fallen to 70 percent, and [in 2010], they accounted for less than two-thirds of the state s residents. Because these newcomers to Virginia have largely been invited into the country with green cards or other visas, they can collect public benefits, fill any job, rely on federal retirement programs, and become naturalized voting citizens.Year after year, the United States continues its annual dispensation of one million plus new green cards, the admission of one million foreign workers, refugees and dependents, and the importation of half a million foreign youths sought by college administrators.One in four U.S. residents is either an immigrant himself or has immigrant parents. The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. will add another 14 million immigrants over the following ten years if green card programs aren t slashed, pushing the U.S. past all documented historical immigration records in terms of immigrant to population ratio. When a high point was hit last century, then-President Calvin Coolidge hit the pause button for roughly fifty years  producing an era of explosive wage growth. That pause continued until Ted Kennedy ushered in legislation that granted millions of immigration visas to the entire world.The steady gusher of visas happens silently and with little media recognition, yet its effects are more permanent and transformative than many of the most far-reaching foreign policy accords.In 2012, the Richmond Times Dispatch highlighted the political effects of issuing visas to so many migrants from outside the Western World:  The population shift, most notably in Northern Virginia, is changing the state s educational, political and social landscape. The Times Dispatch continues,  Virginia s demographic changes have also transformed political leanings in the state that, before President Barack Obama s win of electoral votes in 2008, had not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. The blue-ing of Virginia brought about by continued immigration is not calculated only by measuring the voting habits of immigrants themselves, but is multiplied outward through the voting habits of immigrants  children and grandchildren. As the Times Dispatch notes:  Not all minority voters are foreign-born, of course, but many have participated in the changing political landscape.  The increase in the minority vote share stems from immigration itself:  Many immigrants come to the U.S. between the ages of 25 and 44, during the prime of their careers, and are more likely to have families here.  The results, per the Times Dispatch, are striking:  During the 2012 presidential election, when 71 percent of the state s voters went to the polls, two-thirds of Hispanic and Asian voters backed Obama. Obama carried 93 percent of the black vote, 64 percent of the Hispanic vote and 66 percent of the Asian vote, according to exit polls reported by The New York Times. Under current U.S. policy, any child born to an immigrant is guaranteed U.S. citizenship and voting rights. UVA researchers found that,  among children of immigrants, 96 percent are U.S. citizens, either by birth or through naturalization.  In today s Virginia,  almost a fifth of native-born children under the age of 18 have at least one foreign-born parent. As Reuters reported in a recent article on U.S. visa policies:  Immigrants favor Democratic candidates and liberal policies by a wide margin, surveys show, and they have moved formerly competitive states like Illinois firmly into the Democratic column and could turn Republican strongholds like Georgia and Texas into battlegrounds in the years to come. A 2014 report authored by University of Maryland professor James Gimpel, similarly found that,  the enormous flow of legal immigrants in to the country   29.5 million 1980 to 2012   has remade and continues to remake the nation s electorate in favor of the Democratic Party. The report cites a 2012 study conducted by YouGov that,  gauged the partisan preferences of over 2,900 naturalized immigrants, finding 62.5 percent to be Democratic identifiers, 24.6 percent Republican, and 12.9 percent independent. Examining the data in this study led Washington Examiner columnist Byron York to conclude:  The bottom line is that more immigration favors Democrats; there is no prediction of Democratic electoral ascendancy that doesn t rely on demographic factors as the main engine of the party s dominance. Yet the effects, national and local media have observed, are not limited to electoral patterns.Crime patterns have changed markedly as well.Today, according to the Migration Policy Institute,  about one-fifth of the total population of El Salvador  resides in the United States. The Associated Press reports that,  El Salvador is the top country of birth for immigrants to Virginia.  Indeed, the Migration Policy Institute found that from 2000 to 2008 Virginia saw its Salvadorian immigrant population grow by 13,000 persons. With it, this migration has brought the arrival of the feared Salvadorian gang, Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13.As The Washington Post reported in 2011:  Controlled by ringleaders or  big homies  imprisoned in El Salvador or at large in Central America or Mexico, MS-13  cliques  with such names as the Sailors, Normandy, Peajes, Uniones and Fultons collaborate across the District, Maryland and Virginia. The Post explains that presence of the Salvadorian gang has become so problematic in the Commonwealth that federal officials have been forced to engage in  a targeted, sustained effort to dismantle MS-13 and other violent gangs that threaten our neighborhoods.  Describing one of the gangland slayings, The Post documents how,  Victims included a 14-year-old boy, Giovanni Sanchez, who was stabbed to death and left in the street. Last year, The Washington Post reported:  [A]rmed with two machetes and a sawed-off shotgun, MS-13 gang members allegedly set off in a car  to carry out an assassination at a location as brazen as it was chilling: a Prince William County school. Virginia has become a study in contrasts. The attempted assassination at Prince William County school is only a two-and-a-half hour drive from Colonial Williamsburg, where themed actors create a living museum to throngs of tourists.Each year, the U.S. issues more green cards than the collective population of the 13 colonies the year Virginia s Patrick Henry was born. In a single year, the U.S. will issue five times more green cards than there are members of Daughters of the American Revolution.America s visa programs have also impacted the fiscal landscape as well.As Manhattan Institute Scholar Heather Mac Donald observed in 2005:  The foreign-born Hispanic welfare rate was nearly three times that of native-born whites.  This trend continues for the children of immigrants as well:  Native-born Hispanics collected welfare at over twice the rate as native-born whites.  Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson reported that from 1990 to 2004:  The number of Hispanics with incomes below the government s poverty line [rose] 52 percent; that [represents] almost all (92 percent) of the increase in poor people  Among children, disparities are greater. Over the same period, Hispanic children in poverty [rose] 43 percent; meanwhile, the numbers of black and non-Hispanic white children in poverty declined 16.9 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively. The federal government s policy of resettling poor foreign populations in U.S. communities has presented substantial challenges for educators as well. As the Washington Post reported in 2012 about Fairfax County,  31,5000 students are projected to enroll in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), representing 17 percent of the total county student population and an increase of nearly one-third from last year [2011]. Those numbers have profound implications for the schools system  with 7,652 new students in ESOL this year, that represents an additional $25.3 million. A Washington Post article from last year examining Fairfax county kindergarteners noted,  The white student population is receding and is being replaced with fast-growing numbers of poor students and children of immigrants for whom English is a second language  The demographic changes in Fairfax are likely to have long-term implications for the school system  Schools officials believe that the challenges that come with a less-affluent and less-prepared population will exacerbate the system s struggles with a widening achievement gap for minorities and ballooning class sizes. The Post notes that these changes extend into neighboring Maryland as well:  School systems across the region have experienced rapid increases in the number of Hispanic students as well as the number of pupils who qualify for subsidized meals. In Montgomery County, more than 35 percent of students receive free or reduced-priced meals, compared with 22 percent in 2000. Poor students now account for 68 percent of the kindergarten class in Prince George s County, and 3 in 10 kindergartners this year received additional English instruction. The Post continues:  Elementary school teachers say they spend an increasing amount of their time on remedial education  Grace Choi, a kindergarten language teacher at London Towne [Elementary], said children from poor families often arrive for the first day of school not knowing the alphabet, a standard lesson in preschool. Many cannot differentiate animal words such as cat, lion and cheetah or food words such as potato, eggs and tomato.  The things you think are a given, they don t know,  Choi said. As one school board member told The Post,  We are required to educate their children, and we want to. But there is a cost  There is a cost to having these children in the system. Economist Christine Chmura told the Richmond Times Dispatch that,  some members of Virginia s increasing immigrant population come from a culture in which college education is not encouraged.  In particular, I m referring to the Hispanic population  [Chmura] said.  From this perspective, an increase in immigrants in the state could decrease our educational attainment levels, which has been one of our competitive advantages over other states. While the influence of conservative voters in the Commonwealth continues to diminish, it is ironically Republican officials in Virginia who have led the push to resettle even larger numbers of immigrants inside the state. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, for instance, in the months before his titanic fall from power, engineered the effort to provide more labor to Virginia employers through foreign worker visas.Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has proposed two bills that would add substantially to the millions of foreign visas already annually distributed by the United States. One of those bills, the SKILLS Visa Act, would increase foreign worker visas for technology corporations. The other bill, the Agricultural Guestworker  AG  Act, would increase foreign worker visas issued to food manufacturers who wield substantial influence within the modern Republican Party. Since Goodlatte s foreign workers would arrive on visas, Republican donors who own businesses would be able to legally replace Americans workers with these newcomers.The Washington Post reports the effects of the visas policies supported by Goodlatte in his own district:  Immigrants are a fast-growing part of the landscape and workforce from the Mexicans who pick apples and process poultry to the Indians who work in high-tech and medical fields  Leader s of the state s $3.8 billion poultry industry say they favor immigration reform .  Immigration reform,  as used by The Washington Post in this context, refers to adding greater and greater numbers of foreign workers to the labor pool in a manner employers hope will reduce wages.UVA researchers found that more than one in seven people in Virginia s workforce are foreign-born, and positions in the workforce are more likely to go to them than those born in the state:Labor force participation for natives is at about 65 percent in comparison to more than 73 percent for the foreign-born  A large number of foreign-born workers are employed as computer software engineers, managers, cashiers, accountants and auditors, and retail salespersons, making these highly common occupations for immigrants.The impact mass visa admissions has had on job opportunities for Virginia workers is representative of nationwide trends. For instance, according to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, all net jobs created in the United States from 2000-2014 went to immigrants. In a state where recent races have been decided by razor-thin margins, and where Democrats have relied heavily on pulling huge numbers from the black vote, the addition of so many new voters from post-1970 immigration was keenly felt in the recent governor s race. Following Democratic Gov. Terry McAullife s rise to oldest occupied Executive Mansion in the country, The Atlantic wrote:Terry McAuliffe s narrow win Tuesday to become governor of Virginia was the result of the changing and growing population of Northern Virginia. It was also the product of an electorate just as diverse though not as large as the ones that twice elected Barack Obama  McAuliffe won even though 56 percent of white non-Hispanic voters voted for Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, according to exit polls, thanks to the strength of McAuliffe s support among Latinos and Asians. Together, those two demographic groups contributed more than 50,000 more votes to McAuliffe than to Cuccinelli That s enormously significant, considering that McAuliffe only won by 55,220 votes.The Atlantic continued,  With McAuliffe s victory, Virginia can now be looked at as  sort of a purple state leaning blue,  said [Ruy] Teixeira, co-author of 2002 s The Emerging Democratic Majority. That book predicted that changes in the demographics of the electorate would ultimately swing red states into the blue column; those shifts took some time to show up, but now that they are here they show little sign of abating. In fact, Senator Sen. Marco Rubio, a favorite politician of both media and donors, partnered with Arizona s Sen. John McCain and New York s Chuck Schumer on their proposal to triple green cards. There are currently more than 30 million permanent immigrants inside the U.S who are here on green cards or have already converted their green cards into citizenship: the Gang of Eight s program would have added another 30 million green card holders in the span of one decade. In interviews, Rubio described these immigration expansions euphemistically. He told Rush Limbaugh in 2013 that  our legal immigration system needs to be reformed.  He told Mark Levin in 2013 that  legal immigration is good for America.  He told Sean Hannity in 2014 that he wanted to  modernize our immigration system.  Rubio did not tell Limbaugh, Levin, or Hannity that he wanted to permanently resettle more than 30 million foreign citizens inside the United States within one decade. Rubio was not asked why waves of unskilled immigration from poor countries like El Salvador would be  good for America  as long as these intending migrants were printed green cards on their way into the United States.Rubio has never wavered or altered his stand for exploding net immigration levels. In fact, Rubio recently introduced legislation known as the Immigration Innovation Act   or I-Squared   which would triple wage-depressing H-1B visas and remove university green card caps. The latter Rubio policy would take the current existing policy of importing 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East, and grow it significantly.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jul 27, 2015",transformation el country birth migration policy institute population grow migration arrival gang transformation commonwealth birthplace resting place stronghold result agency evolution thinking result government year government millions world person today change span life millennia census study university phenomenon connection community newspaper detail span generation county explosion population percent county population class fall year child school county left look right classroom percent time child school county classmate language country report percent immigration report percent population department homeland security immigration yearbook percent government product immigration yearbook information nativity immigrant kingdom child percent percent government article post number population decade number percent post state population percent post non whites percent state decade percent state country job retirement voting year year dispensation admission importation college census bureau ten card immigration immigrant population ratio point century president pause button era wage growth pause legislation millions immigration world gusher media recognition effects policy times effects world population shift state landscape times state president win candidate ing immigration voting times minority course landscape increase minority vote share immigration prime times election percent state percent vote percent vote percent vote exit york times policy child immigrant citizenship voting uva percent birth naturalization today fifth age parent article visa margin column report university professor flow country nation electorate favor party report study percent republican percent data study examiner york line immigration prediction ascendancy engine party dominance effects media crime today migration policy institute fifth population press country birth migration policy institute population grow migration arrival gang post district post presence gang commonwealth effort gangland post year boy death street year post gang car assassination location prince county school study assassination prince county school hour drive colonial living museum year population year henry year times revolution visa landscape scholar heather mac welfare rate times whites trend welfare rate born whites post columnist number government line percent percent increase people period poverty percent poverty percent percent government policy post county percent county student population increase third year system year post article year county student population language term school system population system achievement gap class post school region number number county percent percent percent class prince county year instruction post school amount time education grace language teacher elementary day school alphabet lesson preschool cannot cat lion cheetah food potato school board member post cost cost system economist times population culture college education population perspective increase state attainment influence commonwealth push state house majority leader cantor instance fall power effort labor worker congressman bob chairman house committee millions act worker technology bill act worker food influence party post effects district part landscape process poultry tech leader state poultry industry immigration reform immigration reform post context labor pool manner wages people state labor force participation percent comparison percent number computer impact mass visa job instance report center immigration state razor vote addition post immigration governor race terry rise executive mansion country win governor result population product electorate percent non attorney ken exit thanks strength support continued victory sort state blue author majority book electorate column time sign fact senator politician media sen york proposal citizenship gang program card span decade immigration rush immigration system mark levin immigration immigration system levin decade immigration el way stand immigration fact legislation immigration innovation act wage university card policy policy east news
17446,WHY DID HARRY REID LIE ABOUT THE “ACCIDENT” He Had That Left Him Blind In One Eye?,"Dirty Harry must ve jarred something in his head that makes him unaware that he s lying in public. He used to be pretty good at hiding it Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is changing the story about how he sustained those gruesome New Year s Day injuries that have left him blind in one eye.Previously, Reid claimed that an exercise band he was using  broke. I was doing exercises that I ve been doing for many years with those large rubber bands and one of them broke and spun me around and I crashed into these cabinets and injured my eye,  (emphasis added) Reid said at a press conference on January 22.(You can see the video of that press conference here.)But now, in an interview conducted by Fusion (a joint venture between ABC and Univision), excerpts of which have been released today, Reid tells Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that the exercise band  slipped,  rather than  broke. [T]he [elastic band] strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet,  Reid tells Ramos.Reid s latest version of the incident, as told to Ramos, differs from previous versions advanced by his team in another very significant way. Sources familiar with the incident said Reid was exercising in his bathroom, with the exercise band attached to the shower door,  Politico reported on January 22. (emphasis added)As Breitbart News reported previously, that version of the story, almost certainly told to Politico by Reid s staffers with his approval, is not credible.Now, however, Reid tells Ramos a different story. The exercise band was not attached to the shower door in his bathroom, Reid says, but was instead attached to  a big metal hook that came out from the wall  in an unspecified room in his new Nevada home.Here s a partial transcript of the excerpt of the interview released by Fusion:Ramos: You said recently that the accident had nothing to do with your decision to retire.However, we are seeing the consequences of what happened.What really happened?Was it really with an elastic band?Reid: Yeah, I had a big, that thick (Reid gestures with his hands), that I had been using for about four years and I was, you know, trying to maintain my, uh, firmness, and, uh, that was my weight training. I was doing that in my new home here in Nevada and a big metal hook that came out from the wall that was hooked there that the strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard that uh Ramos: It looked like somebody had hit you.Reid: I am so fortunate that, um, it wasn t over just a fraction of this way and hit me in the temple.Ramos: How s your eye?Reid: I am sightless in my right eye.Watch the full video of the excerpts of the Fusion interview here:Ramos then switched gears and asked Reid about  the most difficult moments of [his] 28 years in the Senate. Ramos failed to ask some key follow up questions about Reid s New Year s Day injury incident.For instance, Ramos failed to ask Reid if the accident took place in his bathroom, as Reid s office had previously claimed. According to Reid s latest version of the story, we do not know in which room of his house he now claims he sustained these injuries.Breitbart News has asked Senator Reid s office, which has carefully controlled the release of information about his New Year s Day injuries, to comment on his changed version of the story of his New Year s Day injuries, but has received no reply.Via: Breitbart News",Government News,"Apr 9, 2015",dirty harry something head public minority leader harry story year day eye exercise band rubber eye emphasis press conference video press conference interview fusion venture today anchor exercise band band strap handle oh hand wall interview room face cabinet version incident told team way incident bathroom exercise band door politico emphasis news version story approval story exercise band door bathroom metal hook wall room home transcript excerpt interview fusion accident nothing decision band yeah firmness training home metal hook wall strap handle oh hand wall interview room face cabinet somebody fraction way temple eye sightless eye video fusion interview senate key year day incident instance accident place bathroom office version story room house news senator office release information year day version story year day reply news

9331,"GRAMMYS Nominate All-Black Artists…SNUB Country Music, White Musicians Over “White Supremacy” Concerns…#BoycottGrammys","On Tuesday, the Grammys announced their nominations for the 2018 awards shows, and there are some notable additions and snubs that make it look like the Recording Academy is getting into the business of identity politics.For the first time in 14 years, no country music acts were nominated for the top awards: record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year. Instead, the Grammys took a sharp turn towards honoring hip-hop, R&B, and funk for the top awards.According to Buzzfeed: The night s biggest category, Album of the Year, not only has majority black nominees, but also has no white male nominees for the first time in 19 years.This is also the first year the Record of the Year category is only people of color (with the exception of Justin Bieber, who is featured on Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee s  Despacito ).The Best New Artist category is also majority black this year with SZA, Khalid, and Lil Uzi Vert all gaining nominations. SZA is also this year s most Grammy-nominated woman.Rapper Jay-Z and pop singer Bruno Mars got nods in all three top categories, while rapper/singer Childish Gambino (a.k.a. Donald Glover), rapper Kendrick Lamar, and the coupling of Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee got nods in two of the top three categories. Meanwhile, rapper Logic got nominated for his anti-suicide song  1-800-273-8255  for song of the year.Objectively speaking, Jay-Z, Mars, Gambino, Lamar, Fonsi, and Yankee put out some great product this past year, and with any awards show, there are going to be some snubs. However, it appeared that Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, and Miranda Lambert were all looked over from the top categories because of concerns about white supremacy. Instead, Lorde, the 20-year-old New Zealand singer, and Julia Michaels, the 24-year-old singer from Iowa, were the only pop acts to be nominated for the top categories.  Washington ExaminerSince rap seems to have surpassed country in popularity (well, at least according to the Grammys), in an effort to address  White supremacy , perhaps it s worth taking a look at the black rapper, Snoop Dogg, who shamelessly promotes killing our President and violence against his supporters.

7608, Meet The ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Was Shot In The Back By Her 4-Year-Old While Driving (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS)," Meet Florida resident Jamie Gilt. Everyone say  Hi, Jamie!  Jamie is many things. She s a Ted Cruz supporter. She s a pro-gun advocate who runs a narcissistically-named pro-gun Facebook page called  Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense,  apparently named thusly to mock firearm safety groups. According to her Facebook likes she is an admirer of the Tea Party, she s a horse enthusiast, thinks Hillary Clinton belongs in prison, and admirers the terrorist group who engaged in an armed standoff with the federal government at Bundy Ranch. She s also exactly the sort of person who would leave a loaded gun within arm s reach of a 4-year-old.On Tuesday afternoon, a Putnam County Sheriff s Deputy noticed a woman behaving frantically inside her four-door pickup truck. The officer quickly realized that a woman inside the vehicle had been shot, according to Captain Joseph Wells. The woman explained to the officer that she had been shot by her four-year-old son as he sat in the back seat of the car while the two traveled to her sister s home to pick up a horse. She was shot through the seat and the round went through her back,  Wells said, noting that there were no holes in the back of the truck, which had a horse trailer hitched to the back. The child was not strapped into his booster seat when the deputy found Gilt. There was a booster seat in the back of the vehicle, but however the boy was not strapped in when the deputy got to them,  Wells said. Investigators are working to determine if the child was strapped in at the time of the shooting.Gilt s Facebook profile is filled with posts supporting Ted Cruz, whom she says has the longest history of protecting gun rights among the 2016 field, as well as numerous other right-wing posts ranging from  wildly inaccurate  to  completely f*cking stupid  to  downright insane.  One post in particular has been drawing attention, however. Gily uploaded a photo on March 6   days before the shooting   that depicted two scary criminals who  are breaking into your home to rob you, rape your children, and kill your dog.  The ammosexual gun advocate  remarked that  being dead  might  change their plans. In the comments below the meme, Gilt cheerfully declares that all her children  know how to shoot    something her 4-year-old proved after she left a loaded gun within arm s reach of him.  Even my 4-year-old gets jacked up to target shoot with the .22.,  she wrote in response to someone who praised her  spirit and patriotic attitude. She was shot with a .45-caliber handgun, depriving the world of the most ironic Facebook post of the week.While some may argue that she is a  responsible gun owner  who was simply an unfortunate victim of circumstance and bad luck, that she would never treat a gun like a toy, a tweet from last year reveals that she considers her guns to be exactly that   toys. This is surely a belief she passes down to her children, including the one who shot her.Gilt isn t just an idiot about guns   she s full-blown, Jesus-Christ-What-The-F*ck-Weapons-Grade-Stupid. Here is just a small sampling of her Facebook posts, one of which claims that  it    presumably the Revolution   is  inevitable at this point  because one of the Oregon terrorists was shot after he attempted to pull a gun on law enforcement:      Gilt s pro-gun page is filled with similar bullsh*t: The NRA tells us that people like Gilt are ready to hop into action at a moment s notice to save us from the  bad guys with guns    and Gilt certainly thinks of herself as the mythical  Good Guy With a Gun,  a warrior sent by God herself to defend the citizenry from tyranny. The truth is that she should not have access to weapons if she can not prevent her children from having access to weapons   period.Gilt is in stable condition. The child is in the care of family and the Department of Children and Families has been notified of this completely preventable monumental act of stupidity. Wells says there will be no criminal charges because the shooting is being investigated as  accidental.  However, things may change depending on how the boy managed to get ahold of the weapon.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via Facebook ",News,"March 9, 2016",meet resident gilt everyone hi supporter gun advocate page gilt gun sense safety admirer tea party horse enthusiast prison group standoff government bundy ranch sort person gun arm reach year afternoon county sheriff deputy woman door pickup truck officer woman vehicle woman officer year son seat car home horse seat round back back truck horse trailer child booster seat deputy gilt seat back vehicle boy deputy child time gilt profile history field insane post particular attention photo march days shooting home dog gun advocate gilt something year gun arm reach year shoot response someone spirit attitude caliber handgun world post week gun owner victim circumstance luck gun toy tweet year belief one idiot sampling revolution point gun law enforcement gilt gun page people gilt action moment notice gilt guy gun sent god citizenry truth access access period gilt condition child care family department act stupidity shooting boy weapon report image

8911, ‘This Is A Nightmare’: AL City’s Black Residents Live In Fear Under ‘Confederate Commander’ Police Chief,"The black residents of Dothan, Alabama are, quite literally, living in fear   and with good reason. Their police chief, Steven Parrish, is an open member of a neo- Confederate organization by the name of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Even worse is the fact that officials in Dothan are fully behind Parrish keeping his job as police chief, despite his ties to a clearly racist organization.During a Tuesday government meeting, Dothan Mayor Schmitz allowed just one person in support of Parrish and one against him to speak. Paul Carroll, one of Dothan s black residents, said to the meeting: This would never happen to the Jewish community. You would never see someone who s a neo-Nazi being made chief of police, but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo-Confederate? Carroll also said to local paper the Dothan Eagle: We are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections? I don t (feel safe). Sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority. And Carroll has good reason to feel that way, as Parrish openly says he is a Sons of Confederate Veterans  Commander.  So, it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization, but he has to be a commander. It is also believed (but not proven) that Parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force.Another of the city s black residents, Ruth Nelson, says of Parrish s reign as chief: This is a nightmare. And when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this..they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth. Resident Kevin Saffold alluded to the idea that the city of Dothan would soon be in an uproar if the Parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction: If you don t want this to be another Ferguson, if you don t want civil unrest, if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative, then you should do something about that. I believe in the court system and I believe in justice   I don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field. All of these residents are right, and they have every right to be outraged and afraid. After all, there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist POS.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 7, 2016",fear reason police chief member confederate organization name sons confederate fact job police chief organization government meeting mayor person support meeting community someone chief police somehow community confederate paper eagle trust faith someone feel life privilege minority reason way sons confederate member organization commander men area time force city reign chief nightmare equality idea city uproar situation satisfaction unrest people something court system justice reason board field right justice police department racist image capture story
20712,WATCH: LITTLE HOUSE ON PRAIRIE ACTRESS Runs For Congress…Thinks It’s Okay For Grown Men To Rape 13 Year Old Girls (If Mom’s Home),"America has proven time and time again that liberals in Hollywood can say just about anything. The vile comments actress Melissa Gilbert made about child rape while hosting The View sound more like something a member of ISIS would make, than someone who is running for Congress. It s interesting how the oh-so-easily-offended Left is never offended when one of their own makes a highly controversial comment, but  if the same remarks were made by a conservative, they would be on a 24/7 news loop. Melissa Gilbert, the actress who brought Laura Ingalls Wilder to life in  Little House on the Prairie,  made some comments on a TV show in 2009 that are coming back to haunt her.And they should. Gilbert moved to Michigan from California and is running for Congress in the 8th District, challenging Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester.But running for office opens the door to past skeletons.As a guest host of  The View  seven years ago, Gilbert and the other hosts discussed the arrest of famous movie director and producer Roman Polanski in Switzerland for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl three decades earlier. Polanski had pleaded guilty of assaulting Samantha Geimer in 1977, but fled the U.S. before he was sentenced.Hollywood is loyal to its own, and on the show, Gilbert downplayed Polanski s crime, saying that  it s gray area when momma is in the building,  in reference to reports that Geimer s mother was at the house when the rape occurred.Gilbert went on to say that  the punishment at this point may be excessive.

5895, WATCH: Fox Sports Reporter Taken Off Air After Questioning Intelligence Of Mexicans,"Fox is not only number one with racists, the network is apparently number one at hiring racists as well.After a video of a school valedictorian went viral because Mayte Lara Ibarra told the audience that she is an undocumented immigrant during her speech, a Fox Sports reporter simply could not accept that a Latino is smart enough to be at the top of the class.During a Barstool Rundown associated with Republican nominee Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Fox reporter Emily Austen openly questions the intelligence of Mexicans and made racist comments about Asians and Jews. I didn t even know Mexicans were that smart,  Austen said. She also derided Jews as  stingy  and claimed  the Chinese guy is always the smartest guy in math class. Here s the video via Vimeo. Austen s remarks begin at the 24 minute mark.Well, while racist Trump supporters probably appreciated Austen s comments, they didn t go down well with her bosses at Fox Sports, who promptly removed her from the air for the time being.Fox Sports General Manager Steve Tello condemned Austen s comments and quickly made it clear that Fox Sports had nothing to do with them. We were made aware that Emily Austen appeared in a social media video unaffiliated with Fox Sports in which she made insensitive and derogatory comments. She was not speaking on behalf of Fox Sports, nor do we condone any of the statements she made in the video. Emily has been advised that her comments were unacceptable, and she is not scheduled to appear on any upcoming Fox Sports Florida or Fox Sports Sun broadcasts. These kinds of stereotypical precepts have no place in our society, but this is the kind of America that Donald Trump is hoping to create. As a public media figure, Austen should have known better. It would like someone saying that all blondes are dumb. However, that stereotype appears to be true in Austen s case.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 13, 2016",fox number network number video school audience immigrant speech sports reporter top class nominee trump plan wall border fox reporter intelligence racist stingy guy guy math class video minute mark racist trump sports air time sports manager sports nothing media video sports behalf sports video sports sports sun place society kind trump media figure someone case image
115," Maine Voters Tell Trump To Go F*ck Himself, Expand Medicaid Through Obamacare","Republicans should be downright afraid to try killing Obamacare ever again.As we all know, Donald Trump has been urging Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would strip healthcare from over 20 million Americans.Not only do Trump and his Republican allies want to kill Obamacare, they want to end Medicaid as we know it. Indeed, Medicaid would become a death panel where the state would decide what kind of healthcare people get.As Trump s effort to kill Obamacare gets more desperate, the landmark healthcare program gets more popular, enough so, that a few Republicans have broken ranks to oppose repeal.In fact, Medicaid expansion is so popular that Maine voters overruled Governor Paul LePage s veto on Tuesday via the ballot.According to Reuters,Tuesday s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverageunder Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.And 60 percent of Maine voters approved, clearly rejecting LePage s and Trump s efforts to kill Medicaid and Obamacare.70,000 Mainers will now be eligible for Medicaid coverage and will get the healthcare they need and deserve.This is huge because Maine is often considered politically independent to conservative leaning, meaning that Republicans would be better off abandoning their war on healthcare.If they don t, voters across the country will go to the ballot box and replace them with lawmakers who actually give a damn about them and their health.And Trump could be on the path to being a one-term president, assuming he isn t impeached or arrested before 2020.And he ll have no one to blame but himself. Because people don t like it when politicians try to kill them.Featured Image: White House Photo by Pete Souza",News,"November 8, 2017",trump congress legislation trump allies death panel state kind people trump effort landmark program repeal fact expansion governor veto ballot ballot plan age percent poverty level person family percent trump coverage meaning war country ballot box damn health trump path term president one people image house photo

13915,TRUMP INSIDER REVEALS Donald’s Top Pick For VP: Wants Someone He “can live with for eight years” [VIDEO],"We wholeheartedly approve Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is now the leading candidate to be tapped by Donald Trump as his running mate, a close confidante of Trump tells Newsmax.On Tuesday, Trump told the AP that he has whittled down his choices to 5 or 6 names. I have a list of people that I would like,  Trump revealed in his interview Tuesday.But the name that keeps cropping up as his favorite is Gingrich, a Trump confidante tells Newsmax.Trump has tapped former presidential contender Ben Carson to help pick his running mate. Carson said Tuesday that he is stepping down from that post to focus on the Thursday meeting between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump also announced this week that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will head his transition team.Trump is said to favor Gingrich for several reasons.First, Trump recognizes he is a Washington neophyte and sees in Gingrich someone who can school him in the legislative process and  make nice  with Capitol Hill.Trump admitted to the AP he wants a running mate who can help him  with legislation, getting things through. As Speaker, Gingrich successfully got Bill Clinton to sign legislation abolishing welfare, while agreeing to budget constraints that led to the first balanced budgets in a generation.Trump has other reasons he is leaning toward Gingrich. He is said to personally like him. Rubio, Newsmax reported, has already been eliminated though he lobbied through surrogates for the job. Rubio has denied doing so.Trump also finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich  kind of quirky  and not someone he resonates with, the confidante said.Trump is apparently discarding the traditional approach of picking a running mate to provide geographic or ideological balance to his ticket. Instead he wants someone he  can live with for eight years,  the Trump source said.This concept of a  simpatico ticket,  while rare, occurred when then-Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas turned to then-Sen. Al Gore of nearby Tennessee to run with him in his successful 1992 bid for president.The Fox News commentator was an early defender of Trump in the GOP primary.Here is Newt Gingrich endorsing Donald J. Trump only yesterday: Donald values loyalty,  the source said, and Gingrich has been loyal.Trump told the AP that he also is looking for a candidate who has held office and been under the public microscope. For the most part, they ve been vetted over the last 20 years,  he explained to the AP.Gingrich has had such vetting, and survived a bitter, though unsuccessful run for president in 2012 against Mitt Romney.Gingrich is also considered one of the best communicators in the party, and Trump is placing great emphasis on who can go toe-to-toe against Hillary Clinton s running mate in upcoming debates.Via: NewsMax ",politics,"May 12, 2016",house speaker newt candidate trump trump trump list people trump interview name favorite trump trump contender ben mate post meeting trump house speaker trump week jersey transition team trump neophyte someone school process hill trump mate legislation speaker bill legislation welfare budget generation trump job kind quirky someone trump approach mate balance ticket someone trump source concept ticket bill gore bid president news commentator defender trump primary trump yesterday source trump candidate office microscope part run president party trump emphasis toe mate
2846, BUSTED: Trump’s Senior WH Staff Have Email Accounts On A Private Server (DETAILS),"When Donald Trump was a running for office, he and his conservative followers repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state. Hypocrisy, thy name is GOP. Newsweek is reporting that senior Trump administration staffers have active accounts on a Republican National Committee email system. Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner, Sean Spicer and Steve Bannon are among those who are using the system (rnchq.org)   the same one the George W. Bush administration was accused of using in order to evade transparency rules after claiming to have  lost  22 million emails.What they re doing is not illegal but it is ironic.But after then-candidate Donald Trump and the Republicans repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state, the new White House staff risks repeating the same mistake that dogged the Democrat s presidential campaign. They also face a security challenge: The RNC email system, according to U.S. intelligence, was hacked during the 2016 race.  They better be careful after making such a huge ruckus over the private email over at the State Department,  says former Bush administration lawyer Richard Painter.And by the way, Hillary Clinton s server use did not violate the law. Still yet, last July, an informal adviser to Donald Trump s presidential campaign called for Hillary Clinton s execution. Al Baldasaro said that Clinton  should be put in the firing line and shot for treason  because of her use of private email server.It s not known yet how the Trump staffers are using the RNC email addresses, however, if they are actively using them then they are subject to the  Disclosure Requirement For Official Business Conducted Using Electronic Messaging Accounts. If White House staffers have already used the RNC emails system for White House work, they must copy or forward those communications into the government system within 20 days.But wait, there s more!The New York Times is reporting that Trump is still using his  old, unsecured Android phone  to take calls and tweet despite  protests from some of his aides. Last night when Trump tweeted that he would send in the Feds  to Chicago, he was using his Android. As for the White House phones, Trump said they are  the world s most secure system,  adding,  The words just explode in the air.

1538, Trump Just Made His 2 Most DUNDERHEADED Moves Yet After Firing Comey (DETAILS),"As if firing FBI Director James Comey wasn t stupid enough, Trump has gone and driven two more nails into his own coffin this evening. First, he hired an outside law firm to send a certified letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that heard testimony from James Clapper and Sally Yates on May 8, regarding the Russia probe.Second, he s meeting with Vladimir Putin s top diplomat to the U.S., Sergey Lavrov, in the White House Wednesday morning. The Associated Press says that this could be a signal that our relationship with Russia is improving again, but in the wake of the clusterfuck that was Trump s entire Tuesday, this does not look good at all.First, the law firm and the letter. Trump wants the letter to Sen. Graham to claim that he has no connections to Russia.Seriously.He s hired an outside law firm to draft and send a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham claiming that he has no connections business or otherwise to Russia. Because obviously.But wait! This move achieves the impossible by getting even more ridiculous than that! Sean Spicer briefed the White House press corps on this development, and said: The president, obviously, was aware of Senator Graham s suggestion after he made it today and he s fine with that. He has no business in Russia. He has no connections to Russia. So he welcomes that.In fact, he is already charged a leading law firm in Washington, D.C., to send a certified letter to Senator Graham to that point that he has no connections to Russia. If he knows he s got no connections at all to Russia, and he knows he s completely innocent of all these allegations, then why hire an outside law firm to send a letter to Sen. Graham reiterating that? That s not what someone who s sure of their innocence does.Now, his meeting with Lavrov is taking place after Lavrov meets with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Both meetings will supposedly focus on stabilizing Syria   the Trump administration seems to think that we need to work with Russia to accomplish anything there. But, as the AP notes in their story: [T]he meeting will be impossible to separate from the Trump administration s unfolding political drama in Washington, where FBI and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Kremlin related to last year s presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Moscow of meddling to help Trump s chances of victory. That, combined with this letter he s sending to Sen. Graham (and we have to wonder exactly how such a letter is going to prove that he s got no connections to Russia at all), just looks really, really bad. In fact, it s starting to look like the world is about to come crashing down around him.Featured image by Olivier Douliery   Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017",director trump coffin evening law firm letter graham senate subcommittee testimony russia probe second diplomat house morning press signal relationship russia wake law firm letter trump letter graham law firm letter graham business move spicer house press corps development president senator graham suggestion today business russia fact law firm letter graham point law firm letter someone sure innocence meeting place secretary state rex trump administration russia anything story meeting trump administration drama collusion trump campaign kremlin year election intelligence victory letter graham letter fact world image pool
1641, Team Trump Knew Flynn Broke The Law And Hired Him Anyway (DETAILS),"While most Americans did not know about Michael Flynn s ties to Turkey, Team Trump did. When they were vetting the former general, they did learn of Flynn s work for both Turkey and Russia. They knew he had violated the law and the U.S. Constitution and they hired him to be the National Security Advisor anyway.MSNBC s Rachel Maddow said this on her show on Friday night,  NBC News has learned from sources close to the Trump-Russia investigation that both the Trump transition and the White House did do a background check on Flynn.  She went on to say that the vetting Team Trump did of Flynn was done  very casually. The new reporting by NBC News mirrors the claims Flynn has been making for some time that he and his lawyers were upfront with the vetting team about the lobbying he was doing on behalf of the Turkish government.For its part, the White House has taken to blaming the Obama administration. Flynn worked as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). His job at the DIA did require he receive a top secret clearance but it is important to note that he was fired from that job in 2014 (he started there in 2011), this was a full year before he was scheduled to retire.This week, Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated that the transition team relied on the vetting that had been done by the Obama Administration. The timing of this is important to note because Flynn did not start his consulting work until after he left the DIA. The vetting he received prior to that role, which is what gave him his clearance would not have shown his ties to Turkey or Russia because that work hadn t happened yet.Members of the military are barred from working for foreign governments for life, unless they receive Congressional approval. The reason is that they can be called back to duty at any time and working for a foreign government could cause a conflict of interest.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017",team trump learn work turkey russia law constitution security advisor show night news trump russia investigation trump transition house background check team trump news time team behalf government part house administration director defense intelligence agency job clearance job year week press secretary spicer transition team administration timing work role clearance work military life approval reason duty time government conflict interest image mark

7989, Texas Father Disowns Teenage Daughter For Her ‘Sickening’ Interracial Relationship (TWEETS),"It has been nearly fifty years since the landmark Supreme Court ruling, Loving v. Virginia, that made interracial marriages (relationships) legal in the United States, but apparently some people are unaware of the ruling. A teenager in Texas recently tweeted an infuriating letter from her dad explaining the reason why he s disowning her: the relationship she was in with an African-American male.Stephanie Hicks, 19, is dating a black male and apparently this pissed her father off so much that he disowned her. In a letter she posted on Twitter, her father says: My belief is that interracial relationships are despicable. Vulgar and reprehensible. There s nothing worse than a half-black, and I m crushed that my own daughter has entered into such a disgusting relationship Mistakes can be forgiven, but you have willingly and consciously chosen a lifestyle of sickening choices, and I won t tolerate it. Her father then tells her that is she does not break up with her boyfriend, Nike, that she is not welcome in his life any longer: If you choose this black kid over your parents fill [suitcases] up and leave my house Change your name as soon as possible, because I won t have any association with you. Ever. First of all, as a parent, I am disgusted by this piece of garbage who has the audacity to call himself  Dad.  If he s are willing to disown his child over who they are dating, he never had any business raising a kid in the first place.Secondly, it is 2016 and no matter how much the GOP would like us all to believe racism is dead, it is clearly alive and thriving in the state of Texas. Her father called her relationship  sickening  but the only thing sickening about any of this is that guy s vile, hatred for a person because of the melanin he has in his skin. It is sad that this is even a battle that needs to be fought still, but it does.Like Stephanie, I am super white. I m so white that you could all use me to guide your way through a dark forest and my husband isn t white at all. I also live in the South, just like her and know what it is like to have people stare at me with disgust because my husband and child are naturally tan. Seriously. In 2016.America really has changed that much in the last fifty years because we have an entire political party that campaigns on platforms of racism and hate   hell, just look at Donald Trump. And this is going to continue to be a problem until we all step up and fight back. That means that we all have to vote for progressive candidates who want to move this country forward, not back.Hopefully, Stephanie takes this and uses it to become an even stronger human being.

9388,LAVAR BALL: Here’s Why President Trump Was Under No Legal Obligation To Help Release Your Shoplifting Son From Chinese Prison,"Before Lavar Ball, the ungrateful father of accused criminal, and UCLA basketball player, LiAngelo Ball, goes off on a public rant about how unappreciative he for President Trump s help, when he interceded on behalf of his son and 2 other UCLA basketball players, who were caught shoplifting at a Louis Vuitton store in China, he may want to consider, that without the help of President Trump, his son could be sitting in a Chinese prison for the next 10 years.Lavar Ball might also want to consider that President Trump was under no obligation to ask President Xi to get involved in the public relations nightmare that took place while our President was a guest in China, to help negotiate their release, and here s why   Days after President Donald Trump touted his role in the release of three UCLA basketball students who were arrested in China, LaVar Ball, the father of one of those players, suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses.    LaVar Ball, father of UCLA player with  sticky fingers Law Newz   Our Tweeter-in-Chief lashed out on Twitter Sunday after Ball, a businessman, and ex-basketball player, downplayed POTUS  role in helping release son LiAngelo Ball from Chinese custody.Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 I should have left them in jail,  Trump wrote. That s a hell of thing to tweet, and it grabbed a lot of attention. Outlets like Mediaite, The NY Times, Fox News, and ESPN were all over it. But as with many things in this administration, it s always helpful to review a president s role in situations like this.To recap, we have three Americans UCLA basketball players LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley arrested by Chinese authorities for alleged shoplifting. Trump took credit for their return to the states, saying he asked the country s president Xi Jinping for help. Now we have that same president saying he should ve done nothing.What does it mean if provable spite motivated a president s decision to refrain from helping an American held in custody on foreign soil? Law&Crime reached out to Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman for his take on the matter and asked if such behavior, or something like it, could be impeachable. Not impeachable,  Feldman wrote in an email.  He was under no duty to help and no duty to be nice about it after the fact.

22068,STAR WARS 2.0: Washington’s Battle to Fund Space Warfare,"21st Century Wire says In 1983, US President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a space-based anti-missile system which came to be known as  Star Wars.  At the time, SDI was meant to give the US a nuclear first-strike against advantage against its geopolitical rival the Soviet Union by using various weaponized technologies including lasers, to intercept Soviet ICBM missiles in space. In the end, the program proved to be too costly, too complicated for a practical role out, and ineffective against non-space faring weapons like cruise missiles, submarine based missile batteries and long range bombers.  Now in 2017, as the Cold War is being re-heated again, the West is potentially looking at the complete militarization of outer space. This time the US nemesis is both Russia and China. But what really driving this new  space race  agenda?Consortium News Exclusive: As a backdrop to the Russia-gate hysteria and the heightened fear of China is a budget war over how much U.S. taxpayer money to pour into space warfare, explains Jonathan Marshall By Jonathan MarshallThere s a civil war being fought on our nation s soil, right in our capital. It pits the Secretary of Defense and senior generals against a bipartisan band of militant legislators who accuse the Pentagon of standing pat while Russian and China work to achieve military superiority over the United States in space.No doubt these bureaucratic warriors will eventually call a truce. But in the meantime, the American people will almost certainly become less secure and more indebted (in budget terms) as a result of both sides  macho posturing for new warfighting capabilities in space (differing mostly on how far and how fast to go).Eager congressional advocates of space warfare have attached an amendment to the House defense authorization bill requiring the Pentagon to create a new U.S. Space Corps to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard by 2019. Currently, the Air Force oversees most space warfare projects.The amendment has sent senior Pentagon leadership into a tizzy. Secretary of Defense James Mattis  strongly  urged Congress to rescind the requirement, stating in a letter that  it is premature to add additional organization and administrative tail to the department at a time I am trying to reduce overhead. Similarly, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson protested that the proposal will simply  add more boxes to the organization chart.  Meanwhile, Gen. John W. Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, insisted that his service has space matters well in hand. (He should be happy   the Pentagon recently raised his position to a 4-star rank.)Upping the AnteIn response, Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Strategic Forces subcommittee, announced that he was  pissed  and  outraged  at the Air Force for fighting the new Space Command, saying its obstructionism would  set back efforts to respond to adversaries and space threats  and allow Russia and China  to surpass us soon. The Air Force leadership would have us trust them: I don t think so,  Rogers sneered, as if speaking about the Russians.  They just need a few more years to rearrange the deck chairs: I don t think so. This is the same Air Force that got us into the situation where the Russians and the Chinese are near-peers to us in space.  He vowed,  We will not allow the status quo to continue. Behind all the fiery argumentation lies a bipartisan consensus that the United States must sharply increase its spending on the militarization of space to maintain global supremacy. Gen. Raymond applauded Congress for recognizing the  national imperative  of his mission to  normalize, elevate, and integrate space as a war-fighting domain. Secretary Wilson published an op-ed column last month on her new initiatives to  develop space airmen who have the tools, training, and resources to fight when   not if   war extends into space.  She fully expects Congress to follow through on her request for a 20 percent increase in Air Force space funding. (Total military spending on space, including non-Air Force programs like the National Reconnaissance Office, came to about $22 billion last year.)What s driving all this activity   aside from baser motives of bureaucratic advantage and financial gain  are  intelligence assessments  that  China and Russia have aggressive programs to both demonstrate and produce eventual operational capability to . . . attack our space assets across the spectrum,  in the words of David Hardy, acting deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for Space. While we re not at war in space, I don t think we can say we re exactly at peace, either, said Navy Vice Adm. Charles A. Richard, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, in March. Gen. John Hyten, head of the Pentagon s Strategic Command, recently declared that the United States needs not only a good defense, but  an offensive capability to challenge  space threats from Russia and China.The High Stakes in SpaceThe stakes are potentially huge because the United States uses space for all manner of command, control, and intelligence missions, not to mention civilian applications. Orbiting satellites provide near-real-time images of conflict zones, sense missile launches and nuclear tests, provide precise positioning coordinates to guide weapons systems, and route secure communications to remote regions of the globe Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE SPACE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Space FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"July 14, 2017",century wire president defense initiative space missile system star time strike advantage rival union space end program role space cruise missile range war west militarization space time russia china space race agenda consortium news backdrop russia gate hysteria fear china budget war taxpayer money space warfare war nation soil right capital secretary defense band pentagon pat work superiority space doubt truce people budget result sides space space warfare amendment house defense authorization bill pentagon space corps army navy air force coast guard air force space warfare amendment pentagon leadership secretary defense congress requirement letter organization tail department time air force secretary heather proposal organization chart meanwhile gen commander air force space command service space hand pentagon position star rank response rep mike republican chairman subcommittee air force space command obstructionism space russia china air force leadership speaking deck air force situation space status quo argumentation consensus spending militarization space supremacy gen congress imperative mission elevate space war domain secretary column month space training war space congress request percent increase air force space spending space air force reconnaissance office year activity advantage gain intelligence china russia demonstrate capability space assets spectrum hardy air force space war space peace vice deputy commander command march gen head pentagon command defense capability space russia space manner command control intelligence time conflict sense missile secure globe story consortium space news century wire space subscribe member
2893, Trump Tells Corporate CEOs He Will Slash 75 Percent Of Regulations That Protect Workers And Environment,"Donald Trump just promised Corporate America that they ll be able to rape the environment and screw over their workers at will after his administration is done killing every regulation in the book.During a meeting with corporate executives on Monday, Trump told them that he will cut their tax rate  massively  by up to more than half the current rate of 35 percent, which would significantly reduce revenues the federal government will take in.In short, that means Trump is copying what Republicans did in Kansas, a move that has destroyed the state s economy while blowing up the budget with massive deficits.Trump also said that if a corporation wants to build a factory his team will expedite the process to make sure it happens even if doing so threatens vital habitats.He then stated his intention to wipe out  75 percent or more  of the current regulations that protect workers and the environment. The regulations are going to be cut massively,  Trump said.  And the taxes are going to be cut way down. But he insisted that workers and the environment will somehow still be protected despite the loss of the regulations that actually do protect them.Here s the video via Facebook.Donald Trump just became even more of a threat to workers, the environment, and the nation s fiscal health.Most of these regulations exist for a reason and we should not just be cutting because Trump heard a sob story from a greedy corporate CEO.But he s apparently going to do it anyway and that means American workers can expect to see regulations that protect their safety, wages, and rights disappear and then when they get home they ll have to deal with the dirty air and poisoned water that results from Trump s repel of environmental regulations.Every voter who sat home pouting or voted for a third party because Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee should be ashamed of themselves. Because in the end, while Trump is going to be responsible for our nation s destruction, you are to blame for enabling him to do so in the first place.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 23, 2017",trump environment screw administration regulation book meeting trump tax rate rate percent government trump move state economy budget trump corporation factory team process intention percent environment way environment loss video trump threat environment nation health reason story safety wages disappear home dirty air water repel voter home pouting party nominee end trump nation destruction place image
15224,"SHOCKING! EVIDENCE SHOWS WHY OBAMA IS HEART OF VIOLENT #BlackLivesMatter COP KILLING, ANTI-WHITE MOVEMENT"," There will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  -Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Barack Hussein Obama s pastor for over 20 yearsWhen the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) was first formed right after George Zimmerman s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013, most overlooked the true intentions of the group beyond their calls for  justice . Fast forward to today and it can no longer be overlooked that their calls for justice now result in retaliatory violence against those whom they believe are the oppressors, namely those being white people in general and police officers specifically. By tracing the origins of the organization back to its philosophical formation in the 1960 s, we can begin to see how BLM is rooted in the radical ideological beliefs espoused by none other than President Barack Obama.Before we get to that point though, it is crucial for us to understand that BLM was founded by three militant feminists by the name of Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opel Tometi.While each played their part in contributing to the creation of the group, Garza is the driving force as she detailed the philosophy behind BLM in her October 2014 article titled A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Garza writes the following in regards to BLM s philosophy: Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement. The key takeaway from Garza s statement is found in the last two sentences primarily as she notes that BLM was created with the intention to  (re)build the Black liberation movement.  The reason this statement is of utter importance is because it ties directly to the idea of Black Liberation theology, which was the doctrine taught to Obama for over twenty years at his church in Chicago made famous by Obama s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Black Liberation theology was first formed on July 31, 1966. In an article published by NPR it is noted that: Black liberation theology originated on July 31, 1966, when 51 black pastors bought a full page ad in the New York Times and demanded a more aggressive approach to eradicating racism echo[ing] the demands of the black power movement. What is often overlooked in the formation of the group is the linkage between the Nation of Islam and Black Liberation theology as Wright s mentor and founder of Black Liberation theology James Cone credited Malcolm X with  shaking him out of his theological complacency. Stanley Kurtz of National Review highlighted this synergy in noting that according to Cone,  The black intellectual s goal is to aid in the destruction of America as he knows it.  Such destruction requires both black anger and white guilt. The black-power theologian s goal is to tell the story of American oppression so powerfully and precisely that white men will  tremble, curse, and go mad, because they will be drenched with the filth of their evil , wrote Cone.In an excerpt from Stanley Kurtz s piece drawing on the influence of Malcom X on Black Liberation theology, Kurtz states:So what exactly is  black power ? Echoing Malcolm X, Cone defines it as  complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary.  Open, violent rebellion is very much included in  whatever means ; like the radical anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon, on whom he sometimes draws, Cone sees violent rebellion as a transformative expression of the humanity of the oppressed Theologically,  Cone affirms,  Malcolm X was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil. The false Christianity of the white-devil oppressor must be replaced. Couple these words to Obama s pastor Jeremiah Wright s statement that  there will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  and you can begin to understand that the rhetoric behind Black Lives Matter that blames  white privilege  for virtually everything is rooted in Black Liberation theology. However Wright was radicalized , notes Bud White of NoQuarterUSA,  it is clear that he consciously appropriated the language and tenor of the Nation of Islam.  White documents the following:Wright s statement that 9/11 was deserved retribution ( We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans America s chickens are coming home to roost ) is a perfect echo of Malcolm X s statement that  The assassination of Kennedy is a result of that way of life and thinking. The chickens came home to roost.  Although it appears that Wright began his focus on Black Liberation Theology sometime after 1966, his racial attitudes and rhetoric have imitated that of NOI since at least 1970. Wright s blaming the United States for creating AIDS to kill minorities is but just one example of his thinking being in lockstep with NOI.The Nation of Islam and Black Liberation Theology are two doors to the same room.Black Liberation Theology is a  palatable  form of  Christian  black nationalism. The fiery anti-American, race-baiting words of Wright, Cone, and others behind the theology of Black Liberation  are from the same philosophical cauldron as the Nation of Islam , concludes White.From the beliefs that served as Obama s bedrock foundation for his ideology, is it any wonder that today that the radicals behind Black Lives Matter and the Nation of Islam are allowed a free pass to incite as much hatred and retaliation against those they deem are the oppressors? As violence has ramped up in the first half of 2015 in targeted assassinations against police officers, little to no coverage by the media is given to a meeting that was hosted by the White House on December 1st.On December 1, 2014, Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder met with seven Black and Latino organizers   from Ferguson, Mo.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; and New York City, who had been leading the ongoing actions to disrupt the status quo. In an article posted by the website FergusonAction, it is explained that during this meeting activists such as Ashley Yates were given the platform by the White House in order to reaffirm their belief that  most violence in our (their) community is coming from the police departments, and something needs to be done about it.  On December 20th  something was done about it  as two uniformed NYPD officers were assassinated in their marked car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in what Brinsley himself boasted as an act of retaliation for the death of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.Ashley Yates, BLM Organizer who created t-shirt praising cop killer, Assata ShakurThe reason Yates is emphasized here is because she, like BlackLivesMatter founder Alicia Garza, praise cop killer and former Black Liberation member Assata Shakur as a martyr for their cause.Alicia Garza, BLM founderYates even created T-shirts and hoodies that read  ASSATA TAUGHT ME  in a reference to Shakur that has become part of BLM s iconography. The fact that the president would even entertain the thought of meeting with those like Yates and other  activists  who hold cop killers as icons for their movement further goes to show how Obama s belief in Black Liberation theology, primarily that retaliation and violence should be used to further their cause, has never left him. Why else would Obama have met with these  activists  unless he was sympathetic to their plight, which given the fact that Obama spent over twenty years of his life listening to Jeremiah Wright s sermons, he very much is. Since this meeting though, what cannot be dismissed is the fact that violence in the form of targeted assassinations of both white people and police officers, have ramped up.And it will only get worse the longer we continue to allow Obama s Department of Justice to remain idly complicit.Via: Politically Short",politics,"Sep 8, 2015",peace whites reverend pastor organization matter death martin group justice today justice retaliatory violence people organization formation none president point name part creation group force philosophy article movement philosophy matter contribution people police nationalism people men front movement queer folk background matter queer gender spectrum liberation liberation movement statement intention liberation movement reason statement importance idea liberation theology doctrine taught church pastor liberation theology article liberation theology page ad york times approach racism echo power movement formation group linkage nation liberation theology mentor founder liberation theology complacency review synergy goal destruction destruction anger guilt power goal story oppression men curse filth cone excerpt piece influence liberation theology power cone emancipation people oppression people violent rebellion anti theorist fanon cone rebellion expression humanity man devil devil oppressor pastor statement peace whites whiteness rhetoric privilege everything liberation theology language tenor nation wright statement retribution state terrorism south echo statement assassination result way life wright focus liberation theology rhetoric example nation liberation theology room liberation theology form nationalism fiery race cone theology liberation nation bedrock foundation ideology wonder today matter nation pass retaliation violence half police coverage media meeting house vice president joe attorney holder mo york city status quo article meeting platform house order belief violence community police something needs something car act retaliation death brown garner york police organizer shirt killer reason founder praise cop killer liberation member martyr cause reference part fact president thought meeting movement belief liberation theology retaliation violence cause plight fact spent life meeting cannot fact violence form people police department justice
7518, Johnny Depp GOES OFF On Donald Trump: He’s ‘A BRAT!’ (VIDEO),"Johnny Depp will not be voting for Donald Trump, judging from the award-winning actor s comments during a recent sit-down Q&A at Arizona State University on Saturday.The Q&A was focused around the methods Depp uses in his acting, but the actor couldn t help but go off on a Trump rant while speaking with theoretical physicist and Arizona State University s Origins Project founder Lawrence Krauss about  humanity in madness. Depp didn t mince his words as he railed against the GOPer, calling him a  brat.  Depp began by stating that he didn t think the candidate s offensive behavior was merely a result of  him being a rich kid.  Depp added,  There s something creative about him in a sense of bullydom  before ultimately coming to the conclusion that  What he is, I believe, is a brat. Depp also commented on Trump s raunchy, brash language by stating how interesting it was to follow the absurdity of where his sentences might travel.  Depp continued: Reagan back in the day,  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall!  Donald Trump,  I m going to build a wall. And all of my billions are not going to have to pay for it. Because you know why? Mexico is going to pay for it.' What follows after those thoughts is one of the most amazing, dead-on Trump impressions by the actor, which the audience went absolutely wild for. You can watch Depp go in on Trump below:Depp has attacked Trump before, and seems to have his impression of him down pat. Last month, Depp impersonated the business mogul in a hilarious Funny Or Die video that was based on Trump s bestselling book The Art of the Deal.Depp is just the latest person to join the droves of celebrities speaking out against Trump. Just this weekend, singer John Legend also publicly railed against the Republican front runner when he called Trump out on Twitter. Trump has also recently been condemned by Louis C.K., Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King  and we don t blame these celebrities for doing everything they can to wake Americans up. As long as Trump has a chance at the White House, America is in big trouble and we need everyone to speak up against him.

22439,‘Anti-Russia’ Escalation? Plans for New US Marine Base in Norway,"21st Century Wire says It seems that US anti-Russian rhetoric has translated into action as new plans for NATO to continue its march eastward have emerged.According to Norwegian News sources, the US Marine Corps will establish a new base in northern Norway as early as January.Their reason:  To improve their ability respond rapidly to potential Russian aggression. Here is a video of US Marines live-fire training in Norway last winter:.  If approved by the Norwegian government, a Marine Corps presence in Norway will increase NATO s ability to rapidly aggregate and employ forces in northern Europe. Why would NATO need to deploy rapid reaction forces into northern Europe? Is Washington planning for war?More from RT  RTAs soon as early January, Norway may permit the US Marine Corps to deploy troops on its soil, furthering NATO s goal of placing more military assets on Russia s border, according to local media.A rotating force of 300 US troops would be deployed in Vaernes, an air station outside the central Norwegian city of Trondheim about 100 kilometers from Russia, as part of what NATO claims to be an effort to deter  Russian aggression,  Norway s Adresseavisen newspaper reported.READ MORE: Norway mulls US troop deployment on its soil   Defense MinistryThe plan is yet to be approved by the Norwegian Parliament, where several parties oppose it for various reasons. Some politicians say inviting the US marines would violate the spirit of Norway s 1949 commitment not to host foreign troops, while others say the government should not outsource its national security to the United States. Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide is to address the MP s concerns before they vote.Meanwhile, US officials say maintaining 300 Marines in Norway would be beneficial.READ MORE NATO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NATO FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 19, 2016",century wire rhetoric action march eastward news corps base reason ability respond aggression video fire training winter government corps presence ability reaction war soil goal assets russia border media force air station city russia part effort aggression newspaper deployment soil defense plan parliament spirit commitment government security defense minister news century wire work member
1368, Monica Lewinsky Wrote An Obituary For Roger Ailes And It Was BRUTAL,"Last week, disgraced former Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, died. I know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead, but Ailes was toxic. He was a misogynist, a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic. Without Roger Ailes, we would likely not have had two illegal wars and we wouldn t have BLOTUS Trump.For some, though, their toxic relationship with Ailes was far more personal. One notable example of a life he ruined was Monica Lewinsky, who, to this day, is best known as the woman who gave Bill Clinton a blow job. Lewinsky penned her own obituary for Ailes, and there was no reverence. There was resentment and a whole lot of truth. This is not another obituary for Roger Ailes,  Lewinsky wrote,  who died last week 10 months after being ousted at Fox News. It is, I hope, instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed   a culture that affected me profoundly and personally. Hard to deny that. Thanks to Fox News, a consensual affair suddenly became the scandal of the decade   it was the story that was supposed to undo a presidency. Without Lewinsky, Fox News might not be Fox News today.Some experts have noted that viewers found Fox for the first time because of the crisis. John Moody, a Fox executive editor, reflected on that period:  The Lewinsky saga put us on the news map.  As he put it in another interview:  Monica was a news channel s dream come true. But amid that, Fox created the culture of mean. They somehow managed to portray Bill Clinton as a predator (ironic given the culture at Fox News) while portraying Lewinsky as unworthy of a powerful man s attentions.Their dream was my nightmare. My character, my looks and my life were picked apart mercilessly. Truth and fiction mixed at random in the service of higher ratings. My family and I huddled at home, worried about my going to jail   I was the original target of Ken Starr s investigation, threatened with 27 years for having been accused of signing a false affidavit, obstructing justice, suborning perjury and other crimes   or worse, me taking my own life. Meantime, Mr. Ailes huddled with his employees at Fox News, dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy.Lewinsky lamented the fact that it wasn t only Fox, and that Fox changed the media landscape. Even MSNBC was committed to almost non-stop coverage of the scandal that shouldn t have been. The internet, though, made it much, much worse.Just as television news was devolving into a modern coliseum, the internet came along and compounded this culture of shame and vitriol. Remember: The story of my affair was not broken by The Washington Post, The New York Times or the networks, but online by the Drudge Report. The comments on television and online were excruciating. I ceased being a three-dimensional person. Instead I became a whore, a bimbo, a slut and worse. Just days after the story broke, Fox asked its viewers to vote on this pressing question: Is Monica Lewinsky an  average girl  or a  young tramp looking for thrills ?Lewinsky isn t cheering for Fox News to be cancelled. In fact, she praised them for firing Ailes and Bill O Reilly, both of whom were accused of being serial sexual harassers. She also said she believes that credible conservative voices should be heard, that it s an important part of a healthy democracy. However, Ailes helped create the current cruel and toxic political environment, and for that, he won t be missed.Featured image of Monica Lewinsky via Bryan Bedder/Getty Images | Featured image of Roger Ailes via Handout/Getty Images.",News,"May 22, 2017",week fox news chief roger misogynist racist information demographic roger trump toxic relationship example life day woman bill blow job obituary reverence resentment lot truth obituary roger week news culture culture thanks news affair scandal decade story presidency news news today fox time crisis moody executive editor period saga news map interview news channel dream fox culture mean bill predator culture news man dream life truth fiction mixed random service family home target investigation affidavit justice perjury life news exploit tragedy fact fox media landscape coverage scandal television news coliseum culture shame story affair york times drudge report television person whore slut days story question girl tramp news fact bill part democracy cruel environment image bedder image roger handout

870," Republican Stuns CNN Host, Wants To Starve Americans To Pay For Trump’s Border Wall (VIDEO)","As if the Republican Party couldn t possibly look any worse thanks to Donald Trump s exploding Russia scandal, some of the party s top members are hellbent on destroying conservatives  reputation even further.On Wednesday morning, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) went on CNN to propose a heartless, revolting solution to getting Trump s border wall paid for. King is apparently accepting Mexico s refusal to pay for Trump s moronic border wall (even as Trump still insists that the country will pay) and has come up with another solution   cutting food assistance to low-income Americans! And while he s at it, he d also like to slash Planned Parenthood funding.This disgusting suggestion came up when Alisyn Camerota asked King if he would be  comfortable with providing $1.6 billion of taxpayer money not from Mexico to bill that wall?  This question was prompted by the House Republicans  threat to Democrats on Tuesday, where they suggested a government shutdown if $1.6 billion for the border wall wasn t included in the 2018 budget. King responded: Absolutely yes and more. And I d throw another $5 billion on the pile, and I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood s budget. And the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations. Camerota, of course, was speechless. She did a double take and asked: You want to take food from people who are on the lowest rung in terms of the nation s safety net and their children, in terms of foot stamps you re happy to take money from them in order to give the $1.6 billion for the border wall? King tried to defend himself, stating that the border wall would create jobs. Then, he jumped to the school lunch program that Michelle Obama had created. He said: I would just say let s limit it to that anybody who wants to have food stamps, it s up to the school lunch program, that s fine. You can watch King turn into an absolute piece of sh*t below:These food stamps   provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   are responsible for assisting 45 million people. Trump has already proposed that this program be cut 25% over the next 10 years, and King wants to cut it even more to support an ineffective border wall that most Americans strongly oppose. By cutting SNAP and Planned Parenthood funding, King is solidifying himself as a conservative who doesn t care about low-income Americans. He s truly living up to the GOP s reputation.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",News,"July 12, 2017",party thanks russia scandal party reputation morning rep heartless solution wall king refusal trump border wall trump country solution food assistance income parenthood suggestion king taxpayer money bill question house threat government shutdown border wall budget king throw pile half parenthood budget rest food people course take food people rung nation safety net foot money order border wall border wall school lunch program anybody food school lunch program piece food nutrition assistance program snap people program border wall snap parenthood king income reputation image
2244, Obamacare Vs Trumpcare Meme DESTROYS GOP’s Health Care Replacement Fail (TWEETS),"Donald Trump and the Republican Party s push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) was met with protests and resistance all around the country. Despite being well aware that their  replacement  would be stripping millions of Americans (especially the ill and lower-income citizens) of their life-saving, affordable health insurance, the GOP has continued to push forward with their horrible idea   and now they re getting annihilated for it on the internet.On Monday, Republicans released a draft bill of their Obamacare replacement  the American Health Care Act. As expected with anything that Trump or the Republican Party does, it was not received well and is already considered a massive failure just 24 hours after its release. To commemorate yet another major fail by the GOP and its corrupt, deranged leader, the internet came to the rescue and tore the new replacement apart   by making it a meme!Here s some of the best Obamacare vs. Trumpcare memes we could find, which makes the GOP s latest f**k up just a little more tolerable:          Out of all of them, this one is sure to make Trump explode and throw a Twitter temper tantrum, as we all know how damn sensitive he was (and still is) about the pathetic size of his inauguration crowds.Hopefully, these hilarious memes will force more Americans to pay attention to what Trump and the GOP is trying to do to Americans. The GOP s replacement plan puts Americans  health care in jeopardy, and will make it much more expensive for many.The GOP and Trump have not been listening to the American people. If they truly cared what the majority of Americans wanted, Obamacare would be left alone or amended at best. According to a poll by CNN/ORC, most Americans are satisfied with their health care and don t want Obamacare to be taken away. But then again, if Republicans actually cared about what the majority of Americans wanted, we d have Hillary Clinton in the White House and none of this would be happening.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 7, 2017",trump party push care act resistance country replacement millions ill income life health insurance idea draft bill replacement health care act anything trump party failure release fail corrupt leader rescue replacement apart trump explode twitter temper tantrum size inauguration attention trump replacement plan health care jeopardy trump people majority poll orc health care majority house none image twitter
5182," MSNBC Host Makes Emotional Plea To Trump Voters: Wake Up, ‘It’s A Scam’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his campaign have been scrambling to do damage control after his multiple attacks on the Khans, Gold Star parents whose Muslim son died fighting for his country. One of Trump s latest pathetic attempts to recover was to meet with Gold Star families so he could brag about it later.But MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski wasn t impressed, and was able to see right through Trump s act. In a segment about Trump s latest attempt to fool America, she had a direct message for Trump supporters: wake the f*** up. Brzezinski insisted that Trump s entire campaign was a  scam  and his meeting with these families was no different   Trump was just trying to fool gullible Americans into believing that he cares about things other than himself.Visibly upset that a person running for president would do something so heartless and take advantage of trusting Americans this way, the MSNBC host said: I m just trying to   because, look, Trump supporters, people who support Donald Trump, are people who should be respected for how they feel. Brzezinski became emotional several times while trying to beg Trump s supporters to be more critical. As her voice cracked with emotion, she continued: But I worry that they don t understand that they re being scammed, and they re being scammed by somebody who s really good at it, so it s not like, you know, it s their fault. But I will say that it s a scam, what Trump is selling. Remarking on just how heartless Trump s attacks had been on the Khans, Brzezinski urged voters not to be fooled. Talking to Gold Star families after the biggest gaffe in probably presidential politics, candidacy s history, what he did with the Khans   he s just trying to clean up. I mean, do you want someone who speaks from the heart and says nothing or says anything, or do you want someone who speaks from the heart and has some principle behind it and sticks to his word? This is a scam, and it seems like he has a lot of followers.

3368, Psychiatry Professors Make STUNNING Request To Obama Amid Concerns Over Trump,"Three professors of psychiatry have just come forward with a letter directly addressed to President Barack Obama that expresses their concerns that Donald Trump is not mentally healthy enough to be the next President of the United States.The letter was written by Judith Herman, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and two other professors of psychiatry from the University of California, San Francisco. In the letter published by the Huffington Post, the professors stated that they had  grave concern  about Trump s erratic behavior. They wrote: We are writing to express our grave concern regarding the mental stability of our President-Elect. Professional standards do not permit us to venture a diagnosis for a public figure whom we have not evaluated personally.His widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to slights or criticism, and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office. We strongly recommend that, in preparation for assuming these responsibilities, he receive a full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation by an impartial team of investigators. This letter is just a drop in the bucket, as questions about Trump s mental stability and personality have been raised since the beginning of his presidential campaign and are now becoming increasingly common as he continues to break down under the pressure. The mental states of Trump s followers have also been questioned.While the American Psychiatric Association has warned that its members should not try to diagnose Trump with mental illnesses from afar, this letter to Obama is stating a perfectly reasonable concern. Trump has acted out in ways that are unprecedented to any presidential candidate or future President of the United States. There is no question that Trump is unqualified to be President based on his lack of experience alone   but further evaluation might prove that it would be unhealthy for him to proceed in leading the country.Featured image via screenshot",News,"December 17, 2016",psychiatry letter president trump president letter professor psychiatry school psychiatry university letter grave concern trump behavior grave concern stability president venture diagnosis figure instability grandiosity impulsivity hypersensitivity criticism inability fantasy reality fitness office preparation evaluation team letter drop bucket trump stability personality beginning campaign pressure trump psychiatric association trump afar letter concern trump ways candidate president question trump president lack experience evaluation country image

Check out how George Stephanopoulos corrects Obama when Obama says  my Muslim faith THE VIDEO IS FROM 2008!THERE ARE MANY VIDEOS OF OBAMA PRAISING ISLAM WHY? YOU BE THE JUDGE: HEARD THE CALL AT THE BREAK OF DAWN We d love to know what you think about what Obama says in the videos above. I personally find this disturbing. His fundamental transformation is continuing even now. The refugee resettlement is bringing in approx. 900 Muslim refugees per month. The number is much, much higher with the Visa Program.Do Americans have an obligation to prevent this  fundamental transformation ? We think so! Look around your community and see if it s being swamped with Muslims. Thousands upon thousands of Muslims have entered just this year. Contact you local City Council or mayor and tell them you oppose the refugee resettlement in you town.I would also contact City Hall and the County Executive to intercede as well in this regard.Also, reach out to community organizations, many of which should welcome the opportunity to keep tabs on the refugee influx as well.If the agency is a Catholic-supervised operation, e.g. Migration & Refugee Services USCCB, also touch base with the Diocese as often as appropriate. Let them all know they re being monitored.It s all about pressure and oversight which these refugee resettlement operations are terrified of.Finally, if you know folks who have firsthand familiarity with the local resettlement office staff and operation, ask them to keep you posted. Not all who work for or volunteer for these agencies are lackeys.So how do you find your local resettlement agency offices?

7919, WATCH: Fake Fox News Girls Question Conservatives With Hilarious Results (VIDEO),"Watching a good old-fashioned troll perpetrated against the most uninformed American voter, the right-winger, is always a hoot. This HULU production of an episode of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog takes attractive white women to the scene of rallies for candidates, telling ridiculous lie after ridiculous lie.Time and time again the conservative knuckleheads willing to hold a sign for a candidate like Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and more. With realistic looking microphones and presumably cameramen, they capture the beauty and simplicity of the wild American  patriot.  The way they see it they re some kind of dying breed coming together as a movement. The way we see it is a dangerous bunch of people who will believe anything you tell them rallying behind lunatics and narcissistic billionaires.Dangerous is the key word.

What else can you possibly equate to Donald Trump s rise to power besides 1936? People are thrilled to be able to hate so openly. Millions of people. They want someone loud and aggressive who will  rebuild our military,  as Trump orders the best of the best of the best for our troops. If you re white, full of rage, rich, or just plain dumb, a Donald Trump presidency is a dream come true. It wouldn t take that idiot but a month to destroy our respect as a country and our economy.That makes people who support Donald Trump fair game. This bit of trickery goes quite a bit further, however, when one of the Fox girls gets a hold of Rick Santorum and asks him about Trump s plan to sterilize Puerto Ricans. Santorum is NOT in favor of sterilizing anyone at this time. The fact that he takes it seriously is comedy gold. Senator Rand Paul gets the same story and says the most intelligent thing of anyone on the entire clip:  I think that s the dumbest thing I ve ever heard. The bonus at the end is just too much.

The Community Arts Theater in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, posted on its website that the show had been dropped  due to the recent controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff. Earlier this week, CNN said Griffin would no longer co-host its live New Year s Eve special from Times Square and another show was canceled at a New Mexico casino. An endorsement deal with Squatty Potty also ended.TMZ reported that 11-yr old Barron Trump saw the decapitated, bloodied head of his father while watching TV. That didn t stop the selfish liberal Kathy Griffin from attempting to make herself out to be a victim during her press conference where she made a desperate attempt to save her career. It was revealed yesterday that she admitted in December 2016 that she desired to harm both 11-year old Barron Trump and his father, President Donald Trump:It s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately: What should comedy look like during the Trump presidency? Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,  Kathy Griffin told Vulture at the Equality Now Gala Tuesday night.  For me, that s Trump and all things Trump. It s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It s his turn. So I m happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump   and also to Barron.

21469,"SHOCKING! EVIDENCE SHOWS WHY OBAMA IS HEART OF VIOLENT #BlackLivesMatter COP KILLING, ANTI-WHITE MOVEMENT"," There will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  -Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Barack Hussein Obama s pastor for over 20 yearsWhen the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) was first formed right after George Zimmerman s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013, most overlooked the true intentions of the group beyond their calls for  justice . Fast forward to today and it can no longer be overlooked that their calls for justice now result in retaliatory violence against those whom they believe are the oppressors, namely those being white people in general and police officers specifically. By tracing the origins of the organization back to its philosophical formation in the 1960 s, we can begin to see how BLM is rooted in the radical ideological beliefs espoused by none other than President Barack Obama.Before we get to that point though, it is crucial for us to understand that BLM was founded by three militant feminists by the name of Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opel Tometi.While each played their part in contributing to the creation of the group, Garza is the driving force as she detailed the philosophy behind BLM in her October 2014 article titled A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Garza writes the following in regards to BLM s philosophy: Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement. The key takeaway from Garza s statement is found in the last two sentences primarily as she notes that BLM was created with the intention to  (re)build the Black liberation movement.  The reason this statement is of utter importance is because it ties directly to the idea of Black Liberation theology, which was the doctrine taught to Obama for over twenty years at his church in Chicago made famous by Obama s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Black Liberation theology was first formed on July 31, 1966. In an article published by NPR it is noted that: Black liberation theology originated on July 31, 1966, when 51 black pastors bought a full page ad in the New York Times and demanded a more aggressive approach to eradicating racism echo[ing] the demands of the black power movement. What is often overlooked in the formation of the group is the linkage between the Nation of Islam and Black Liberation theology as Wright s mentor and founder of Black Liberation theology James Cone credited Malcolm X with  shaking him out of his theological complacency. Stanley Kurtz of National Review highlighted this synergy in noting that according to Cone,  The black intellectual s goal is to aid in the destruction of America as he knows it.  Such destruction requires both black anger and white guilt. The black-power theologian s goal is to tell the story of American oppression so powerfully and precisely that white men will  tremble, curse, and go mad, because they will be drenched with the filth of their evil , wrote Cone.In an excerpt from Stanley Kurtz s piece drawing on the influence of Malcom X on Black Liberation theology, Kurtz states:So what exactly is  black power ? Echoing Malcolm X, Cone defines it as  complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary.  Open, violent rebellion is very much included in  whatever means ; like the radical anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon, on whom he sometimes draws, Cone sees violent rebellion as a transformative expression of the humanity of the oppressed Theologically,  Cone affirms,  Malcolm X was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil. The false Christianity of the white-devil oppressor must be replaced. Couple these words to Obama s pastor Jeremiah Wright s statement that  there will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  and you can begin to understand that the rhetoric behind Black Lives Matter that blames  white privilege  for virtually everything is rooted in Black Liberation theology. However Wright was radicalized , notes Bud White of NoQuarterUSA,  it is clear that he consciously appropriated the language and tenor of the Nation of Islam.  White documents the following:Wright s statement that 9/11 was deserved retribution ( We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans America s chickens are coming home to roost ) is a perfect echo of Malcolm X s statement that  The assassination of Kennedy is a result of that way of life and thinking. The chickens came home to roost.  Although it appears that Wright began his focus on Black Liberation Theology sometime after 1966, his racial attitudes and rhetoric have imitated that of NOI since at least 1970. Wright s blaming the United States for creating AIDS to kill minorities is but just one example of his thinking being in lockstep with NOI.The Nation of Islam and Black Liberation Theology are two doors to the same room.Black Liberation Theology is a  palatable  form of  Christian  black nationalism. The fiery anti-American, race-baiting words of Wright, Cone, and others behind the theology of Black Liberation  are from the same philosophical cauldron as the Nation of Islam , concludes White.From the beliefs that served as Obama s bedrock foundation for his ideology, is it any wonder that today that the radicals behind Black Lives Matter and the Nation of Islam are allowed a free pass to incite as much hatred and retaliation against those they deem are the oppressors? As violence has ramped up in the first half of 2015 in targeted assassinations against police officers, little to no coverage by the media is given to a meeting that was hosted by the White House on December 1st.On December 1, 2014, Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder met with seven Black and Latino organizers   from Ferguson, Mo.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; and New York City, who had been leading the ongoing actions to disrupt the status quo. In an article posted by the website FergusonAction, it is explained that during this meeting activists such as Ashley Yates were given the platform by the White House in order to reaffirm their belief that  most violence in our (their) community is coming from the police departments, and something needs to be done about it.  On December 20th  something was done about it  as two uniformed NYPD officers were assassinated in their marked car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in what Brinsley himself boasted as an act of retaliation for the death of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.Ashley Yates, BLM Organizer who created t-shirt praising cop killer, Assata ShakurThe reason Yates is emphasized here is because she, like BlackLivesMatter founder Alicia Garza, praise cop killer and former Black Liberation member Assata Shakur as a martyr for their cause.Alicia Garza, BLM founderYates even created T-shirts and hoodies that read  ASSATA TAUGHT ME  in a reference to Shakur that has become part of BLM s iconography. The fact that the president would even entertain the thought of meeting with those like Yates and other  activists  who hold cop killers as icons for their movement further goes to show how Obama s belief in Black Liberation theology, primarily that retaliation and violence should be used to further their cause, has never left him. Why else would Obama have met with these  activists  unless he was sympathetic to their plight, which given the fact that Obama spent over twenty years of his life listening to Jeremiah Wright s sermons, he very much is. Since this meeting though, what cannot be dismissed is the fact that violence in the form of targeted assassinations of both white people and police officers, have ramped up.And it will only get worse the longer we continue to allow Obama s Department of Justice to remain idly complicit.Via: Politically Short",left-news,"Sep 8, 2015",peace whites reverend pastor organization matter death martin group justice today justice retaliatory violence people organization formation none president point name part creation group force philosophy article movement philosophy matter contribution people police nationalism people men front movement queer folk background matter queer gender spectrum liberation liberation movement statement intention liberation movement reason statement importance idea liberation theology doctrine taught church pastor liberation theology article liberation theology page ad york times approach racism echo power movement formation group linkage nation liberation theology mentor founder liberation theology complacency review synergy goal destruction destruction anger guilt power goal story oppression men curse filth cone excerpt piece influence liberation theology power cone emancipation people oppression people violent rebellion anti theorist fanon cone rebellion expression humanity man devil devil oppressor pastor statement peace whites whiteness rhetoric privilege everything liberation theology language tenor nation wright statement retribution state terrorism south echo statement assassination result way life wright focus liberation theology rhetoric example nation liberation theology room liberation theology form nationalism fiery race cone theology liberation nation bedrock foundation ideology wonder today matter nation pass retaliation violence half police coverage media meeting house vice president joe attorney holder mo york city status quo article meeting platform house order belief violence community police something needs something car act retaliation death brown garner york police organizer shirt killer reason founder praise cop killer liberation member martyr cause reference part fact president thought meeting movement belief liberation theology retaliation violence cause plight fact spent life meeting cannot fact violence form people police department justice

It did not go well.Following a weekend in which Trump visited his own Virginia golf course twice and took the night off to have a large dinner at his own DC hotel, Fox News released an urgent  news alert : Pay No Attention To The Man Behind The Curtain, Nothing To See Here!News Alert: @POTUS spending weekend working at the White House. pic.twitter.com/kAtZVQE2Mr  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 26, 2017Setting aside for a moment the sheer lunacy of the bar being set so low for Donald Trump that spending three consecutive days in the official presidential residence is considered worthy of a  news alert,  the statement was a complete and total lie.

3734, Trump-Loving Santa Removed From Mall After Trash-Talking Hillary Clinton To Kids (VIDEO),"Mall Santas have one job: be jolly. Unfortunately, that was too much for one Trump-loving douchebag in a red suit to handle.WWLP reports that a mall Santa was removed from the building after he was caught bashing Hillary Clinton when he was supposed to be listening to what kids wanted for Christmas. The unnamed fake-bearded Deplorable was working at the Seminole Towne Center in Sanford, Florida when he told a little girl she was on his  nice list    which would be sweet if it wasn t a lead-in to an attack on the winner of the popular vote. Do you know who is on my naughty list?  the creepy Santa asked the little girl.  Hillary Clinton.  In fact, according to Santa, the former Secretary of State s name is the only one on the naughty list. Then he laughed like he just did something clever rather than prove to a child that Santa is a terrible person.The girl s mother called management and Santa was quickly dragged away to the North Pole (or HR mediation, whichever you prefer) so he would not be a further terrible influence on children. He was replaced with another of Santa s helpers   hopefully one who knows that it s not St. Nick s job to talk politics with children.A spokesman for the Noerr Programs, the company in charge of staffing mall Santas, said in a statement that the Santa will not be fired from his job, but that he was  given additional training. He is allowed to work with children at another location, but will not be returning to the Seminole Towne Center. It is unclear to how many other children Santa spread his poisonous message of hate, but no amount of training can keep him from being a terrible person.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via Defend Christmas",News,"November 20, 2016",mall job trump suit mall building fake deplorable center girl list lead attack winner vote list creepy fact secretary state name one list something clever child person girl mother management pole mediation influence job politics spokesman company charge mall statement job training location center message hate amount training person report incident image defend

I ll tell you the whole history of it,  Giuliani said in an interview with Fox News  Jeanine Pirro.  When he first announced it, he said  Muslim ban.  He called me up. He said,  Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.  Of course, the ban isn t implemented in Muslim countries Trump does business with. Protests have erupted across the country for two days straight over Trump s highly controversial move. Travelers, including a 77-year-old woman and a 5-year-old boy were detained.So, what do you do when you re a newly minted president and you just created worldwide chaos?

14524,AUSTRIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM Gives Teen With Homemade Nazi Tattoo Same Sentence As “Refugee” Convicted Of Anal Rape Of 72 Year Old,"Before we get too far into this story, it needs to be pointed out that the 18 year old teen who was just sentenced by a judge for having a homemade Nazi tattoo, was only 15 years old at the time, and has since admitted he made a mistake. The Afghan  rapefugee  on the other hand, was 17 years old when he brutally raped a 72 year old woman. So basically, we re comparing a 15 year old who was utilizing his freedom of expression (whether we agree with him or not is irrelevant) with a violent 17 year old rapist.An 18-year-old Afghan  refugee  was sentenced to 20 months in prison for the anal rape of a 72-year-old woman. Now the Austrian justice system has once again shown us its quality. A 20-year-old, who was 15 at the time, the  offence  was committed, has just been sentenced to 19 months in prison for giving a home-made swastika tattoo.Three young people have been found guilty of engaging in Nazi activities after they drew Nazi tattoos and posted photos of them online.A 20-year-old, who was found to have a German war flag used by the Nazis and portraits of Nazi Socialists in his room, was sentenced by a youth court in Salzburg to 19 months in prison, three months unconditional.He and a 19-year-old accomplice were found guilty of using a pin and eyeliner to tattoo a hand-sized swastika onto someone s chest and then posting the photos online.In addition to the tattooing, the 20-year-old was also accused of shouting Nazi slogans out of his window and singing the song  Polaken-Tango  by the banned neo-Nazi rock group Landser in front of his brother and his brother s girlfriend.He was arrested after his brother called the police, who found him in his room wrapped in the war flag and surrounded by photos of prominent Nazis.He told the court that he regretted his actions, which took place in August 2011 when he was 15-years-old, and that he had now changed.Pleading guilty, he said:  I now know that this is nonsense.  He was charged separately for his Facebook account, where he also posted pictures of himself making Nazi salutes, which he told judge Bettina Maxones-Kurkowski he had done to  show others that he belongs here . Via: The LocalOn Wednesday at the State Court in Vienna s Neustadt an 18-year-old Afghan was sentenced to 20 months in prison without parole for rape. He also has to pay 5000 euros compensation to the 72-year-old woman, who has been very marked by the attack.The incident on 1 September last year created a sensation: the penioner was walking her old dog in the Schwechat meadow near Traiskirchen in Lower Austria, when she encountered two young asylum seekers swimming in the river. According to an acquaintance of the victim in the witness stand, the boys were  also very nice  at first, they even helped the woman over an embankment.  But then one them fell upon her from behind. However, DNA traces confirmed that the pensioner was anally raped. The then 17-year-old Afghan was quickly caught. He does not dispute the crime, but says he was drunk. His friend says he wasn t aware of the rape.Her daughter Sylvia   a committed refugee helper   believes and hopes that her mother was unconscious during the crime. What does Christine F. feel for her tormentor? Despite all of the torment, she even feels some sympathy.

1103, Watch Malcolm Nance WIPE THE FLOOR With Breitbart Editor In Bill Maher’s Overtime,"The bright side of the Russian/Trump investigation, if you can find one, is that a lot of political stars are being born. Al Franken, while not a newbie to most, is separating himself from the chaff, as are Adam Schiff, Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats. One major rising star, though, isn t a Democrat at all   he s a former counter-intelligence officer. He considers himself a Colin Powell Republican and if he were to run for President, there s little doubt he d be a force to be reckoned with, regardless of party.After Friday night s Overtime with Bill Maher (the part of the show that s on YouTube instead of on TV), Nance confirmed his badass status when he stood up to Breitbart Editor in Chief, Alex Marlow, demanding an apology for a story that ran a few years ago that resulted in death threats to Nance and his family.On the subject of fake news, which Marlow tried to redefine as a liberal invention, Nance said this: There was this article about a 35-year counterterrorism expert who claimed they wanted Trump Tower attacked that was written in Breitbart,  Nance began.  I got 31 death threats and that came from your website you gonna apologize to me? Marlow responded that he respected Nance and his service to the country, but Nance shot back by saying,  Your followers threatened my family, my children, my wife. The Breitbart chief tried turning the tables.  Are you really suggesting that Breitbart doesn t get death threats? That our lives aren t put in danger? Marlow claimed he didn t remember the story, but if Nance would show it to him, he d apologize. Apparently, Marlow hasn t heard of the Google.Nance responded that he will  come to (his) office and see that retraction. Marlow then called Nance, who is incredibly calm,  hysterical,  which seems to be the go-to insult for anyone speaking out against the Trump administration.Here s the video:Featured image via video screenshots",News,"June 17, 2017",side trump investigation lot al chaff kamala handful star democrat counter intelligence officer colin president doubt force regardless party night overtime bill part show status editor chief apology story death family subject fake news invention article year expert trump tower death service country shot family wife chief tables death put danger story office retraction go anyone trump administration video image

6781, Viral Video Of ‘Liberal Redneck’ Hilariously DESTROYING Transgender Bathroom Laws Is MUST SEE,"There s stupid, and then there are those who write laws based off their ignorance and stupidity. It d be nice if people could just keep their stupid to themselves, but alas, we have jerks writing laws to ban transgender men and women from using the bathroom.Calling out this stupid in the most real and raw way ever is Trae Crowder, who has dubbed himself in a very viral video  The Liberal Redneck.  He absolutely decimated the ignorance surrounding the law in a magical one minute and forty-five seconds.After describing some of the lame arguments given why the law is needed to  protect kids,  Crowder says: These are the same motherf*ckers that put Mountain Dew in sippy cups and beat a six-year-old with a wire hanger for standing in front of the TV during Dr. Oz. Adding: What do you think is gonna happen? You do know that transgender people have existed forever, right? What bathrooms you think they been using? Then, after saying that the majority of sex offenders are actually grown men, Crowder throws out this zinger: Unless you re also suggesting we have separate bathrooms for Catholic priests, I think you need to cut the shit. Then brilliantly, Crowder gets to the heart of it, and that s just that those writing the laws, or those who want the laws, simply just don t like the idea of transgender individuals. He said: Because like most things that disgust you, you lack the capacity to understand it. You know, h*mos, algebra   sh*t like that. He closes by saying that whether these bigots like it or not, people like himself and those who actually have the capacity to embrace those different from ourselves, are going to ensure the world is a better, more accepting place for generations to come.Well done, Crowder, you got to the heart of it, called it out, and said it like it is.Watch the video here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 21, 2016",stupid ignorance stupidity people men bathroom stupid way crowder video ignorance law minute forty law dew year wire hanger front people majority sex men heart idea capacity algebra sh people capacity world place crowder heart video image video screen capture
2611, Twitter TRASHES Draft Dodger Donald Trump After Disgusting Attack On John McCain (TWEETS),"On Wednesday, Senator John McCain responded to White House Press Secretary s claim that the massively failed raid in Yemen that left 30 civilians and a Navy SEAL dead, didn t achieve its primary objective, and managed to recover copies of three videos that have been on YouTube for about a decade, a  huge success. According to Spicer, any criticism of the raid   which Trump authorized over dinner without adequate planning, preparation, or backup after his staffers goaded him with claims that Obama would not have the cajones to do it   is a  disservice  to the dead. The life of chief Ryan Owens was done in service to his country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information we received during that raid,  Spicer said.  Any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions he took. Full stop.  McCain disagrees: Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!  Trump tweeted. He s been losing so long he doesn t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in   bogged down in conflict all over the place. Sen.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017You know what emboldens the enemy? Failing to kill him. While he did manage to mow down women and children wholesale, Trump s raid missed al Qaeda leader Qassim al-Rimi, the primary target. Since the raid, al-Rimi has been taunting and mocking Trump in his propaganda videos. Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a  failure.'  Trump concluded triumphantly.  Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again! It is probably past time for us to  get smart  and  start winning again,  but it seems that we will need to wait four years for that. The raid killed about double the number of civilians as it did militants, the important, game-changing intelligence recovered turned out to be decade-old YouTube videos, he missed his primary target, and Yemen revoked our permission to conduct anti-terrorism operations within their borders.If this is  winning  in Trump s America, it is time for all of us to be frightened. Fortunately, The Internet is here to let Trump know what they think of his new, GREAT America where losing is winning and the Ku Klux Klan is not an extremist group.This won t be the last time Trump gets people killed with his impulsive ego-driven mistakes. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fmu26DyHHI  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 9, 2017.@realDonaldTrump ryan died because you screwed up. his blood and the blood of the american girl who died is on your hands. you did that.

4726," Trump Belittles Female Veteran, Embarrasses Himself With Totally Wrong Claim (VIDEO)","Donald Trump always believes he s right, no matter what, and even when speaking to a female veteran of the U.S. military he feels the need to be a bully. It happened again Wednesday night at the candidate forum on military issues on board the USS Intrepid.Rachel Fredericks specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps. She lost two friends to suicide, and she herself has post-traumatic stress disorder. During the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Commander-in-Chief Forum Wednesday night, Fredericks asked Trump what he was going to do to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves. Actually, it s 22,  Trump replied.  It s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country. But as the Huffington Post reports, Trump got it wrong and Ms. Fredericks was right. The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a report which revised the figures and pointed out that the tragic number of veteran suicides per day is 20.Trump couldn t let someone with far more experience than him on the issue offer her statement without butting in and attempting to override her. That behavior is part of a longstanding pattern on his behalf, a side effect of consistently surrounding himself with a series of  yes  men and women for decades now.It is also an indication of his leadership style, should he ever reach the presidency. Instead of listening to those who know better, or who have more experience, Trump only seems to pay attention to the voice in his head that always makes every issue under the sun about him.Even when the issue has been the conservative movement he now leads, Trump has done the same thing. Commenting on the recent death of anti-feminist activist Phyllis Schlafly, Trump misspelled her name in a tweet and encouraged people to buy the book she had recently written about him.In Trump s mind, he s the only one that matters.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 7, 2016",trump matter veteran military need night candidate forum board marine corps stress disorder commander chief forum night day trump country post trump department report number day trump someone experience issue statement behavior part pattern behalf side effect series men indication leadership style presidency experience trump attention voice head issue sun issue movement trump thing death activist trump name tweet people book trump mind one image capture
18776,ONE VIDEO Perfectly Illustrates Why Liberals Wanted BILL O’REILLY Off The Air,"Bill O Reilly was dismissed overnight from FOX News allegedly over allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. Was O Reilly ousted from FOX News over allegations made by women like the one who is already out promoting herself on TV shows like  The View , or because he DEMANDED both sides of the story were being heard on his show? (Watch one of the accuser s interviews on The View HERE.)Bill O Reilly took on highly controversial topics on his FOX News  The O Reilly Factor  show that other TV hosts wouldn t touch for fear of being labeled by the left as a  racist,  a  hate-monger  or  a right-wing nazi sympathizer!  O Reilly demanded both sides of the story were being told and for over 20 years he was able to rise to the top for having the courage to do just that on his wildly popular  The O Reilly Factor  show. Bill wasn t afraid to invite flame-throwers like Al Sharpton to appear on his show, in fact he relished it. O Reilly knew that if he was able to get these bad-actors on his show, that through logical discourse, he would very likely be able to expose them to his massive audience. Almost like magic, within 10-15 minutes O Reilly  was usually able to discredit them while exposing their hidden radical agenda. The video below is a perfect example of how with a respectful tone, and with composure that most of us wouldn t be able to maintain, he forces his radical leftist guests to explain their positions. By dissecting their argument and forcing them to explain themselves to his viewers, he was able to expose the hypocrisy and lies of their positions.In the interview below, O Reilly attempts to expose how the  Democratic Party is trying to undermine federal law, undermine law enforcement in general and upend our capitalistic system.  O Reilly asks a VERY IMPORTANT question of his viewers,  How many Americans even know that it is happening?  In his interview with Criminal Defense Attorney Kisha Hebdan and NYC Councilman Humane Williams, Bill O Reilly exposes the hypocrisy of the left and their support for Black Lives Matter, Abortion and illegal immigration. There aren t too many hosts who can attack all three of these very controversial subjects in one interview, but then again, that s why O Reilly had substantially more viewers than any other news host on cable TV. That s also a very good reason to eliminate him from your lineup if you re James and Lachlan Murdoch, the two liberal sons of Rupert Murdoch, who owns the FOX News network where the #1-rated host Bill O Reilly has reached a massive audience for over 20 years.Watch one video that perfectly illustrates why the left is cheering from the rooftops now that Bill O Reilly no longer has the ability to expose them: As an added bonus, watch Bill O Reilly as he exposed the lies of the left being pushed on Americans about police officers using racial hatred by low-life race-baiters like Al Sharpton:In this video, O Reilly continues to expose the lies of the left about the racial divide in America. Bill O Reilly points out  Racial politics are abhorrent and black Americans should rebel against them.

4644," Cher Reacts To Dr. Oz Reading Trump’s Health Report, And It’s The Best Thing Ever (TWEET)","This year s election is really shaping up to be one of the most ridiculous ever in the history of the republic. And adding to this bizarre circus is the fact that Dr. Mehmet Oz, noted TV host and alleged scam artist, will be the one reading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s health report.

Oz replied: It s his decision. You know, I  the metaphor for me is it s the doctor s office, the studio. So I m not going to ask him questions he doesn t want to have answered. So basically, we re only going to hear what Trump wants us to hear like a scripted reality show (which, btw, all  reality  shows are).Upon hearing the news of Dr. Oz releasing Trump s medical report, legendary entertainer extraordinaire Cher took to Twitter to let us all know how she feels about it.And because Cher tweets in fluent emoji, her tweet is translated here: Why is Dr. Oz letting Trump pimp him out!?

But in any event, polling is all over the place . Something isn t adding up,  said Caddell. Something is going to happen here, I just sense it,  he concluded.

18889,BOMBSHELL: COMEY Wanted To Expose Russian Meddling Months Before Election…OBAMA Regime Barred Him From Telling Public [VIDEO],"FBI director James Comey wanted to go public with information about Russia s interference in the 2016 election as early as last summer but was reportedly barred from doing so by the Obama administration.According to Newsweek sources, Comey presented a draft op-ed to top administration officials during a White House meeting in June or July. He had a draft of it or an outline,  the source said.  He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said,  I want to go forward, what do people think of this? Former Secretary of State John Kerry, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and ex national security adviser Susan Rice were among those in the meeting.Comey s idea was rejected because White House officials thought the message would have more impact coming from multiple agencies and not just him. An op-ed doesn t have the same stature, it comes from one person,  the source said.A second source told Newsweek the op-ed, which Comey would have likely sought to publish in the New York Times, contained the same information as the intelligence report made public on January 6 that said Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to influence the presidential election.Comey s op-ed was rejected around the same time he publicly revealed details about the investigation in Hillary Clinton s emails. The FBI director revealed before the House Intelligence Committee last week that the agency is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.He told the Intelligence Committee the Russians were  very noisy  and  unusually loud  in their hacking of US Democratic party computers.

9934,WOW! POPE FRANCES Tells Journalists That People Who Don’t Believe In Man-Made Climate Change Are “Stupid” and “Stubborn”,"Here is a portion of the interview that was conducted by a group of journalists and Pope Frances today:Vatican Insider    I leaned out to greet the children and didn t see the glass, and  pum! The Pope with a smile and an obvious dark bruise framing his left cheek, answers the question on how he feels after the small accident that happened to him in Cartagena. Immediately after the Avianca flight took off from Cartagena, Francis spoke for 38 minutes with journalists on immigration, climate change, Trump s latest measures and the situation in Venezuela. He confirmed that he had a private meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, but denied that there was talk of immigration. He expressed his support to Italy for what the country is doing by trying to manage the emergency landings and regulate immigration flows. Here is a list of US Senators who are also Catholics. Their pro-life ratings are listed in front of their names.: Senate100% Mike Johanns, R-Neb.100% Jim Risch, R-Idaho100% David Vitter, R-La.94% Pat Toomey, R-Pa.**68% Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska50% Robert Casey Jr., D-Pa.31% Mary Landrieu, D-La.23% Susan Collins, R-Maine11% Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.4% John Kerry, D-Mass.2% Richard Durbin, D-Ill.2% Tom Harkin, D-Iowa2% Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.2% Patty Murray, D-Wash.2% Jack Reed, D-R.I.1% Robert Menendez, D-N.J.0% Mark Begich, D-Alaska0% Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.0% Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.0% Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.Does anyone see a pattern here? Yet, no open condemnation for these lawmakers who actually have the power to stop the barbaric practice of abortion by the Pope. Italy is starting to feel the climate change. There have been many deaths in recent days and so much damage  Why is it that governments are delaying this realization, whereas on other issues they keep soliciting, like on the Korean arms race, for example?How ironic that the Pope would suggest climate-change deniers who ve been screaming that phony climate change data and peddlers are part of a scheme to extort money from citizens that will somehow  fix  the NOT resolved science behind  man-made climate change. I have heard of the abolition of this law, but I have not been able to read the articles on how and why this decision was taken. I do not know the situation well. However, detaching young people from their family won t bear any good fruit for young people or the family. This law comes from the executive and not from Parliament: if that is the case, I hope that they will think it over again a little bit. I have heard the President of the United States speak, who presents himself as a pro-life. If he is a good pro-life, he understands the importance of family and life: the unity of the family must be defended. When young people feel exploited, they ultimately feel hopeless. And who steals it? Drugs, other kinds of addictions, suicide  achievable when your roots are cut off. Anything that goes against the roots steals hope.

1253, WATCH: Sean Spicer Fails SPECTACULARLY When Asked About Trump’s Ridiculous Twitter Habit,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has the hardest job in Washington. He has to, on an almost daily basis, face a firing squad of reporters and try to explain his boss s crazy behavior. This is especially true when it comes to Donald Trump s infamous Twitter habit.There have been several explanations from White House officials about how reporters and the American public should treat Trump s tweets. Now that Trump has had a spectacularly nutty weekend on Twitter even by normal Trumpian standards, Spicer had to answer on Monday, point blank, if every crazy tweet is an official statement from the White House. Spicer said of the tweets: The president is the president of the United States so they are considered official statements by the president of the United States. To that end, that means that Trump s repeated attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan at a time when we should be supporting our closest ally through a crisis are official White House statements. That means that the infamous  covfefe  tweet is an official White House statement. That means that every lie, every personal attack, every crazy or vulgar or downright bizarre thing Trump has tweeted since taking office on January 20th is an official White House statement. Think about that, and weep for this nation, folks.After that clearly not well thought out response, Spicer went on to say that Trump is in no way worried that he will hurt his Muslim ban case with the Supreme Court with his tweets in that direction, either. Spicer didn t really address the tweets themselves, only sticking to the White House party line and saying: The court should follow the law. There s no question that we should prevail. Of course, if Trump continues to undermine his own case, they won t prevail, and that is sure to result in more attacks on the judiciary via   you guessed it   Twitter.What a crazy time to be living in. But what did we expect?

11070,THESE LIVES MATTERED: Americans Furious As New Orleans Joins Left’s Effort To Erase History,"It s a sad day in New Orleans Cultural Marxism has won The mayor of New Orleans wanted treasured cultural monuments removed and he got what he wished for at the expense of the citizens of the city: We will no longer allow the Confederacy to literally be put on a pedestal in the heart of our city.    New Orleans Mayor Mitch LandrieuThe City of New Orleans removed the first of four Confederate monuments this morning in an effort to appease those who believe the monuments represent racism or pretty much anything else they object to. By erasing our past, do we change anything?Some on Twitter are saying: New Orleans starts taking down Confederate statues, like ISIS did in the Middle East removing the history of our lives. It s not that we can compare religious persecution to a cleansing of history but it does have some similarities.Emotions are running high because this involves a time in our history that brother fought brother and died Should we forget the struggle and refuse to honor those who fought and died? Isn t it true that we should always remember history and learn from it?We should also honor the soldiers who fought and died No matter what!A LETTER FROM A PATRIOT WHO MAKES THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE MONUMENTS:By William McMichaelAny Longhorn will proudly declare that The University of Texas is more than an academic institution. The University is a beacon   a promise that Texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. However, the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from the Main Mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.I believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the Confederacy to museums. Its legacy haunts the United States in ways that many will never understand. Recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the Civil War inflicted. However, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of Confederacy continue to stand on the South Mall.In fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the University worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. Much like the university, the Main Mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. The university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the North and South. Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, sons of Union and Confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of France during World War I. Their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.The South Mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the Confederacy, a sign that the era of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Albert Sidney Johnston would no longer govern Texas. However, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of Texas  hope for a progressive future: President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Jim Hogg, and Senator John Reagan   a former Confederate sympathizer who encouraged Texas to rejoin the Union.The statues look center toward a statute of George Washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. The Littlefield Fountain bears a Latin inscription that translates to read:  Short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. Ultimately, the South Mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that Texas can triumph in spite of its past. Yet rather than explain the Main Mall s history and purpose to the public, the University allowed errant voices to rule the day. As a result, future generations will likely forget the Main Mall s importance altogether. The moral of the story will be no more.Longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances. Fight for worthwhile causes, and remember your history. It will make you better, and thereby prompt you to change the world.McMichael lives in Waco.

22253,POLITICAL AGITATOR: Globalist George Soros Linked to Over 50 ‘Partners’ of the Women’s March on Washington,"21st Century Wire says More than 50 NGO  partners  of the Women s March on Washington were found to be tied to social movement financier George Soros. While the DC gathering was billed as a grassroots movement for women s rights in America, it was anything but as a string of multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was clearly an anti-Donald Trump event following the US presidential inauguration this past week.  DIVIDE BY DESIGN    (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As we ve stated before here at 21WIRE, this kind of political protest is designed to first cause public disruption, while also fomenting a form of socially-engineered cultural, gender and class warfare.In the case of the Women s March on Washington, a militant style of identity politics was on a full frontal display. Enter stage left   the celebrities This was never more apparent than the hate filled diatribe of Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, whose angry rhetoric was eclipsed only by famed singer Madonna, who during her obscenity laced speech admitted to harboring violent thoughts directed at the White House. Consequently, the Material Girl is now reportedly under Secret Service investigation for her bomb related threat this past Saturday.Watch how both Judd and Madonna are driven by rage during their politically divisive speeches at the Women s March on Washington https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5ZkrQHyNcDuring an interview with ABC NEWS, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway  didn t see the point,  of the Women s March. Additionally, Conway underscored that 29-30 million women across America voted for Trump and their voices were heard in the 2016 election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEiGcT9wD4QUESTION: Was the heavily organized Women s March on Washington just another example of a radical globalist and cultural Marxist  progressive  agenda at play?Historically speaking, many social movements have worked to erode the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals (color revolutions), and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will recognize these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this latest protest movement in America.While it still remains to be seen if Trump s stated political vision for America can unite an embattled nation, one thing is clear   many NGO groups operating inside the US will continue their organized opposition to the newly elected president over the course of his time in the White House.  BITTER PILL    Madonna s waning singing career gives way to cultural upheaval and demagoguery. (Image Source: Extra.ie)Other  partners  for the march included the American Atheists and UniteWomen.org, who ran a public relations campaign which featured videos with the hashtags #ImWithHer, #DemsInPhily and #ThanksObama. Once again, all road lead back to billionaire Hillary Clinton financier, George Soros and his Open Society NGO empire.Writer Asra Nomani expands on the Soros web here: By my draft research, which I m opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march s  partners,  including  key partners  Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with  Women s March  organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as  a leader of tomorrow  as a march co-chair and another official as  the head of logistics ). Other Soros grantees who are  partners  in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven t yet returned queries for comment. NOTE: See her full story below.The Free Thought Project illustrates the contrived socially engineered nature behind the Women s March on Washington in lengthy passage below:Washington, D.C.   An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a  would-be dictator  during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide  Women s Marches  that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.The march s official website says,  We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.  Many people turned out to be a manifestation of that ideal, but it s important to understand the reality of what is happening on a strategic political level as an inorganic politically contrived and funded event. This, in no way, takes away from the validity of standing up for women s issues but is important to note that women are being used as pawns in a larger ideological political game that has international overtones of power politics.These marches were largely billed as  spontaneous  and  grassroots  actions, by publications like The Guardian and Vox. However, the reality exposed by an investigation by self-described liberal feminist Asra Q. Nomani, writing for New York Times affiliate Women in the World, revealed that after studying the  funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march, contrary to the non-partisan rhetoric used in these marches, they were not really  women s march  but were rather  for women who are anti-Trump. Nomani reveals that the  Women s Marches  were actually organized as political tools to be used to strategically forward a progressive political agenda against President Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down driven political operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. More from the NY Times affiliate Women in the World below   SOROS MARCH?    The Women s March in Washington DC revealed some deep NGO pockets lurking behind the scenes. (Image Source: thefederalist.com). Asra Q. Nomani NY Times   Women in the WorldIn the pre-dawn darkness of today s presidential inauguration day, I faced a choice, as a lifelong liberal feminist who voted for Donald Trump for president: lace up my pink Nike sneakers to step forward and take the DC Metro into the nation s capital for the inauguration of America s new president, or wait and go tomorrow to the after-party, dubbed the  Women s March on Washington ? The Guardian has touted the  Women s March on Washington  as a  spontaneous  action for women s rights. Another liberal media outlet, Vox, talks about the  huge, spontaneous groundswell  behind the march. On its website, organizers of the march are promoting their work as a grassroots effort with  independent  organizers. Even my local yoga studio, Beloved Yoga, is renting a bus and offering seats for $35. The march s manifesto says magnificently,  The Rise of the Woman = The Rise of the Nation. It s an idea that I, a liberal feminist, would embrace. But I know   and most of America knows   that the organizers of the march haven t put into their manifesto: the march really isn t a  women s march.  It s a march for women who are anti-Trump. As someone who voted for Trump, I don t feel welcome, nor do many other women who reject the liberal identity-politics that is the core underpinnings of the march, so far, making white women feel unwelcome, nixing women who oppose abortion and hijacking the agenda. To understand the march better, I stayed up through the nights this week, studying the funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march.

8462, WATCH Stephen Colbert Moderate A Hilarious Trump Vs. Trump Debate,"Stephen Colbert had his own solution to Trump skipping the debate on Thursday: Since  25 million  viewers were denied the opportunity to see Trump debate, Colbert decided to moderate his own hilarious debate where Trump debates Trump and where Colbert would would pick up those 25 million viewers for his own ratings.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpKiP_gmDS8]The Late Show host said that the GOP front-runner was  the star of this year s top reality show,  and renamed it  celebrity the president,  so it was only fitting that he have his chance to shine on the stage.Colbert used footage of  two Trumps  being asked the same question, but with contradictory responses on different occasions. For example, on Jan. 17, Trump had said that  no one likes  Ted Cruz  once they get to know him,  yet on  Dec. 11, Trump said that he liked the Texas senator  a lot. Trump had also said as recently as this month that he loved the people of Iowa but during a speech in November, he wondered  how stupid are the people of Iowa? In July, Trump said that Hillary Clinton was the   worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States.  However,  in March 2012, he said Hillary was a  terrific woman,  saying,  I think she does a good job and I like her. And of course, there was Megyn Kelly. This week, Trump said he had  zero respect  for Kelly, adding that she s  highly overrated  and doesn t do a good job. However, a previous clip shows that in 2011 Trump told Kelly during an interview that she has  done a great job, by the way, and I mean it,  he said, with a creepy smile.In his segment, Colbert is able to show the contradictions and hypocrisy that Trump exemplifies in a way that is hilarious but shocking in terms of how Trump, despite being Trump, continues to lead in the polls.Featured image via YouTube screenshot.",News,"January 29, 2016",solution debate opportunity debate debate trump trump watch show host front runner star year reality show president chance stage footage question example trump one trump senator lot trump month people speech people trump secretary state history march woman job course week trump respect job clip trump interview job way creepy smile segment hypocrisy trump way trump image

1478, Lindsey Graham: Trump Should Be Treated With The Same Respect Republicans Gave Obama,"We re wondering if Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) is OK. He just doesn t seem to be himself lately. The South Carolina Republican was so fiercely critical of alleged president Donald Trump, but that s all suddenly changed now. Graham, who once called Trump a  jackass,  praised the amateur president on Saturday as a leader who is open-minded  and is even willing to reach out for help, even late at night, according to the Washington Examiner. What have I learned about our president? He s curious, he asks questions, and he knows no fear,  Graham said in his remarks at the South Carolina Republican convention.  And he s under siege unlike any president I ve ever seen in my entire life   They don t believe he won; I do. Now Obama was somewhat hard for us, but I thought we were somewhat respectful,  Graham added without one bit of irony whatsoever.Graham then went to on to disrespect former President Barack Obama by calling him a  community organizer who apologized for America every turn all over the world. Let me tell you that you have a commander in chief that s not going to let this country get walked over anymore,  he said.And that s really cute, don t you think? He said that of Obama who had 20 years of experience under his belt before taking the job as President while praising a former reality show star who had zero experience in politics. He calls and I m honored that he would call me and I want to help him,  he said.  He calls me when I m asleep and he calls me after I go to bed. I wish he would rest more. I gave him my phone number. So far so good. It s nice he has a cozy relationship with a man who just recently penned him a letter to assure him that he has no connections to Russia. Lindsey Graham requested that information. Trump s lawyers said in the letter that a review of the last 10 years of Trump s tax returns revealed that he has no income from Russia  with a few exceptions. Here s the kicker: The law firm who sent the letter actually has deep ties to   wait for it   Russia. Lindsey Graham appeared to be that one Republican with a spine willing to call out the White House, but now he s rolling over while claiming that Republicans respected Obama. Democrats are just being big ol  meanies to the man who is plagued in scandals while only 120ish days into the job.Trump, for the record, is the same man who dogged Obama for years, insisting that our first black President was actually a scary Muslim from Kenya. Obama did not have conflicts of interest. The biggest scandal at this same amount of time during Obama s presidency was that he put Dijon mustard on his hamburger. That was the big scandal featured on Fox News for a week. In contrast, Trump has a massive amount of conflicts of interest.Sure, Lindsey, we ll give Trump the same respect Republicans gave Obama.

9067,LOOK WHO Approved Visas For Russian Operatives To Enter US And Interfere In Election,"According to Fox News  A federal grand jury on Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that detailed a sophisticated plot to wage  information warfare  against the U.S.The Russian nationals are accused of setting a  strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election. The indictment   the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller s probe   effectively returns focus to the meddling activities out of Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, following a string of charges relating to the actions of Trump associates.Further, the DOJ made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, said at a Friday press conference.President Trump reacted to the indictments by seizing on Rosenstein s comment that the election results were not impacted by the Russians  activity. Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,  Trump tweeted.  The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong   no collusion! Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President.

19468,"KELLYANNE CONWAY Responds To DEATH THREATS Against Her After Hillary’s Communications Director Pens Hate-Filled, Inflammatory Washington Post Op-Ed [VIDEO]","Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Hillary Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri got in a very heated argument at a forum hosted by Harvard University s Kennedy School of Government on December 1st where they talked about the aftermath of the election. There were many fiery exchanges.The conversation quickly devolved into Palmieri accusing the Trump campaign of running on a platform of white supremacy and catering to the  alt-right.  Conway called the Clinton campaign bitter and that their candidate just couldn t connect with people is the reason why they lost.Here is the exchange:.@KellyannePolls talks to @HardballChris about receiving death threats and the need to end incendiary rhetoric https://t.co/wF6jv1b8nl  Hardball (@hardball) December 9, 2016Here is the Op-ed written by sore loser and closet Catholic-basher Jen Palmieri who clearly can t get over the fact that a woman helped Trump win the presidency. It s also the op-ed that according to Conway caused her to receive death threats:Jennifer Palmieri was communications director for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.I know how to be a gracious loser.I could have let it go last week when Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump s campaign manager, challenged me to look her in the eye and say she ran a campaign that gave white supremacists a platform. I considered for a split second. I knew you were supposed to be gracious when you come for the post-election forum at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government. But I decided this was a year where normal rules don t apply. Speaking the truth was more important. It did. Kellyanne, it did,  I told her. It s just a fact. Trump winning the election doesn t change that. To my mind, his win makes it all the more important that the truth be acknowledged.My colleagues and I from the Hillary Clinton campaign knew what we were likely to face from the Trump side at the Harvard University event and thought hard about our obligations as representatives of the losing side in this most unconventional of years   particularly when our candidate actually won the popular vote by a large margin. As I like to note, Clinton received more votes for president than any white man in U.S. history.Our candidate gave us a good model to follow. She had the grace to call Trump on election night to congratulate him and concede. But in her concession speech she also challenged all of us to defend our rights and principles under the Constitution   rights and principles that she and many of the people who voted for her feared could be under threat in a Trump presidency. The campaign has ended, and we accept that Trump won. But we are not laying down our principles or abandoning our supporters. That s the frame of mind I brought to Harvard.A good bit of the post-election analysis has centered on what our campaign should have done differently. That s appropriate. We should think long and hard about why we lost. Trust me, we have.But it s also important for the winners of this campaign to think long and hard about the voters who rejected them. I haven t seen much evidence of such introspection from the Trump side. That s concerning.I don t know whether the Trump campaign needed to give a platform to white supremacists to win. But the campaign clearly did, and it had the effect of empowering the white-nationalist movement.Trump provided a platform by retweeting white nationalists   giving their views an audience of millions. Views previously relegated to the darkest corners of the Internet also had a platform on Breitbart, the website of Trump campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon.  Before Trump, our identity ideas, national ideas, they had no place to go,  said Richard Spencer, president of a white-nationalist think tank that held a post-election conference in Washington. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said this fall,  The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning. So one person who is tied to a white nationalist think tank says he supports Trump on Twitter and that somehow confirms that Trump s campaign was built around a white nationalist movement?If you want to waste more time reading this sore loser s false and unfounded accusations, the entire op-ed can be found here: Washington Post",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016",trump campaign manager campaign director argument forum university school government aftermath election conversation trump campaign platform supremacy alt campaign bitter candidate people reason exchange death need rhetoric loser catholic fact woman presidency death director campaign loser week trump campaign manager eye campaign platform post election forum school government year truth fact election change mind win truth campaign side university event side candidate vote margin president man history candidate model grace trump election night concession speech constitution people threat trump presidency campaign trump frame mind bit post election analysis campaign campaign evidence introspection side trump campaign platform campaign effect movement trump platform audience millions platform trump campaign executive identity place spencer president nationalist think tank post election conference leader duke fall fact person nationalist think tank trump twitter trump campaign movement time sore loser post

6539, WATCH: These Videos Will Make Trump The Most Toxic Candidate EVER,"As John Kasich became the last rival to pull out of his campaign, ceding the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton welcomed her opponent to the adult table and released a pair of web videos designed to define the candidate and make it so no sane voter could pull the lever for him this fall.With the release of the new material, Clinton began to answer one of the biggest questions of 2016: How hard and how strong will Democrats go after Trump, and what will the difference be between those ads and ads released by the so-called #NeverTrump groups on the right?Unlike many of the conservative ads, who claimed Trump was a fake member of their movement, the Clinton videos just attack Trump for his unpopular conservative ideas while also pointing out his historic unpopularity.In addition to a biting video highlighting conservatives attacking Trump, the web videos showed that Clinton is going nuclear, making Trump s right wing positions toxic in the general election.The first video takes Trump at his word, and shows a montage of the reality TV star making promises on the campaign trail. These include unpopular ideas like getting rid of gun free zones at schools, defunding Planned Parenthood, building his silly wall at the U.S.   Mexico border, banning Muslim travel, and pushing waterboarding.""Everything I say, I'm going to do, folks.""

20324,"OHIO COLLEGE PROFESSOR Makes Threatening Post To Facebook: “Bunch of us anti-gun types are going to have to arm ourselves, storm the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, VA…make sure there are no survivors”","James Pearce, an anti-gun adjunct professor at Southern State Community College in Ohio, made an outrageous, threatening Facebook post on June 13, 2016, that is reportedly under investigation by the proper authorities. By the way, the post still remains on his Facebook page. Apparently, making a threat about shooting people up on Facebook is not offensive to the paid censors as long as it s directed at the pro-gun crowd. A look at his Facebook page will prove that he is unapologetic after making the disgusting remarks and in fact, is calling it a joke. Funny we re not seeing the humor in these sick remarks: A bunch of us anti-gun types are going to have to arm ourselves, storm the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, VA, and make sure there are no survivors. Here is the actual post:The Highland County Press reported that Pearce s comments were sent to authorities and SSCC on June 15.Kris Cross, Director of Public Relations for SSCC, told Campus Reform that  it is the college s policy not to comment on individual personnel matters,  but did offer some general observations of potential relevance to the case. In general, the college would alert local authorities about any threats that were made known to the college, especially any threats made to students, faculty or staff,  she explained.  We have a good working relationship with the police jurisdictions covering each of our four campuses, and trust they would follow their protocols for reporting to other agencies.

15586,CLUELESS IN LIBYA: CLINTON E-MAILS SHOW MORE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK," We came,we saw, he died    HRCIn short, without Mrs. Clinton s vigorous intervention, Qadhafi would still be in power, Libya would still be a country, and the jihadis who now own the place would be toast. And, of course, Chris Stevens, Smith, Doherty and Woods would still be alive.The emails show more than you might think:On August 21, 2011, a top aide to Hillary Clinton penned a memo lauding his boss for steering U.S. policy in Libya, aimed at convincing the media of her accomplishments as Secretary of State. HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime,  Clinton aide Jake Sullivan wrote.Sullivan s memo to Mrs. Clinton s inner circle is, of course, embarrassing today, which is one reason you are not reading about it on the front pages of The New York Times or The Washington Post.But that s not the only reason.The memo, as well as other critical State Department correspondence, was withheld from multiple committees in Congress that have been investigating the September 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department communications officer Sean Smith, and two former Navy Seals then working on contract to the CIA, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.It finally surfaced on May 22, 2015, in response to a subpoena from the Select Committee on Benghazi chaired by South Carolina Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy. That was six months after Gowdy s initial request to the State Department for all documents relating to Benghazi, and more than two-and-a-half years after a similar request from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which initiated its investigation into Benghazi just days after the attacks.In Sullivan s memo, Mrs. Clinton was the driving force in getting the Russians to drop opposition to a UN-imposed no fly zone on Qadhafi s Libya. She alone got Turkey, Qatar and Jordan to join the coalition military operations and to provide critical support to the anti-Qadhafi forces.To convince skeptical allies to embrace her policies, Sullivan noted that Mrs. Clinton had traveled to Paris, London, Berlin, Rome, Abu Dhabi, Addis Ababa and Istanbul. She visited with  House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation. Sullivan s memo provided background for media appearances by Secretary Clinton in the ensuing months, including a famous encounter with a TV news reporter in Afghanistan, just three days after Mrs. Clinton s October 2011 visit to Libya to proclaim victory against the then-still-missing Libyan dictator.In video outtakes, Clinton aide Huma Abedin hands the Secretary a Blackberry, with information that Colonel Qadhafi has been killed, apparently just hours after Mrs. Clinton s brief visit to the country. We came, we saw, he died,  Mrs. Clinton joked.In short, without Mrs. Clinton s vigorous intervention, Qadhafi would still be in power, Libya would still be a country, and the jihadis who now own the place would be toast. And, of course, Chris Stevens, Smith, Doherty and Woods would still be alive.After the attacks, Mrs. Clinton quickly forgot her leading role on Libya, sending a clueless Susan Rice to the Sunday talk shows to be the  public face  of the Obama administration s Libya policy.In her only public appearances to address what happened in Benghazi, she portrayed herself as a disengaged onlooker, called upon to pick up the pieces when the hired help failed to get things right.  [It] was very disappointing to me that the [Accountability Review Board (ARB)] concluded there were inadequacies and problems in the responsiveness of our team here in Washington to the security requests that were made by our team in Libya. And I was not aware of that going on. It was not brought to my attention,  she told the House Foreign Affairs committee in January 2013.She reminded House and Senate panels in January 2013 that the State Department s ARB, which she appointed, had determined that the failures in Benghazi were entirely the responsibility of lower level officials, even though Libya was among the top ten most dangerous postings in the world at the time of the attacks. The Washington Post s Glenn Kessler busily helped to reinforce that fiction in a  fact-checking  blog aimed to show that there were simply too many cables going in and out of the State Department for a busy Secretary to see all of them.Interestingly, in the approximately 300 Clinton emails the State Department has released so far, there is no record of Mrs. Clinton s original request to her staff to draft a memo lauding her achievements in Libya. Did Sullivan simply dream up the idea and forward it up the chain of command to see if it would please his boss? Or was Mrs. Clinton s request for these talking points one of the 30,000  personal  emails the former Secretary of State deleted as irrelevant to her official duties?Mrs. Clinton s chief of staff Cheryl Mills forwarded Sullivan s August 2011 memo to a second private Hillary email address. Remember how she insisted that she had just one private email account? The memo included a note that said,  Here s the memo.  That sounds an awful lot like,  Here s the memo you requested. Hillary sent it on to her personal assistant with the instruction,  Pls print for me. This type of exchange gets repeated many times in the Clinton emails released so far, suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was not given to making substantive comments via email, or that she deleted material that is relevant to the House Select Committee on Benghazi and is therefore guilty of obstructing justice. The other possibility is that the State Department Freedom of Information office is inexplicably dragging its feet in clearing Mrs. Clinton s correspondence, even though the delay casts Mrs. Clinton in an embarrassing light.Judicial Watch and other watchdog organizations including this author had been trying to get Mrs. Clinton s emails and other U.S. government documents relevant to the Benghazi attacks for the past two-and-a-half years without success until the subpoena from the Select Committee on Benghazi compelled a response.Now, thanks to a federal court order in Washington, DC, compelling the State Department to produce additional documents it previously had said did not exist or were properly categorized as classified, we can now put Mrs. Clinton s emails into a broader context.As the first reports of the attacks on Benghazi were whizzing through the State Department Operations Center, bouncing off the computers of lower level employees, one is impressed by their professionalism.For example, the British security firm that had the contract to guard the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi sent several ungrammatical missives through a State Department contact to update him on what was happening during the attacks.Dylan Davies, one of the contractors working for the security firm, was apparently holed up in his hotel room (not at the scene of the Compound leading a daring rescue attempt, as he told CBS  60 Minutes), with no information at 11:55 p.m. local time by which time, Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith were dead, the CIA contractors led by Ty Woods had driven the attackers away from the burning diplomatic compound, and evacuated back to the CIA Annex.A half hour later, Davies sent a second report, claiming there had been  no casualties,  and relaying a hearsay report from his  Benghazi facilitator,  who claimed that sources on the street were telling him the attack was either a September 11th anniversary attack, or caused by an Internet movie  disrespecting Mohammed. In relaying those reports, the State Department s Command Center cautioned that they should be  taken with a grain of salt as the Employee may not be aware of the extent of the situation. And yet, less than four hours later with no other independent reporting that had been released Hillary Clinton issued her statement blaming the attacks on an Internet video.What happened in the meantime? Who pushed the idea of the Internet video?The short answer is that:we still don t know. Either Mrs. Clinton destroyed the emails and other documents showing how she latched onto a report her own specialists had rejected as hearsay, or perhaps the Archangel Gabriel whispered in her ear while she had her head in a closet in her 7th floor office suite.Several emails released to Judicial Watch show the intense involvement of the Bureau of Public Affairs in scouring the Internet for information on the attacks, but nothing to suggest the Secretary of State was asking the intelligence community what they knew.At 9:30 p.m, just 40 minutes before Mrs. Clinton issued her official statement blaming the attacks on a YouTube video Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Dana Shell Smith sent out a request to her reporting officers to find information  in the aftermath of today s demonstrations at Embassy Cairo.  For whatever reason, her request failed to mention Benghazi.Rebecca Brown Thompson, head of a State Department media office called the  Rapid Response Unit  (reminiscent of the Clinton campaign  war room ), responded by sending snippets from Facebook postings gleaned by Arabic language media analysts. I see a variety of responses spanning from conspiracy theories (that is what the Americans and Israelis are doing on purpose to hurt Arabs and Muslims, they financed the offensive movie), to those who condemn the attacks as  UnIslamic and barbaric,  one analyst reported.Two hours after Mrs. Clinton issued the statement blaming the attacks on the  inflammatory material posted on the Internet,  a second Arabic media analyst tasked with justifying that statement found a lone tweet about the film, but also reported that  some Twitter users in Libya and Egypt are spreading reports that the attacks in Libya may not be related to the infamous film but to the killing of Al Qaeda s second in command, who is Libyan. The  infamous  film, which was much less well known in Libya than in Egypt, became the subject of a scurrilous account appearing the very next morning that was penned by Max Blumenthal, son of the infamous Sid  Vicious  Blumenthal who was advising Mrs. Clinton. It was picked up and amplified in a second attack blog posted at 6:56 a.m. the same morning, suggesting that the real blame for the attacks in Cairo and Benghazi fell on Mitt Romney and his  extremist  backers who produced this YouTube video in the first place.Once information from the professionals rose to the level of Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills in Clinton s office, it just seemed to disappear, replaced with a weird concoction of politics, public relations and outright fantasy, such as the YouTube video concoction or the Sid Blumenthal  intelligence  reports. (When Mrs. Clinton sent those around to the professional diplomats, the comments she received in response were rarely complimentary.)The 300 recently released Clinton emails give the impression that the 7th floor of the State Department was inhabited by a bunch of grad students, pretending to be government officials.The most tragic example of the apparent ignorance of how the State Department and the federal government actually worked appeared in Mrs. Clinton s order to not engage the Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST), an interagency team on 24/7 stand-by alert, that had been created to respond to just such an emergency as the Benghazi attacks.Counterterrorism Bureau official Mark Thompson, who helped to establish the FEST after the 1998 Africa embassy attacks, testified at length before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about this on May 8, 2013.The Judicial Watch emails include a frustrated note he sent to the State Department Operations Center at 9:01 p.m. on the night of the attacks, complaining that Secretary Clinton was trying to get the FBI to send an evidence response team to Libya, when  the State (CT) led Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) would include those folks, along with experts from other agencies. We should avoid multiple requests for assistance and rely on the comprehensive FEST approach. In his Congressional testimony, Thompson said he had tried to get Mrs. Clinton s office and the White House to approve activating the FEST as soon as he first learned about the attacks from the State Operations Center, but was told  it was not the right time and it was not the team that needed to go right then. The redacted portions of Thompson s email undoubtedly included a reference to the heavily-armed special operations component of the FEST whose job would be to secure the facility under attack. Had Secretary Clinton not told the FEST to stand down early on, there s a chance they might have arrived in Benghazi before Woods and Doherty were killed in the 5 a.m. mortar attack the next morning.At the very least, they would have been able to secure the compounds and gather evidence on the spot, instead of waiting three weeks as the FBI was ultimately forced to do.Mrs. Clinton s aversion to any overt U.S. military presence in Libya was well-known at U.S. Africa Command, which had been supplying the ambassador s security detail up until just weeks before the attacks.  We were not allowed to wear uniforms outside the embassy compound, not even our boots,  the head of Stevens  U.S. Special Forces security detail told me.  People high up at State resented like Hell us being there and doing what we did. And in the end, those same people ordered the Ambassador s Special Forces security detail to leave Libya with disastrous consequences.Via: Accuracy in Media",politics,"Jun 11, 2015",intervention power country place course show august aide memo boss policy media secretary state voice administration contact group face effort authorization coalition regime jake memo circle course today reason york times post reason memo state department correspondence congress ambassador state department officer smith navy contract glen tyrone response subpoena committee congressman trey request state department half request house oversight government reform committee investigation days memo force opposition un fly zone jordan coalition support anti allies berlin abu house fund operation memo background media secretary encounter news reporter days visit victory dictator video secretary blackberry information colonel visit country intervention power country place course role rice talk face administration policy onlooker help accountability board responsiveness team security team attention house committee house senate state department responsibility level ten world time post fiction fact state department secretary state department record request staff memo idea forward chain command boss request secretary state irrelevant chief staff august memo address memo note memo lot memo assistant instruction print type exchange times material house committee justice possibility state department freedom information office correspondence delay embarrassing watch watchdog author government success subpoena committee response court order state department context state department level professionalism example security firm contract compound state department contact security firm hotel room scene compound daring rescue attempt information time time ambassador smith compound hour report report facilitator street attack attack movie state department command center grain salt employee extent situation statement video idea video answer report hearsay archangel ear head closet floor office watch involvement bureau information nothing secretary state intelligence community statement video deputy assistant secretary shell request information aftermath today reason request head state department media office response unit reminiscent campaign war room language media variety conspiracy purpose movie analyst statement material media analyst justifying statement tweet film twitter film killing second command film subject account morning son attack morning suggesting blame mitt extremist video place information level jake office concoction politics fantasy video concoction intelligence response impression floor state department bunch government example ignorance state department government order emergency support team interagency team stand alert emergency bureau official mark embassy length house oversight government reform committee watch note state department night secretary evidence response team state emergency support team assistance approach testimony office house state center time team reference component job facility attack secretary chance mortar morning evidence spot aversion presence command ambassador security detail embassy compound boots head security detail people state hell end people ambassador security detail accuracy media
5386, The RNC Has Made Itself The De Facto Judge And Jury Of America,"We all knew the 2016 Republican National Convention would be a Hillary hate fest. For the past three days, Republicans have given the voters not one reason to vote for them, but many reasons why they shouldn t vote for Hillary Clinton.No substance, only an us-against-them mentality. This shouldn t come as a shock to anyone.But what has come as a shock is that the RNC has crowned itself as the de facto judge and jury of America. Not only was it a Hillary hate fest, it was a hyper-partisan witch hunt that transcends anything we ve seen in presidential politics.While their presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, paints himself (humorously) as the  law and order  candidate, speaker after speaker, from General Michael Flynn, to Patricia Smith, to Chris Christie, have decided to take the law into their own hand, and convict Hillary Clinton of egregious crimes. They are, in their minds, the judge and jury that will convict Hillary Clinton, courts be damned.No matter how many times they scream  guilty,   lock her up,  or  Hillary for prison,  they know, as much as anyone else, that Clinton is innocent. Since the 1990s, when Ken Starr and his band of ideological thugs (including Newt Gingrich), Republicans have never been able to successfully pin anything on Hillary Clinton. Not Rose Law Firm, not Whitewater, not Benghazi, and not her emails. Yet they have convinced themselves that they know better than the law, and they know better than the judges, juries, prosecutors and special counsels that have spent countless hours   no, years   trying to find something, anything, to convict Hillary Clinton of.Republicans know what they re doing. It s pure political theater. It s tidbit SoundBits that stick in voters  minds and fester until election day, polluting the electorate s ability to look at the facts in an objective, impartial manner. They know they can t really convict her, but if they can convince the people that they re right and the law is wrong, that s good enough for them.But in the eyes of the Republicans, whose only goal is to win and not govern, the court of public opinion is mightier than the courts that uphold the rule of law.There is no law and order with Republicans. That s just a talking point they use when they want to stop black people from having their voices heard or when they don t like the Supreme Court granting marriage rights to same-sex couples.These instances, coupled with their sophomoric chants at their coveted convention, shows one thing: Republicans do not respect the law. They do not respect the institutions thatAl Franken is right.  Lock her up  has become a banana republic for the GOP. They have no substance to run on. Hillary Clinton is their main topic, and their world s revolve around her. It s actually quite pathetic not just on the surface but also deep down. They know they can t win with their ideas, so they must rely on smearing others.The Democratic convention can t come fast enough.Featured image via Jeff J.

22753,TSA: US Residents from 9 States Will Need Passports for Domestic Flights,"This latest move by America s notorious Transportation Security Authority (TSA) seems to be step one in a move towards a national ID Card, complete with biometrics and embedded RFID technology.By forcing residents of nine states to get passports in order to board domestic flights, the TSA is de facto pushing those states towards the implementation of a new state-of-the-art ID card system.This will help to give real teeth to the  The Real ID Act It s just the next phase in the further militarization of US society.Forbes reports You may have thought you don t need a passport because you don t travel outside the United States. But for residents of nine states, that will change at the beginning of 2018 for any commercial flight, whether international or domestic.Nine states will no longer allow travelers to board an airplane with just their state issued driver s licenses as of January 22, 2018. To get past TSA security checkpoints, another form of identification will be required: passport, permanent resident card/green card or a military ID.The Real ID Act of 2005 states that state-issued IDs from these nine states do not meet the minimum security standards of the federal government:With just a few months until the Real ID Act goes into full effect, it is time to start planning now and look into getting your passport. Here is the airport signage, placed around the security checkpoints in airports to remind U.S. travelers of what;s to come (with my emphasis): Starting January 22, 2018, you will need a driver s license or ID from a state compliant with the REAL ID ACT, a state that has an extension for compliance, or an alternate ID to fly. For REAL ID information, and a list of acceptable IDs, visit tsa.gov.  Some states have started working on offering federally approved issued IDs that would not require a passport for domestic air travel. Check with your local government office to see if there is a different type of ID you can apply for, and the TSA website to clarify this situation. Because on January 22, 2018, the enforcement for those nine states will go into effect, and by 2020, even more people will end up needing a passport, as confirmed by the official website of the Transportation Security Administration.To repeat, if you re going to take a flight and you have a state-issued ID from one of those nine states listed above, unless your state has made federally approved changes before January, you should use a passport to go anywhere across the country, as all domestic travel is included in these new standards. (States other than those nine will not be affected.)Continue this story at ForbesREAD MORE TSA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire TSA FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 16, 2017",move transportation security authority move id card biometrics technology order board implementation state art card system teeth id act phase militarization passport travel beginning flight board airplane state security form identification resident card card id act state security government id act effect time passport airport security emphasis driver license id state compliant id act state extension compliance id information list visit passport air travel check government office type id situation enforcement effect people passport transportation security administration flight state id state passport country travel story news century wire subscribe member
7670, Trump Was So Desperate During Last Debate He Broke The Rules To Ask For Help,"CNN Money has released a report saying that Donald Trump violated Fox News  rules during the last Republican primary debate.The claim comes from an unnamed rival campaign. Apparently Trump consulted with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, during Thursday s debate in Detroit. This is a clear violation of the rules that were set before the debate. What s even more interesting, is that the report indicates that this is not the first time Trump has broken debate rules. This is just the most egregious example.CNN Money reports: While that exchange was the clearest violation of debate rules to date, the sources said, it followed a pattern: At multiple debates, Trump has consulted with his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski backstage even though it was expressly forbidden by the networks.Thursday night s debate in Detroit marked a new extreme, however, as Lewandowski went directly onto the stage to meet with Trump during the commercial break. As in previous debates, Fox News had explicitly informed the campaigns that candidates were not allowed to communicate with their campaign staff during commercial breaks, the sources said.When Lewandowski was asked by Fox News staff to leave the stage, he refused to do so, according to a source at Fox News.Unable to get Lewandowski off the stage, Fox News representatives informed the other three campaigns that, because the Trump campaign had broken the rules, they too could consult with their candidates. It isn t surprising that Trump would need assistance during a debate. Not to imply that any of the Republican candidates are particularly better than Trump, in terms of policy, but Trump can barely string together enough words to create a cohesive sentence. Trump isn t a politician; he is a has been reality television star used to having people feed him lines. This just proves that he will do or so anything to become president.Featured image from Gage Skidmore via Flickr",News,"March 5, 2016",money report trump news debate claim rival campaign campaign manager debate violation debate report time trump debate example money exchange violation debate date pattern trump campaign manager backstage night debate extreme stage trump break news campaign staff news staff stage source news stage news trump campaign surprising trump assistance debate trump policy trump sentence trump politician television star people anything president image gage

7025, Bernie Sanders Was Once A Talk Show Host – Here Are His Finest Moments (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders has done plenty of things in his life. From civil rights activist to U.S. senator and now to presidential candidate, Bernie has always figured out a way to create a platform that allows him to advocate for issues that are important to America. What many of us didn t know was that while mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders was also a host of a cable access show.NBC s Late Night host Seth Meyers reminded Bernie of those days when he showed a reel of the former mayor out and about talking to constituents. Meyers said: I want to ask you one last thing. If you were elected president, would you do what you did when you were mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and would you host a public access show? Before you answer, we actually have footage of a show you hosted as mayor in Burlington. Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YBQHXMfFhY]Of course, Sanders couldn t keep a straight face and it was hilarious watching Bernie introduce himself as Dan Rather in one of the clips or have an awkward but funny moment with one interviewee.It would be great to see Sanders go out into the public once in a while and do similar interviews with constituents if he becomes president of the United States, a proposition that is becoming more likely as of late as Sanders has surged in the polls, winning many states to date.Featured image via video screenshot.

750, WAPO: Trump Planning To Go Around Senate To Replace Sessions With A Loyal Stooge,"Donald Trump is very busy right now trying to get rid of his Attorney General, one Jeff Sessions. This is pretty extraordinary, since Sessions endorsed Trump while the rest of the elected Republican establishment was still treating Trump s candidacy with a mix of comedy and horror. Now, however, times have changed. Trump wants Sessions gone, due his firm (and possibly true) belief that Sessions  decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.As Mueller digs further into Trump World   including into Trump s finances, which Trump himself has said is some kind of red line   Trump is looking for a way to rid himself of the threat of what Mueller might find. With Sessions recused, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the one who would have the authority to fire Robert Mueller. Rosenstein has gone on the record under oath as saying that he will do no such thing without just cause. The solution to all of this for Trump? Get rid of Sessions and Rosenstein, and appoint an Attorney General who will be a staunch and unwavering Trump loyalist.It has been speculated that Trump is considering that former New York Mayor and fervent Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani might be just the man to do this. However, there is just one problem with that: Giuliani likely wouldn t pass the Senate confirmation process in this climate. In order to appear non-partisan, even Senate Republicans would insist on a nominee who is not an obvious Trump stalwart. Plus, Rudy Giuliani already admitted on the air that he literally tried to help Trump find a way to ban Muslims from the nation without doing so explicitly so as to pass Constitutional muster. Then there was the time during the campaign when Giuliani seemed to know what would be in a batch of hacked anti-Hillary Clinton emails that were leaked shortly after his statements. So, yeah, big confirmation problems there.So, what s Trump to do? Well, that s easy. Go around the Senate completely and install any Attorney General he wants, by appointing someone during the recess that the Senate always takes in late summer. Problem solved. According to the Washington Post, Team Trump is considering doing just that, when it comes to weighing options to get a pro-Trump Attorney General. From WaPo:Another scenario is that Trump could make a recess appointment, said University of Texas School of Law professor Steve Vladeck. Under that plan, Trump could choose an attorney general during the August recess who would serve until the end of the next Senate session, which could be early January. That person would have the same authority as someone who is confirmed by the Senate, Vladeck said.Now obviously such a move would be nothing short of the height of corruption, and politically explosive for Congressional Republicans, especially if they don t warn him against doing this. We all know that Trump and the people in the White House don t care how something like that looks. They want Robert Mueller and his Russia investigation gone at all costs, and if it means looking guilty as hell to do it, so be it. Anyone who has paid attention knows that Rudy Giuliani would have absolutely no issue following a Trump order to fire Robert Mueller. He d relish the task, in fact, because that would put him in the highest regard in Trump World   perhaps permanently.Republicans, if this shit goes down like this, it s on your heads. It would literally spin us into a full-fledged Constitutional crisis. If Trump moves to fire Mueller, you need to impeach him. Period.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 24, 2017",trump attorney jeff sessions sessions trump rest establishment trump candidacy mix comedy horror times trump sessions firm belief sessions decision russia investigation appointment counsel world trump kind line trump way threat sessions deputy attorney rod one authority record oath thing solution trump sessions appoint attorney general staunch trump loyalist trump york mayor trump supporter man problem pass senate confirmation process climate order partisan nominee trump stalwart air way nation muster time campaign batch confirmation trump senate attorney general someone recess senate summer problem post team trump trump attorney general scenario trump recess appointment university school law professor plan attorney general recess end senate session person authority someone senate move nothing height corruption trump people house something russia investigation hell anyone attention issue order task fact regard world crisis period image chip

4148, Howard Stern: Having Trump On My Show To Demean Women With Sex Talk Was No Accident,"Time and time again, Donald Trump appeared on the Howard Stern Show. During his interviews, he rated women on a scale from one to ten, told Stern it was okay to call his daughter Ivanka a  piece of ass,  and bragged about his own sex life. (I ll wait while you gag.) These comments have come back to bite Trump in his orange derriere repeatedly throughout his run for the White House.Howard Stern, who happens to be a Democrat, is finally commenting on the impact his past shows have had on this year s election. He said that having the billionaire on his show to talk about sex and degrade women was no accident, Trump fit the part by nature. Stern also said that he was not replaying the tapes of the GOP nominee s old interviews because he considers Trump a friend and doing so would be a  betrayal. Donald Trump did the show in an effort to be entertaining and have fun with us,  Stern said on his Sirius satellite radio show.  I fully knew what I was doing when I interviewed Trump. I knew I had a guy who loved to talk about sex.   I had a guy who loved to evaluate women on a scale of 1 to 10. These are avenues I went down because I knew it would entertain the audience. Stern said that he was stunned that the tapes from his show hadn t surfaced earlier. He added that he had asked Trump what the heck he was thinking when he launched his bid for the presidency. I said,  Why are you doing this? Why would a guy with billions of dollars (run for president)?   Don t you know what they re gonna do to you? Don t you know they re gonna open up everything?' The shock jock also weighed in on the  Pu**ygate  tapes that recently turned up in which Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because he is  a star.  Stern is known for his raunchiness, but even he said that Trump s locker room talk  defense was a load of crap.

7841, Scathing New Amnesty International Report Calls For End To Israeli War Crimes (IMAGE/VIDEO),"On February 25, 1994, Israeli-Zionist terrorist Barch Goldstein walked into the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Palestinian city of Khalil (Hebron) and executed 29 kneeling Palestinian worshipers and wounded another 129. Soon after, protests broke out in the city and at least 20 more Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers guarding the illegal Jewish settlers Israel implanted in the city. Israel also imposed a permanent closure on Al-Shuhada Street, once a bustling strip of Palestinian businesses. The street is the main road leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs and today, only Jewish Israelis are allowed access to the street, turning the area, which was once the heart of the city, into a virtual ghost town.As Palestinians mark 22 years since the massacre at the mosque and the closure of Al-Shuhada Street, Amnesty International is calling on Israel to lift their military restrictions and collective punishment of Palestinians, a war crime under international law: Since October 2015, as violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and Israel has surged, the Israeli authorities have drastically increased the arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on movement imposed on Palestinians in and around Hebron s Old City, declaring parts of it a  closed military zone.  This has further entrenched and exacerbated a pattern of long-standing violations of the rights to freedom of movement, work, health and education of Palestinians in Hebron, especially tens of thousands residing or working in or near the Old City. The arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions, which are not applied to the Israeli Jews living in the illegal settlements in and around the city, constitute collective punishment and violate international humanitarian law. Furthermore, Palestinian and international human rights defenders, including monitors, have been prevented from accessing the areas of al-Shuhada Street and el Rumeida, and are constantly harassed by Israeli forces and settlers. In typical fashion of tyrannical states, Israel has also attacked human rights activists who have protested Israel s brutal policies toward the Palestinians. Amnesty International states: International activists and human rights defenders, who have played a crucial role for many years in documenting Israeli violations against Palestinians living in Hebron, have also been harassed and attacked by Israeli forces and settlers, and prevented from entering the area designated a closed military zone. Activists from the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) told Amnesty International in October that Israeli settlers had physically attacked them frequently, including in the presence of Israeli forces, who did not act to stop the attacks. The ISM also reported that the Israeli police arrested two international activists on 3 November 2015 at the request of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint the two activists were observing. The two were released, ISM said, when they agreed to leave the city for a week despite the Israeli police telling them there was  no evidence  against them. The report ends by pointing to Israel s colonies or what are typically referred to as settlements, which are illegal under international law, as the main source of tension in the area. Israel has built colonies and an infrastructure exclusively for Jews, stealing Palestinian land and then killing them when they resist Israel s Orwellian experiment. Amnesty International states:  The presence of illegal settlements in and around Hebron is both the cause of the long-standing human rights crisis in the city, and the primary reason for the escalating violence seen there in recent months. The settlements were established in violation of international law, their presence has resulted in grave violations of Palestinians  human rights over many years, and Israel s settlement policy is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Instead of continuing the discriminatory measures and actions that compound an illegal situation and violate Palestinians  human rights, Israel must evacuate the Israeli civilians living in the illegal settlements in and around Hebron, as well as elsewhere in the OPT.

5088, Trumps Uses KIDS As Human Shields In Latest Campaign Lie,"Donald Trump has shown throughout the presidential campaign a repeated habit of lying again and again about every issue under the sun. Trump seems to be so enamored of lying that he often does so without any logical reason behind it   even for a politician.The Associated Press did some digging into yet another Trump claim and it turns out that he s lying, this time about children.Attacking government-funded universal pre-K programs, Trump said that he favored programs administered by private businesses, instead of the government. As an example he cited programs supposedly utilized by his own businesses.He said,  They call  em Trump Kids. Another one calls it Trumpeteers, if you can believe it. I have  em. I actually have  em, because I have a lot of different businesses. But it turns out those programs aren t for Trump s employees.But the two programs Trump cited    Trump Kids  and  Trumpeteers    are programs catering to patrons of Trump s hotels and golf club. They are not for Trump s employees, according to staff at Trump s hotels and clubs across the country. Trump Kids  is described on the Trump Hotel Collection website as  a special travel program designed to help make your next family vacation a big hit.  Its offerings include  kid-friendly amenities like kiddie cocktails, coloring books and no-tear bath amenities. The Trumpeteer Program  is described on the website of Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, as  a program created specifically for our youngest members, ages three to twelve, which offers daily and evening child care, monthly newsletters and weekly events! AP also interviewed Trump employees and asked if they provide child care. They said no. The AP also checked out employee handbooks from Trump s business, and none of them mention child care services. When they asked the campaign about the candidate s lie, they responded with a stock statement and avoided answering the question directly.It s just one more example of how Trump and his campaign is trying to lie its way into the White House.

14873,MUSLIM CONGRESSMAN Abruptly Leaves DC: Uses Finely Honed Divisive Race Skills To Lead Fight Against Cops In MN,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is more than just a radical activist, he s also a devout Muslim U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison abruptly left Washington earlier this month to fly back to Minneapolis and emerged at the center of explosive confrontations between black activists and police outside the Fourth Precinct station.In those first, uncertain days after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in north Minneapolis, Ellison displayed credibility among different factions of the black community, and also had stature in the mayor s office and could help broker a sit-down meeting between Gov. Mark Dayton and the family of the shooting victim, Jamar Clark.The unrest has elevated Ellison s profile, but it has also become his biggest test yet as a political leader trying to negotiate a truce in the latest flare-up of long-running tensions between police and the local black community. People have successfully gotten the attention of political leadership,  Ellison said from the protest site, less than a mile from his home.  We just have to make sure we do not waste it, and we make sure we gather it up and turn it into some tangible benefits for the people here. Striking a tone that was conciliatory but also challenging, he added:  There s absolutely no doubt that we have to get established, responsive government. The unrest hit uncomfortably close to home for the fifth-term Democrat just a few days after the shooting. During a particularly fraught night, his son, Jeremiah, was photographed with his hands up as police in riot gear pointed a gun toward him and other protesters. Ellison later shared the photo on his Twitter account, calling it  agonizing.  It was retweeted nearly 4,000 times.Behind the scenes, Ellison, 52, has been navigating several constituencies, including the governor s office, city officials, progressive allies and black activists who themselves are split over how to best accomplish their goals. Some black community members say they hope the shooting will finally get the attention of state leaders, whom they say have allowed Minnesota s racial disparities to fester for decades.Those connected to Ellison say his latest role is one that he has honed after years of deep involvement in divisive racial issues around Minneapolis. They say he radiates a cool confidence in person, and is enormously skilled at connecting with people in the midst of conflicts. People who don t know him, especially from outside of Minneapolis, see a firebrand out in the streets, playing that one really important role he plays, rallying the community to be empowered,  former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak said.  The other role that most people don t see, that I have the benefit of, is a very savvy adviser who would never moderate his views but would bring a sophisticated understanding of how government worked.   For entire story: Star TribuneSo who exactly is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) and why do Muslim lawmakers like hime and Andre Carson (D-IN) in America matter?Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is perhaps the most well known Muslim in the U.S. Congress but he s not the only one. The other is Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN). While speaking at the ICNA-MAS convention, Carson told those in attendance that America s schools should be  modeled  after  madrassas  (Islamic schools).Incidentally, the ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America) was identified in a 1991 Muslim Brotherhood document as one of 29  like minded  organizations. The goal of these organizations? According to the document itself: their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house by their hands   so that   God s religion [Islam] is made victorious over all other religions. MAS (Muslim American Society) was formed in 1992, one year after the date of the document, which might explain why they weren t one of the 29. Bolstering that case further is the fact that MAS has identified two groups who are on the list of the notorious 29   Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and Muslim Students Association (MSA) as being like-minded.So, as DHS is more concerned with  rightwing extremism  than it is with Jihad, a sitting U.S. Congressman is a featured speaker at a convention filled with those who want to destroy Western civilization (America) from within. Watch Muslim Congressman Andre Carson bemoan the lack of Muslims in lawmaking roles.

Given the current political climate, I believe it s important that a voice of faith representing the transgender and gender non-conforming community   as well as a person of my years, nearly 82   be present and heard in these vital conversations,  Satin said in a statement published through the United Church of Christ.

15366,UNREAL! GRIFTER BILL CLINTON MAKES $16 MILLION FROM PEOPLE IN HIGH GOVERNMENT PLACES,"Newly released financial disclosures reveal Bill Clinton received $16.46 million in payments from a George Soros-backed for-profit education company, as Hillary Clinton s State Department funneled tens of millions of dollars to a group run by the company s chairman.With $4 billion in annual revenue, Laureate Education is America s largest for-profit college company. From 2010 until just days before the 2015 release of Clinton Cash, Bill Clinton served as Laureate s  honorary chancellor.  When the Clinton campaign team obtained a copy of the book and its Clinton-Laureate connection revelation, Bill Clinton abruptly resigned.Laureate s chairman and longtime Clinton crony, Douglas Becker, is also the chairman of a nonprofit sister organization called the International Youth Foundation (IYF). Indeed, IYF s offices are less than a mile from Laureate s in Baltimore. Shortly after Laureate made Bill Clinton its honorary chancellor in April 2010, Hillary Clinton made Laureate part of her State Department Global Partnership. IYF received USAID funds before Hillary s tenure at the State Dept. But the grants the group received exploded after Bill Clinton was put on the Laureate payroll.According to a Bloomberg analysis of the Clinton Cash revelation:  In 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate, the nonprofit received 11 grants worth $9 million from the State Department or the affiliated USAID. In 2010, the group received 14 grants worth $15.1 million. In 2011, 13 grants added up to $14.6 million. The following year, those numbers jumped: IYF received 21 grants worth $25.5 million, including a direct grant from the State Department.

8409, Bigots Upset Their Daughter Was Taught World History Suing Maryland Public School,"John and Melissa Wood are typical right-wing loons. After their daughter told them about her class assignments, John Wood set off to LaPlata High School in Maryland in a fit of rage. His daughter, it seems, was taught about Islam as part of a world history course, which didn t sit well with the bigoted former marine or his wife.According to the Woods, their daughter was forced to accept Islam as her one true religion and was forced to memorize the five tenets of the faith. They argued that the class only spent a single day on Christianity and then moved on to two weeks of Islamic training.Learning to recite things in the course of a history class is what most people would call  studying,  but the dad found it so vile that she was being forced to convert to Islam that he went to the school and threatened the faculty, resulting in an immediate ban from the property and a no trespass order from local law enforcement.While the school contends that the reality of the situation doesn t fit the narrative the bigots have concocted, the Woods have decided to sue the school with the help of the Thomas Moore Law Center, the right-wing crackpot firm that unsuccessfully argues for intelligent design and Christian indoctrination in schools on a regular basis. The center said in court filings: A school cannot achieve diversity by punishing and alienating students who hold Judeo-Christian beliefs, while bolstering the doctrines and teachings of other religions. Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it. Yeah, that s not at all what s going on. As the school explained in a statement to WTOP: The particular unit in question is on the formation of Middle Eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it, along with politics, culture, economics and geography, contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example, when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation, students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India, students examine Hinduism and Buddhism It doesn t matter how you try to explain teaching Islam to right-wing imbeciles. They see all Muslims as a threat the them. They hear the word  Muslim  in a public school and their heads explode, because the 1st Amendment says no religion in public places. Now tell that teacher to lead those kids in christian prayer before it s too late for them.The most ridiculous argument the suit brings is this: The course also taught false statements such as Allah is the same God worshiped by Christians and Islam is a  religion of peace' According to these people a religion of a billion people are out to kill us all. Considering if that were true they would only have to get about 6 people each to kill all non-Muslims, you have to wonder why it hasn t happened already. You also have to wonder how people can continue to call Islam a  pagan  religion when the tribe Mohammed came from was directly descended from Ishmael, son of Abraham, considered the steward of the faith to his tribe and brother of Isaac, patriarch of Judaism.I learned that from a high school world history course.The Woods are asking for injunctive relief barring the teaching of anything that has to with Islam from school grounds and for the trespass order to be lifted. It shouldn t be long before this case, much like all of the other zealot-friendly issues brought by the Moore Center.Featured image from Wikipedia",News,"January 31, 2016",wood wing daughter class wood school fit rage daughter part world history course sit marine wife daughter religion faith class day training course history class people dad school faculty ban property trespass order law enforcement school reality situation school help law wing crackpot firm design indoctrination basis center court filings school cannot diversity indoctrination guise history country action school statement unit question formation faith politics culture economics geography development east era region example renaissance reformation role development china matter threat word school amendment religion teacher prayer argument suit course god religion peace people religion people people people religion tribe son steward faith tribe brother patriarch school world history course relief teaching anything school grounds trespass order case zealot center image
4931, Ana Navarro Lets Trump Know EXACTLY What Latinos ‘Have To Lose’ By Voting For Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his campaign know that they stand an ice cube s chance in hell at winning the presidential election unless they can sway some of the minority vote. As it stands now the campaign has next to nothing in the realm of that voting block.So, what is Trump doing to try to get some of that vote? He s pandering to African-Americans and Latinos, of course. However, he s doing a terrible job of it.He s literally asking minority voters: What do you have to lose? As though that s all the reasoning they d ever need to vote for him. As if minority voters are going to show up to the voting booth in November, look at the ballot, and say,  eh, why not Trump? What do I have to lose? Well, the answer to that is everything considering Trump is currently endorsed by white supremacists and has regularly compared Latinos to rapists and murderers.Does Trump really think that line is going to work? I mean, he can t be that dumb, right? Who knows, really. Clearly, his current supporters are.Well, not letting Trump get away with being such a pathetic pandering fool, Ana Navarro, a conservative mind you, tells Trump exactly what they have to lose.On CNN Navarro stated: I don t speak for all Hispanics. I speak for myself. Maybe the eighty plus percent of Hispanics who don t approve of him, some of them may agree with me. I think what we have to lose, is our dignity. Our sense of self-worth. I think what we have to lose is our moral compass. I think that if we allow ourselves to vote for a man who has been making textbook racist remarks, and in my book that makes him a racist, for over a year, against Hispanics. Against immigrants. You are voting against your own self-interests. I think that we would lose our political leverage. We would lose any power. If we allow somebody who has been bashing us for over a year to win the presidency. It means the Hispanic vote does not matter. So, that s my answer to Donald Trump. What do we have to lose by voting for you? Our dignity. It really doesn t get more perfect than that. Well said, Ana.Watch Navarro explain what Latinos have to lose by voting for Trump here:.@ananavarro's answer to Donald Trump: ""What we have to lose by voting for you?

14560,“TEFLON” TRUMP WINS SUPPORT From Unlikely Groups Of Voters,"Trump is winning support from latinos and from Union Members   two groups that typically vote Democrat. What is it about this candidate? We d love to know your thoughts. This has been an interesting election year so far and will only get crazier. It s a turning point Trump has support from 38 percent of Latino voters followed by Ted Cruz with 15 percent and Jeb Bush with 14 percent. The New York Post reported:Thirty eight percent favor Trump, followed by Cuban American Ted Cruz (15 percent), Jeb Bush (14 percent) and Cuban American Marco Rubio (8 percent), according to the national poll conducted by the Beck Research for the American Federation for Children. If you re trying to stop Trump   this poll should trouble you,  said pollster Deborah Beck.From Day 1 of his presidential campaign, Trump got into hot water with Hispanic organizations for asserting many Mexican immigrants are rapists, criminals and drug dealers. His campaign has since gained steam for his tough talk on building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it and implementing a temporary ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. This poll finds that he s building a committed base of voters. Trump is proving to be Teflon, and despite his statements about Hispanic voters, 38 percent of Hispanic Republicans back him,  said Beck, president of Beck Research LLC.The other group that s an unlikely supporter is the Union vote:In September, union leaders rocked the political world by suggesting Hillary would not just automatically get their nod; that Republican candidate Donald Trump could be in play for their consideration, in part due to Hillary s rejection of the Keystone Pipeline, while Mr. Trump supports it.Mr. Trump has a history of dealing with Unions on his real estate projects around the country.The source of the attraction to Mr. Trump, say union members and leaders, is manifold: the candidate s unapologetically populist positions on certain economic issues, particularly trade; a frustration with the impotence of conventional politicians; and above all, a sense that he rejects the norms of Washington discourse. They feel he s the one guy who s saying what s on people s minds.

11011,“WHOSE STREETS?” NOT YOURS! NC Passes Law Shielding Drivers Who Hit Protesters Blocking Roads [VIDEO],"Soros paid protesters who blocked streets and created mass chaos in big cities cashed in before the election of President Trump. For the most part, when protesters blocked miles of traffic in large cities, law enforcement officers, who were also their target (thanks to another Soros-Obama effort) protected them from being unintentionally struck by vehicles on roads and highways they were blocking. Stories of people rushing to the hospital or trying to make it to work on time were circulating all over social media. Of course the mainstream media and leftist news sources were in collusion with Democrats in their efforts to threaten and shame Americans who dared to support Trump. They foolishly believed their violent and unlawful behavior would sway voters. In addition to putting people s lives in danger, In the end, Obama and George Soros  thugs turned a lot of people away from the polls, as many Democrat and independent voters didn t want to be tied to a party they no longer recognized.Watch protesters yell,  Whose streets? Our streets! :Just before the midnight curfew in #CLT the crowd is at the Square chanting. Doesn t look like they want to go home. #KeithScottA post shared by David Boraks (@davidboraks) on Sep 23, 2016 at 8:56pm PDTWatch anti-Trump Antifa terrorists take over major streets in DC chanting  Our streets! NC lawmakers are taking action to protect innocent drivers who encounter protesters who think jumping in front of traffic is a great way to protest. And oh yeah they re not your streets the streets belong to all Americans.WFAE   Stop me if you ve heard this one before. The North Carolina House has passed a bill that is sure to bring controversy.This measure shields drivers who hit protesters from lawsuits.Last year, in the wake of the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, protesters took over Charlotte city streets, even marching down sections of I-277 and I-85.The often chanted  Who s street? Our street! All this caught the attention of Republican Representative Justin Burr of Montgomery County.  As we ve seen, time and time again, as folks run out in the middle of the streets and the interstates in Charlotte and attempt to block traffic,  Burr said as he introduced the bill. He wants to ensure  drivers don t have to fear driving through Charlotte or anywhere in North Carolina. Now there are many ways this could be done.But Burr decided to go in a controversial direction with House Bill 330.He explains the bill this way,  provides that a person driving an automobile while exercising due care is immune for civil liability for any injury to another if the injured person was participating in a demonstration or protest and blocking traffic. Translation: a driver who hits, or even runs over, a protester on a street could be shielded from lawsuits by the person they injure.But Burr wanted to be clear on one point.  Now this bill does not allow for a driver of a vehicle to target protesters intentionally. That obviously is not the intention. Watch what happens here when protesters block a car that is on its way to St. Jude s Children s Hospital with a sick child: In other words, if you were trying to get from point A to point B and you just happen to hit a protester, or more, while driving through a demonstration, you would be protected from civil lawsuits. We all know this is being done to try to make a point about protests,  said Democrat Greg Meyer. He s just one of the lawmakers who saw a problem with this bill.  It is just going to embarrass us. There is no good reason to pass this bill. The bill has passed the North Carolina House. It now heads to the Senate.

6380, Watch This Bible-Waving ‘Christian’ Lady March Through Target Ranting About Devil Rape (VIDEO),"The GOP was right. Thanks to Target s decision to let transgender people use the bathroom in which they feel most comfortable, all sorts of weirdos are showing up. No, we re not talking about people going into the ladies  room to pee. Recently, a creepy new trend has been spreading through the Christian Right like chlamydia through a Texas school that teaches abstinence-only sex education. Christians have been marching through Target stores across the nation whole screaming about how evil it is to allow human beings to go to the bathroom without feeling out of place.In one video, a Bible-waving mother marches through a Target store with her husband and children in tow to let people know what she views as the truth about Target s evil bathroom policy: Attention Target customers: Do not be deceived. Target would have you believe that they love mothers and children. This is a deception. This is not love, and they ve proven it by opening their bathrooms to perverted men. I am a mother of 12,  she announces with her Bible raised in the air,  and I am very disgusted by this wicked practice. Target does not protect mothers and children. Mothers, get your children out of this store,  she commanded.  Mother, have enough decency to get out of this store. It s a dangerous place.  She added that Target s inclusive policy is  hateful  toward families, children, and mothers. Then things got REALLY crazy: America, when are you going to wake up? When are you going to stand up for the right things, America? Are you going to let the Devil rape your children, America? It s time to stand up and have a voice instead of bowing to the homosexual perverted agenda that s taking over this nation? You need to run and flee this place. I wouldn t spend a penny of my money here. This is wicked. This is confusion. This is twisted. This is abominable in the sight of God. Transgender people have been using public bathrooms for an untold length of time. It s never been an issue until Republicans decided it was more important of an issue than poverty, our crumbling infrastructure, educating our children, or even remembering to put the toilet seat down (sorry honey). What is most unfortunate is that this woman took her children along with her on this insane and hateful escapade. It is unknown how much damage she is doing to her children by teaching them nothing but hatred.Republicans were right: creeps are flooding into Target.

8355, Watch Pres Jimmy Carter Go Beast Mode On Republican Candidates (VIDEO),"Former president Jimmy Carter denounced what he called the  legal bribery afflicting our political system, turning the presidential race into one that is influenced by a few billionaires, lobby groups, and corporate oligarchs who sponsor candidates by giving billions in exchange for influencing the candidates  policy platform. In an interview with the BBC, Carter said: The erroneous ruling of the Supreme Court, where millionaires and billionaires can put in unlimited amounts of money in to the campaign, it gives legal bribery a chance to prevail, because almost all the candidates, whether they are honest or not, Democrat or Republican, rely on these massive amounts of money in order to campaign. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFc1QqRbbQ] President Carter has a very important point and one that should be taken into account: The democracy of the country is threatened and eroded when an elected official, especially a president, owes a handful of individuals who finance his/her presidential campaign favors.Take for example, the NRA. The NRA is a very well funded and organized lobby group that lobbies Washington officials in favor of lax guns laws. That, in turn, means easier access to guns, which translates into sales. Some people get rich as a result of gun sales, but the country collectively suffers, as has been documented, with record numbers of shootings around the country.Another example is individual donations. Republican candidate Marco Rubio s sponsor, the billionaire Norman Braman, has donated $15-25 million to Rubio s campaign. Braman is staunchly pro-Israel and has financed the building of settlements in the Palestinian West Bank. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, and US policy condemns settlement building in the West Bank. Yet, you can bet that if Rubio should become president, Braman will cash in his chips by ensuring that Rubio goes along with Israel s illegal activities. In the end, we will continue to have a mess in the Middle Eat, which hurts the region and the United States.The bottom line is that billions of dollars are being spent by candidates to win the presidency and much of that money comes from a few individuals. The only way to change that is to create a constitutional amendment that overturns the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that allows individuals and corporations to contribute unlimited sums to political races. Until we do this, a small number of individuals and corporations will continue to exert undemocratic influence over our country.

15766,"GANGSTA GOV ATTEMPTS SHAKEDOWN OF GIANT MORTGAGE COMPANY, Quicken Loans…Owner Stands His Ground","Quicken Loans owner, Dan Gilbert is one of the most beloved business owners in the state of MI. Their headquarters are located in the city of Detroit (where people in the suburbs don t typically travel unless they have to). Owner, Dan Gilbert gives back to the city of Detroit and to its residents in a huge way, not the least of which is employing over 7,000 people in their Detroit offices. In 2014, Fortune Magazine named Quicken Loans a  Top 5 Place To Work  for the 11th straight year. When asked what made Quicken Loans such a great place to work, Fortune gave this answer: America s largest online-lending company offers cash incentives to its staff to move to downtown Detroit. According to Salary.com, mortgage bankers in Southeast Michigan average $50,000 a year, but those at Quicken earn $113,000. None of that matters to a corrupt government however, who has a history of shaking down banks. This time however, the goons in our Justice Department may have targeted the wrong business owner.Detroit s own Quicken Loans is the latest target of the Justice Department s shakedown of the nation s lenders.Justice s goons have been systematically extorting protection money from big banks and mortgage lenders, under the threat of federal fraud lawsuits and prison time for their executives.The department s modus operandi would be worthy of racketeering charges if carried out by civilian mobsters.First, the Obama administration whips up a blame-the-banks fervor after the financial collapse. Then, armed with federal fraud statutes adopted after the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s, it scours the transactions of lenders to find hints of irregularities. It extrapolates from the skimpiest evidence a pattern of widespread abuse, and if needed, frightens insiders into coughing up creative accusations against their employers.With its  proof  in hand, Justice presents institutions with a choice   pay a large and painful fine to make the investigation go away, or try their luck at a jury trial in an environment in which the words  bankers  and  baby killers  register about the same revulsion.The nation s six largest banks have all crumbled, choosing to pay $136 billion in fines and admit their  wrongdoing  rather than get their legs broken.Quicken, owned by Dan Gilbert, has decided not to cower, at least for the moment. Instead of paying protection money, it filed a lawsuit to stop a three-year investigation. Thursday, the government responded by filing charges against Quicken, accusing it of submitting ineligible mortgages for FHA insurance.In its complaint, Quicken says Justice demanded a multi-billion dollar settlement based on a sampling of just 55 of the 246,000 loans issued. Defects, according to the lawsuit, include miscalculating a borrower s income by $17 and lending another $26 too much. In those meager mistakes, Justice sees systemic fraud.Trace evidence is all the Obama administration requires to put banks on the rack. To cinch a settlement, Justice adds the threat of criminal charges against individual executives.Quicken s lawsuit accuses the government of  investigating and pressuring large, high-profile lenders into paying nine- and 10-figure sums and publicly admitting wrongdoing, including conceding that the lenders had made false claims.  That s an exellent summary of Justice s racket.Requiring a public admission of wrongdoing, instead of allowing institutions to settle without acknowledging guilt, as is common practice, leaves open the possibility of future criminal action against executives, assuring that they don t squawk publicly.Gilbert is a different cat than Justice has crossed on Wall Street. Detroit street tough, he doesn t take to being bullied. Of course, the government has a lot of pressure points it can mash. Gilbert is in the gaming business, a highly regulated industry, and the administration is not above targeting his casinos.But I hope he hangs in there. This government has gone gangster, and unless someone takes a stand, it won t be just the big bankers who get pinched.Via: Nolan Finley, Detroit News",politics,"Apr 28, 2015",owner dan gilbert business state mi headquarters city people owner dan gilbert city way people magazine place year place answer company cash staff mortgage southeast year none government history time justice department business owner target justice department shakedown nation protection money mortgage threat fraud prison time department racketeering administration blame collapse fraud loan evidence pattern abuse proof hand justice choice pay fine investigation luck jury trial environment baby revulsion nation choosing wrongdoing dan gilbert moment protection money lawsuit year investigation government insurance complaint quicken justice dollar settlement sampling lawsuit borrower income justice fraud trace evidence administration rack settlement justice threat lawsuit government profile figure summary justice racket admission guilt practice possibility action squawk gilbert cat justice wall street street take course government lot pressure gilbert gaming business industry administration hope government gangster someone stand news
15262,MUST SEE RESULTS OF NEW POLL Asking Americans One Word They Associate With Hillary,"Somehow we don t think this is what the Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate expected at this stage of her campaign The latest Q-poll numbers have dropped and there aren t really a lot of surprises in the top lines. (Well  there are a couple of exceptions but we ll get to those in a minute.) What was really startling, though, was the results of the  open ended  questions about several of the candidates. Most specifically, the massively leading, top of the list responses for Hillary Clinton have to be giving her team nightmares. (Connecticut Post  emphasis added)Clinton leads the Democratic field with 45 percent, down from 55 percent July 30, with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent and Biden at 18 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent with 11 percent undecided. This is Sanders  highest tally and closest margin.Clinton tops the Democrats   no way  list with 11 percent. Liar  is the first word that comes to mind more than others in an open-ended question when voters think of Clinton.  Arrogant  is the word for Trump and voters say  Bush  when they think of Bush. Here s the high end of the list.Holy cow. You get 394 responses just by combining the top three results of  Liar, Dishonest and Untrustworthy.  You pretty much have to add up all of the other words on the list to catch up with those three. And this isn t just a list of responses by Republicans  that s everyone. What s truly amazing is that this is clearly the prevailing American perception at this point and yet, Clinton is still the Democrat frontrunner.

17265,MORE TRANSPARENCY: CLINTON’S REFUSE TO RELEASE HILLARY’S HEALTH RECORDS,"Karl Rove is suggesting Hillary suffered brain damage following her blood clot.On Sunday, Hillary Clinton s campaign manager would not commit to releasing her health records during the 2016 campaign.Face the Nation host John Dickerson pointed out that  Hillary Clinton had a big health scare when she was secretary of state  and asked campaign manager Robby Mook,  will she release her medial records as part of this campaign? I will let Hillary decide that,  Mook answered.  But I can tell you she has been hitting the campaign trail hard. In 2012, Clinton had to delay her Benghazi testimony to Congress after she fell and suffered a concussion. She later was treated for a blood clot in her brain, which experts said could have been  life threatening.  Though Clinton joked about her  cracked head  in emails that the State Department recently released, Bill Clinton revealed last year that Hillary s injuries  required six months of very serious work to get over. On the stump this weekend, Clinton tried to deflect concerns about her age by saying that she would be the  youngest woman president  if elected to the White House.Via:Breitbart News",Government News,"Jun 16, 2015",rove brain damage blood clot campaign manager health campaign nation host health scare secretary state campaign manager part campaign campaign hard testimony congress concussion blood clot brain life head state department bill year work stump weekend age woman president house news

6373, Scott Baio Emerges From 1940s Mob Film To Tell Fox News Why He Wants Trump (VIDEO),"One of the great mysteries of the universe is trying to figure out what makes people who otherwise may seem rational like and support Donald Trump for president. Appearing on Fox News, actor Scott Baio let us in on why he supports the real estate mogul, and why others should as well. Although, he seems to just be emerging from the set of a 1940s mob themed movie.When asked why he likes Trump, Baio said: What do I like about Trump? There s no BS. I understand him when he talks. Whomever the Democrat nominee is, he s gonna beat the crap out of  em. Which is what we need. Instead of the crap beat out of us, and I like his policy proposals. What policy proposals? He s been all over the map on pretty much everything, except for his hatred of Muslims and that damn border wall.After being asked why people want Trump, he said: Well I think the thing is that Trump is not a typical Republican. He s sort of, you can t put a label on the guy, which I love. And because the media has stigmatized the Republican brand, he s smart to not cozy up to these guys, and he s unique. He s refreshing. He s exciting. I love to hear him talk, and I m excited about the guy. First of all,  refreshing,  really? Secondly, the media has not stigmatized the Republican brand, they did that to themselves by hating every minority group, the LGBT community, women s rights, and the poor. Blaming the media for reporting what they do is like blaming the guy who called 911 on the fire you set. Nah, it doesn t work that way.Baio clearly likes Trump, but also clearly doesn t understand anything of which he speaks.Check out the interview here:.@ScottBaio:  Whomever the Democrat nominee is, [DJT s] going to beat the crap out of them.  https://t.co/xQbQYNRVrJhttps://t.co/wmwgfpT70E  Fox News (@FoxNews) May 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016",universe people president news actor estate set mob movie trump trump democrat nominee crap em crap policy policy map everything hatred damn border wall people trump thing trump republican sort label guy love media brand unique guy media brand minority group community media guy fire work way trump anything interview democrat nominee crap news image video screen capture

The police van driver hasn t given testimony yet so perhaps he can shed some light on what happened to Freddie Gray An investigation into the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray has found no evidence that his fatal injuries were caused during the videotaped arrest and interaction with police officers, according to multiple law enforcement sources.The sources spoke to ABC7 News after being briefed on the findings of a police report turned over to prosecutors on Thursday.  Sources said the medical examiner found Gray s catastrophic injury was caused when he slammed into the back of the police transport van, apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van.Details surrounding exactly what caused Gray to slam into the back of the van was unclear. The officer driving the van has yet to give a statement to authorities. It s also unclear whether Gray s head injury was voluntary or was a result of some other action.The medical examiner s office declined to comment on this open investigation and said it does not release preliminary findings.

3593, Trump Just Caused A Diplomatic Crisis With China Because He Wants To Build A Resort In Taiwan,"Donald Trump likely caused a diplomatic crisis with China when he decided he would talk to the president of Taiwan on Friday. The move left political observers scratching their heads and wondering how he could have possibly thought this was a good idea. The answer is simple. It s the same reason Trump does everything   he thinks he can get something out of it. In this case, another luxury resort.In 1979, the United States severed all diplomatic ties with Taiwan and adopted a One China stance. Since that time, no president (or president-elect) has spoken with the country s president. As far as China is concerned, Taiwan is part of China. Trump s phone call with Tsai Ying-wen, the president of Taiwan,  is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards the island as a renegade province. So why on earth would Trump do something like this? Go figure, the Trump Organization just happens to be looking at Taiwan as a location for their next luxury resort.The Shangiist, a publication that covers news in China, reported the following in November:The mayor of Taoyuan confirmed rumors on Wednesday that US president-elect Donald Trump was considering constructing a series of luxury hotels and resorts in the northwest Taiwanese city.A representative from the Trump Organization paid a visit to Taoyuan in September, expressing interest in the city s Aerotropolis, a large-scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on Taoyuan s status as a transport hub for East Asia, Taiwan News reports. With the review process for the Aerotropolis still underway, Taoyuan s mayor referred to the subject of the meeting as mere investment speculation. Other reports indicate that Eric Trump, the president-elect s second son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, will be coming to Taoyuan later this year to discuss the potential business opportunity.The dire consequences that could come from this simple phone conversation cannot be understated. The only thing less surprising than Trump s stupidity is his willingness to sacrifice the United States for his own selfish gains. His businesses and foreign financial ties have come under scrutiny for the conflicts of interest they create now that Trump is going to be president. He hasn t even been sworn in yet and already he is saying to hell with America for the sake of his own bank account. This is exactly why this man should not be the leader of the free world.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",News,"December 2, 2016",trump crisis china president move idea answer reason trump everything something case luxury resort china stance time president president elect country president china part china trump phone call president island renegade province earth something figure trump organization location luxury resort publication news china following mayor president trump series luxury city representative trump organization visit interest city development project status transport hub news review process mayor subject meeting investment speculation president son vice president trump organization year business opportunity dire phone conversation cannot thing trump stupidity willingness gains scrutiny interest trump president sake bank account man leader world image
2601, Unhinged Sean Spicer Lashes Out At ‘Silly’ Reporters During INSANE Press Briefing (VIDEO),"White House press secretary Sean Spicer held a press briefing today and inadvertently just handed Saturday Night Live new material. Spicer repeatedly interrupted and talked over reporters while trying to defend alleged president Donald Trump. He also had to address top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway s blunder this morning on Fox & Friends in which she literally hawked Ivanka s clothing line.A reporter asked about Trump s attacks on a federal judge this week. Part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind   he s not going to hold back when he feels passionate,  Spicer said.Other reporters asked about that, too, then the exchange became more tense. Thank you, you ve now asked the question about eight times,  Spicer said. Something she said to CNN earlier this week is that the President doesn t comment on everything,  a reporter said.  I want to contrast the President s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on Quebec s mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President, when he chooses to I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences,  Spicer interrupted.  I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say I was here!  the reporter said. I know, so why are you asking why he didn t do it when I literally stood here and did it?  Spicer asked. I m talking about the President s statement  the reporter said. I don t understand what you re asking,  Spicer replied. Kellyanne s comments were about how the President doesn t have time to tweet about everything,  the reporter said.  He s tweeting about this. He s not tweeting about something else. I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President  Spicer said. We re talking about the President s time,  the reporter said. What are you you re equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don t, I mean that s the silliest thing I ve ever heard. OK. This is silly,  Spicer said while speaking over the reporter.  Next. OK. Thank you. You ve asked your question. Thank you. Conway s bigly mistake this morning was brought up. Questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump,  a reporter said.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line here? Kellyanne has been counseled and that s all we re going to go with,  Spicer replied.  She s been counseled on that subject, and that s it.

15566,BUSTED: THE ULTIMATE COMMUNIST ORGANIZER…Evidence Shows George Soros Behind Ferguson Race Riots,"George, Barack and Hillary the axis of evil Professional race activists Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop), pictured here in Baltimore, helped whip up the Ferguson mobs. This year Fortune Magazine named these two professional activists two of the world s greatest leaders.Many conservatives rightly smelled a rat in the supposed organic race-riot movement that sprang up so quickly in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014 after the shooting death of robber Michael Brown. After burning the Ferguson and Dellwood, Missouri business districts to the ground the radical left has relentlessly sought to recreate the same discord and disinformation in various locations around the U.S. Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter protest leaders have been flown to New York, South Carolina, Milwaukee, Selma, and more recently to McKinney, Texas and Hillary s campaign relaunch in New York.Thankfully, every day patriots and online conservative investigators still fight to shine truth, anywhere  the movement  tries to sow its twisted seeds to foment anger, feed bitterness, and breed division.Much has been printed about the paid protesters and Soros connections.** Nearly half of the roughly 500 businesses operating in Ferguson and adjacent communities, such as Dellwood and Jennings, suffered property damage or lost revenue as a result of the coordinated Ferguson protests and riots.In May black Ferguson activists staged a protest at the office of MORE (Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment) to complain that the group s white leaders collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations off of the Black Lives Matter movement without paying the Black participants their fair share. It was during these protests that Ferguson activists admitted that fellow protesters were making MORE THAN $5,000 a month to disrupt cities, damage property and attack police!In response to these protests MORE released a list of names and amounts paid out to protesters and protest groups who agitated and harassed police night-after-night in Ferguson last fall and winter.The list of over 80 groups and individuals was posted on Twitter by an irate protester. Via Weasel ZippersOne of the protest leaders who showed up in Ferguson shortly after Michael Brown s death was DeRay McKesson from Minneapolis. DeRay and fellow activist Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop) were nationally recognized and celebrated by the liberal media as two of the top stars of the violent protest mob.We now know that DeRay McKesson has been working with and for Soros-funded groups since he was in junior high school. We know this because DeRay released his resume online this past weekend.DeRay says he s been living off of savings for the past nine months as he s turned up in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, Milwaukee, Selma, McKinney and this past weekend he was at Hillary Clinton s campaign relaunch in New York state.DeRay and Charles Wade, Solange Knowles s stylist, the founder of Op Help or Hush have known each other for three years. Wade and McKesson were regular Ferguson protesters. That means the two have been affiliated well before Michael Brown went on his crime spree. DeRay has used his capacity, as Charles calls it, to push  the movement s  agenda far and wide.DeRay has long been known for his skill at  community organizing .He served as president of his class at Bowdoin College, as well as president of Bowdoin Student Government. While at Bowdoin, DeRay reportedly grew close to Bowdoin President Barry Mills, whose wife, Karen Gordon Mills, served in the Obama Administration. DeRay just happened to stay on the couch of an unnamed Bowdoin alum when he first descended on Ferguson.After graduating from Bowdoin, DeRay worked for the Harlem Children s Zone, run by none other than Bowdoin alums Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada. Coincidentally, Geoffrey served on the Open Society Institute s board.Throwback, meeting HCZ's Geoff Canada. pic.twitter.com/ocyw6Yo57q  deray mckesson (@deray) February 16, 2015DeRay also worked for  the movement  linked Teach For America, another radical Soros-funded group.But DeRay s ties to Soros and  community organizing  seemingly date back even further, to McKesson s teen years, at least. Suffice it to say, DeRay has been tied to Soros for more than a decade, through many programs.Perhaps DeRay s long and numerous apparent ties to Soros explain how he was so quickly dispatched to Ferguson, Missouri to take control of the protesters and become the powerfuls  approved and promoted voice on the ground. As DeRay said,  People will come out into the streets to confront a system that is corrupt.  Yet, DeRay seems to be molded, directed, and funded by some of the most powerful men in that very  system.  It looks as if someone may be pulling the strings behind the scenes to foment rage as this astroturf anti-police movement spreads from Ferguson to other points in America.Via: Gateway PunditAND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST...Here s Deray throwing his support behind Hillary on Twitter!

That s means the state government must honor the will of the people and punish any employer that doesn t comply with the law.But Governor Paul LePage is opening the door for employers to openly ignore and defy the law, which sets a dangerous precedent that Republicans will likely employ around the nation in order to get around the minimum wage laws they hate.The strategy is simple, just don t enforce the law and let employers treat employees like slaves.And that s what LePage is toying with as he tests his strategy out for the next month.According to an announcement by the Tea Party governor,From Jan. 7, 2017, when the new minimum wage law is scheduled to go into effect, and until Jan. 31, 2017, the department will not bring enforcement actions against any employer who fails to comply with the change in the tip credit or the minimum salary requirement for overtime-exempt workers. Employers are expected to follow the law and pay the minimum hourly wage of $9.In short, when the law takes effect on January 7th, employers can ignore it at least until January 31st. That is, unless LePage decides to extend the length of the time-period, which he could do since he s an asshole.And this could end up becoming a strategy used by other Republicans in other states and even at the federal level since Donald Trump and the GOP control the government, including the Justice Department and the Labor Department.Mainers for Fair Wages campaign manager Amy Halsted blasted LePage for defying the voters and every hardworking person who desperately needs the wage increase. Governor LePage has now gone beyond ignoring the will of Maine voters and is flat-out encouraging employers to commit wage theft,  she said.  Refusing to enforce the minimum wage law, and especially the increase in the base wage for tipped workers from $3.75 to $5 an hour, is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of Mainers who are working hard and too often struggling to afford heat, food and medicine. But LePage doesn t care. In fact, he accused supporters of the minimum wage increase of  attempted murder  and said they should be put in prison. To me, when you go out and kill somebody, you go to jail,  he said.  Well, this is attempted murder in my mind because it is pushing people to the brink of survival. You know what really pushes people to the brink of survival? Not paying them enough to provide themselves with basic human needs like food, clothes, healthcare, and shelter. If anyone should be behind bars it s politicians like LePage and the greedy rich people who oppose raising the minimum wage.At some point, you can only trod over the masses for so long before they snap. Anger and desperation will boil over and the bottom line is that the working poor outnumber the wealthy few so they would be wise to take care of the people who work long hours for far less pay to help make them rich.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"December 27, 2016",strategy country people state minimum wage increase hour year point margin state government people employer comply law governor door law precedent nation order wage strategy law strategy month announcement tea party governor wage law effect department employer change tip credit requirement law wage law effect length time period strategy level trump control government justice department labor department wages campaign manager amy person wage increase governor wage theft minimum wage law increase base wage hour slap face heat food medicine care fact wage increase murder prison somebody jail murder mind people brink survival people brink survival needs food clothes shelter anyone greedy people wage point anger desperation line care people pay image
14353,“They Will Kill Him Before They Let Him Become President”,"This letter was originally attributed to well-known conservative commentator and radio talk show host, Bill Bennett. Bennett has since denied ever writing this letter. Some are saying this letter was written by Wayne Allen Root, however we can find no evidence to verify that Root wrote this letter either. We believe the letter has some outstanding points and should be read by every voter as they consider the candidate they will support for President in 2016.Here is the letter that was sent to 100% FED Up:What I see happening in a Trump Presidency:They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.Don t be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.It s about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it s in all of their interests to protect one another. It s one for all and all for one. It s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We re the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.It s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It s because most of the other politicians are part of the a good old boys club. They talk big, but they won t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations   like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there s one man who isn t beholden to anyone. There s one man who doesn t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher s union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn t need anyone s help. That means he doesn t care what the media says. He doesn t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.Don t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?First, I d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you re a good old boy, you ve got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.But Trump doesn t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama s birth certificate. He questioned Obama s college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he s doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He s questioning our relationship with Mexico; he s questioning why the border is wide open; he s questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he s questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he s questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he s questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump s election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama s records, the game is over. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That s why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.Yes, it s become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can t silence him. And they sure can t intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he s the one telling the truth .",politics,"Mar 7, 2016",letter commentator radio talk show host bill letter letter evidence root letter letter voter candidate president letter trump presidency president democrat trump trump accident people holder dynamics government business media partnership heck relationship everyone everyone people cabal crony reaction media trump fund matter media business elite understand trump joke cozy apple cart coincidence everyone part thing beholden money pharmacy oil stock barrel foundation run mill establishment money man beholden anyone man need auto teacher union service union bar association campaign billionaire tycoon maverick trump anyone help media threat people everything slave game congress purse fund executive action amnesty gay money security agency everything house speaker government money bank sec letter government leader everything boat defeat retirement boy year job money system play cozy relationship government media business window presidency trump guy birth certificate college student league university something republican relationship border wall border millions trade russia china trump audacity end question trump bid contract college way tab trump fraud trump conspiracy college trump fraud election fraud labor department job report election media trump control truth everyone trump sleeping trump election one look game goose holder prison prison bundler prison customer money jail secretary state head state department level management prison legacy trump trump everyone dogs hell yes season left right silence public truth
17414,STEVE JOBS’ WIDOW ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR “Revolutionary” HILLARY On Same Day Hillary’s Busted For Faking This…,"You d think she d know a thing or two about email servers and at a minimum, question Hillary s integrity Apple founder Steve Jobs  widow Laurene has told of her admiration for Democratic White House front-runner Hillary Clinton.Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a  revolutionary  woman, and added that it s not just because she s a woman   but  the type of woman she is .Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said:  Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America s greatest modern creations. Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. Oops wrong picture! It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is. Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday   and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet  ordinary  voters in Iowa.But she was blasted for her  staged  visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa.Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated  from beginning to end .Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour.The three got the lion s share of Mrs. Clinton s time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a  roundtable  the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama s 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,  Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn. The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,  Bird recalled,  to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says,  Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her? And then we got in a car   Troy s car   and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us. Bird said  we all were called. I mean, Troy asked us all to do   to go to a meeting with him. And we didn t really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.

18686,NOT KIDDING! High School Assignment: “Prudence is thirty-four. She has had sex with 21 men and 3 women”," Prudence is thirty-four. She has had sex with twenty-one men and three women,  according an assignment for high schoolers in Scotland County, Missouri. After being celibate for three years, she meets Larry and a romance begins to develop. Larry is thirty-seven. One night he proposes that, things going the way he thinks they re going between them, they talk about their sexual histories. A concerned mother recently contacted Fox News columnist Todd Starnes about the assignment after her child received it in an English class at Scotland County R-1 Junior-Senior High School. Larry confesses to having slept with three women, one of whom he married. She tells him that she has slept with three men. Larry is uncomfortable with this number, especially since Prudence is younger than he is,  the assignment continued.  She amends it, saying that one was just heavy petting. Given Prudence s reflexive need for approval and Larry s clear ideas of how things should be, what percentage of the time will Prudence be inhibited in bed with Larry, and consequently fake orgasm to ease his pride? Here is a photo of the assignment: This is something I imagine you would see on a coffee table in every brothel,  the irate mother told Starnes.The unidentified woman said she contacted the school s principal, who provided a lame excuse for the assignment.

3880," On Election Day, Trump Calls Running For President A “Waste Of Time’ (VIDEO)","Whether Republican nominee Donald Trump actually ever wanted to be the next President of the United States has been under speculation for a while now, especially with rumors about a Trump TV network surfacing as his campaign came to an end. It probably doesn t help that Trump celebrated Election Day by dissing his own presidential campaign, perhaps in early acceptance that he might come out of this defeated.In an interview with Fox and Friends on Tuesday morning, Trump decided to spend Election Day telling Americans that his campaign might very well have been a big waste of time for him. His exact words were: If I don t win, I will consider it a waste of time, energy and money. Seriously, could Trump be any less deserving of America s future? His rival, Hillary Clinton, would never have called her campaign a  waste  and understands what an honor it is to lead this country. To imply that he might have better things to do with his time is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of Trump, which is hardly surprising when you look back on how awful his campaign was. You can watch Trump diss his own campaign below:What Trump s family members said on Election Day wasn t much better. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, Donald Trump, Jr. seemed to already be accepting defeat as he spoke about what the Trump family would do after the election. Trump s son said: [If he doesn t win,] we go back largely to doing what we re doing. But I think hopefully he was able to create enough of a movement that forces people in the political elite, people in that political class to truly represent their people. These interviews clearly show that Trump doesn t understand the responsibility or honor that comes with being the commander-in-chief. We ve never had a less worthy presidential candidate, and he doesn t deserve to be elected.Featured image via Andrew Renneisen / Getty Images",News,"November 8, 2016",nominee trump president speculation trump network campaign end help trump election day campaign acceptance interview fox morning trump election day campaign waste time exact win waste time energy money deserving future campaign waste honor country time ignorant trump campaign trump campaign trump family election day morning joe trump defeat trump family election trump son win enough movement people elite people class people trump responsibility honor commander chief candidate deserve image
8331, President Obama Stuns Oil Companies With Crushing Proposal (VIDEO),"President Obama just announced another major shakeup in the last year of his presidency, and the oil companies aren t liking it   that much is for sure. On Thursday, Obama revealed his plan to place a $10 fee on every single barrel of oil produced in the country. Considering the current U.S. crude trading price of $31.72 a gallon, that s a pretty hefty tax.Also   this appears to be a death tax to oil entirely. And, it could make life for the oil companies unbearable. Remember   just one year ago, oil was going for nearly twice as much as what it is now. While in the midterm oil will fluctuate up and down, over time it s trajectory has been going downward. Who knows what the price of oil will be when the tax proposal goes through, if ever?While Republicans still control a majority of Congress and refuse to take up the proposal, Obama s declaration to get rid of oil has already had its impact on the markets. It didn t even take one day and already oil is down 2 percent after the announcement.Keep in mind, Russia and Iran   two major countries that Republicans say are our bitter enemies   well   their entire economies rely heavily on oil. When oil does bad, so do their pockets. Divesting ourselves from oil is a national security concern. If anything, Republicans are hurting our national security from this viewpoint.The idea is not just to penalize oil companies and Republicans (that s wishful thinking) though, the real issue here is thinking about the future of America s energy and what s in the country s best interest. Green energy is; carbon isn t.Here s what Obama plans to do with the money raised from the new tax:-Invest $20 billion to reduce traffic and improve commuting. Think about that   that s more funding than the EPA and Interior Department combined. A lot of this money will go towards alternative transportation options. Think about the Hyperloop being constructed between Los Angeles and San Francisco by billionaire Elon Musk. It s supposed to completely alter our thinking about traveling long distances entirely. And   it s 100% green. That s what this country needs.-Invest $10 billion into state and local transportation and climate programs.-Put $2 billion into research for clean vehicles and aircraft.The White House sees this as the first step in an ambitious new plan for the 21st Century of clean transportation: By placing a fee on oil, the president s plan creates a clear incentive for private-sector innovation to reduce our reliance on oil and at the same time invests in clean energy technologies that will power our future. Former Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania is calling Obama s plan the boldest transportation blueprint since Eisenhower. Considering many think Eisenhower is the last great Republican president to take the oath of office, that s quite the compliment. Since then we ve just been bumping along, doing short-term fixes, and I give them a lot of credit for laying out this kind of long-term investment. I also give them credit for having the guts to say how they would pay for it all. That s very unusual in this area. While it may not pass muster in Congress, that s not what matters here. This proposal is a vision for the future of the country. And, it makes sense. The only thing that s going to get something like this implemented in Congress is voters going to the polls and voting overwhelmingly to fire Republicans on the Hill, as well as seeing to it that a Democrat is sworn in as president. Only then will people be able to follow through on this future vision of change for our country. And, in the meantime, it is kind of fun pissing the oil companies and Republicans off by talking about it.Featured image from Public Domain Files",News,"February 4, 2016",president year presidency oil plan fee barrel oil country crude trading price gallon tax death tax oil life oil year oil oil time trajectory downward price oil tax proposal majority congress refuse proposal declaration oil impact day oil percent announcement mind russia oil oil oil security concern anything security viewpoint idea oil thinking issue future energy country interest energy money tax traffic commuting think department lot money towards transportation billionaire musk country state transportation climate research house step plan century transportation fee oil president plan incentive sector innovation reliance oil time energy power governor plan transportation blueprint president oath office compliment term lot credit kind term investment credit area muster congress proposal vision future country sense thing something congress hill democrat president people vision change country kind fun oil image domain
6156, Two Comedians Imagine The Trump-Bernie Debate And It Is HILARIOUS (VIDEO),"When Donald Trump recently said he would love to have a debate with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during his appearance on  Jimmy Kimmel Live, he probably didn t think it would actually happen   despite the fact that he bragged about how much the debate  would have such high ratings. But it turned out that Sanders was more than happy to fulfill The Donald s request, knowing full well that he could wipe the debate floor with the presumptive Republican nominee on any day of the week and not even break a sweat doing it. In teasing about the debate, Trump challenged Bernie to raise $10 million for charity   a mission that Sanders immediately accepted by responding on Twitter: Game On. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7th primary. So although Trump might have never actually intended on having a face off with the Vermont senator and is likely regretting opening his big mouth (for once), it looks like it might actually happen!We can t wait to see Sanders put Trump in his place, and fortunately we have something to hold us over. We can easily get a preview of what the debate is going to look like thanks to the Trump vs. Bernie Web/TV Series and live tour, which is the genius comedy project of James Adomian (Bernie) and Anthony Atamanuik (Trump).These two comedians have brought Sanders and Trump to life with their spot-on impersonations, perfectly capturing Trump s ability to be offensive and effectively avoid answering direct questions, as well as Sanders  unwavering dedication to human rights movements and the middle class. This skit is absolutely brilliant, and really gives us a taste of what we might actually see before Trump gets his ass handed to him in real life.You can watch the hilarious special below:Let s just hope Trump doesn t  chicken out  of the real debate! Sanders  campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said Bernie is ready to go: We are ready to debate Donald Trump. We hope he will not chicken out. I think it will be great for America to see these two candidates and the different visions they have for America going forward. What we ll have to see, is does Donald Trump have the courage to get on the stage with Bernie Sanders. That remains to be seen.

The protesters who are likely being organized by the Democrat Party and George Soros are hilariously protesting Kid Rock for speaking out against the unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during our national anthem. Some of them are using the excuse that he used a confederate flag as a backdrop to his concerts years ago to protest Rock, who is likely going to challenge the 2-term liberal Democrat US Senator Debbie Stabenow in 2018. Kid Rock is the recipient of the Detroit NAACP Great Expectations award for his exceptional contribution to the black community of Detroit and is the single father of a black son.Here s a look at the small group of protesters whose numbers were estimated from between 50-200.

20704,THIS PICTURE OF HARRIET TUBMAN Should Be Used On The $20 Bill…If For No Other Reason Than To Drive Anti-Gun Left Crazy,"Obama has filled his cabinet with radical  yes  men and women who hold similar anti-American, leftist views. His radical Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew is no exception.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  announced yesterday that Alexander Hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill.What the Left forgot in their haste to replace a  racist  white (Democrat) President on the front of the $20 bill was the fact that Harriet Tubman was more than just a black abolitionist, she also serves as an excellent example of why our Second Amendment is so important.Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820   March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. She carried a revolver, and was not afraid to use it . . .Once a slave agreed to join her expedition, there was no turning back; she threatened to shoot anyone who tried to return. Tubman told the tale of one journey with a group of fugitive slaves, when morale sank and one man insisted he was going to go back to the plantation.She pointed the gun at his head and said,  You go on or die.  Several days later, he was with the group as they entered Canada. It is more than likely that Tubman carried the handgun as protection from ever-present slave catchers and their dogs.Via: The Truth About GunsBreaking: Treasury throws founder of the Democratic Party off $20 bill, replaces with gun-toting Republican pic.twitter.com/G9dVXpTaXv  David Burge (@iowahawkblog) April 20, 2016Tubman s reliance on her firearms to fulfill her mission of freeing slaves was essential.

1680," Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true route of blaming President Obama.Spicer explained that the Trump White House isn t responsible for anything related to Flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the Obama administration  and  those are not documents that the White House would ever possess. Everything that the White House has been asked to do, the only documents that were made available to [Congress] that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had,  Spicer said, explaining that he doesn t feel that the White House has an obligation to provide the information Congress has requested. How about these calls made where [Flynn] was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump?  CBS s Major Garrett asked.  Aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can? It s a question [of] if you can,  Spicer said.  To ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish. Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition were they not?  Garrett asked. Spicer, of course, told him that Trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before January 20 even if it was done by a member of the Trump transition team. When?  Spicer asked.  We started this administration on Jan. 20. All the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House. Working for the transition!  Garrett pressed. Not at the White House!  Spicer snapped.  Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to Jan. 20th. Trump and his White House are absolutely responsible for Flynn   which is not good, as even Hillary Clinton witch hunter, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, admits that Flynn likely committed crimes.Watch this all happen below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2017",house propaganda minister spicer thing house security advisor agent spicer route president spicer house anything administration house everything house department defense feel house obligation information congress transition behalf president trump responsibility obligation question call security adviser behalf trump transition spicer course trump anything member trump transition team spicer administration information house transition house spicer everything trump house witch congressman image
6490, Former GOP Senator BLASTS Trump: ‘I Think He’s A Sociopath’,"The list of establishment Republicans who are refusing to support Donald Trump as the 2016 presidential nominee just keeps on growing. The latest is a former GOP senator from New Hampshire, Gordon Humphrey. Sen. Humphrey says that he will not be getting behind the billionaire for the presidency for one simple reason: he believes the man is a  sociopath.  When asked about supporting Trump during efforts to get the party to unite behind the presumptive nominee, Humphrey said: Unequivocally, I am not supporting Donald Trump. I think he s a sociopath. Now, these are strong words coming from within the GOP, but they are also most likely correct. Humphrey isn t the only one in the anti-Trump camp, either. Paul Ryan has yet to get behind Trump, and he is currently the highest ranking Republican in Congress. Further, GOP consultant Michael Biundo said the following via Twitter: By not supporting Trump, I am supporting our country. These statements are not, of course, stopping Trump s people from trying to get GOPers to get behind the business mogul s plans to become America s facsist dictator president. Trump has a chairman in New Hampshire, Steve Stepanek, who is urging people to get behind his man. He says: I am focused on bringing the party together. I m not going to be asking for any Republican s resignation at this point in time. I m asking Republicans to unite behind Donald Trump and the entire Republican ticket here in the state of New Hampshire. The thing is, though, Trump is the most divisive force that the GOP has seen in many years, possibly ever. He is the same for the country. His violent rhetoric, unhinged supporters, and irrational, mean-spirited behavior have made all sane people run as far away from this goon as possible, regardless of political persuasion. It doesn t matter at this point who you are   if you have one iota of decency or sense, you don t go anywhere near Donald Trump, and you work to stop his takeover of this great nation, no matter what it takes.Good going, Donald. You are literally destroying the Republican Party before our very eyes.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2016",list trump nominee senator billionaire presidency reason man trump party nominee trump one trump camp trump republican congress consultant twitter trump country course people business dictator president trump chairman people man party resignation point time trump republican ticket state thing trump force country rhetoric mean behavior people goon regardless persuasion matter point iota decency sense trump nation matter party image chip
22509,PROPAGANDA: Star Trek Beyond – Social Justice Warriors in Space,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe last Star Trek reboot saw Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn, the berserk super soldier who was angry about the  Federation  doing some such nefarious thing to his people group.  This installment  included curious references to false flags which I detailed here.Before that, in the initial reboot, there was an angry alien who attacked the Federation over his tribal group being shat upon (or, Shatnered upon!).  So, for the third time in a row, we have roughly the same plot of dispossessed discontent tribalists and unique people groups who become terrorists when their way of life is encroached upon by the United Nations, er, NATO, er, New World Order, er Federation.We have seen this pattern often in the Star Trek, but in the recent installment, it s even more pronounced as we discover the character Sulu is gay.  Indeed, trans-specism and the destruction of people groups under liberal tyranny has always been the worldview of Star Trek   Gene Roddenberry was a rabidly atheistic globalist (or, as an even darker possibility, was Roddenberry a member of an occultic group known as  The Nine, ?).There is some interesting evidence connecting Roddenberry (connected to the Esalen Institute  which I covered here) to esoteric groups, mind control and the Rand Corporation.  This would explain the many gnostic, scientistic, platonic and at times interestingly philosophical episodes, in the original series and its Next Generation successor.Secret Sun blog explains: So if you were hawking a sci-fi religion, who better to approach than the creator of the sci-fi sensation of the early/mid 70s? From 2008:In early 1975, a broke and depressed Roddenberry was approached by a British former race car driver named Sir John Whitmore, who was associated with a strange organization called  Lab-9.  Though unknown to the public, Lab-9 were ostensibly a sort of an independent version of the X-Files, dedicated to the research of paranormal phenomena. However, Lab-9 had another, more complex agenda- they later claimed to be in contact with a group of extraterrestrials called the  Council of Nine Lab-9 had wanted to hire Roddenberry to write a screenplay based on the Council of Nine s imminent return .Lab-9 flew him out to their headquarters, located on a large estate in Ossining, NY. There, Roddenberry met and interviewed several psychics, and prepared the groundwork for his script.Roddenberry wrote a script called The Nine, in which he fictionalized his experiences at Lab-9 and the message for humanity that the Council of Nine wished to convey Beam me up, RAND!(T)his was no ragtag bunch of hippie phreaks that Roddenberry was dealing with Roddenberry biographer Joel Engel noted that Whitmore introduced Roddenberry to several key figures in the British Broadcasting Corp. as well.  In regard to the connection to RAND, Opsecnews states:According to the TrekPlace website Harvey P. Lynn, Jr. (?-1987), a member of the prestigious RAND Corporation, provided Star Trek original series creator Gene Roddenberry with scientific and technical advice during preproduction of the series.On the Rand Corporation s website the question is asked whether a RAND researcher designed the initial bridge of the Enterprise. The answer given is,  A Rand researcher, Harvey Lynn, was consulted, but as a private citizen, not as part of a RAND project. However in an interview from 1965 Jeffrey Hunter, who played captain Christopher Pike in the Star Trek pilot  The Cage  and preceded William Shatner as first captain of the Enterprise stated,  The things that intrigues me the most is that it is actually based on the Rand Corporation s projection of things to come. Except for the fictional characters, it will be like getting a look into the future and some of the predictions will surely come true in our lifetime. The inherent contradiction that Star Trek continually demonstrates is the contradiction of the liberal philosophy   and I mean in this in the classically liberal sense, that radical egalitarianism and atomistic individualism creates a horrid collective gathered around nothing more than liberalism itself.  In this way, liberalism and its epistemic and cultural relativism can only allow for itself, and must destroy and exclude all other options, including even non-liberal democracy.In numerous Star Trek episodes, we even see the  Prime Directive  of the Federation s commitment to not violating an existing culture violated under the pretended facade of liberal  rights  and values.   Western NGOs and foundations fulfill this very role today, with a cover of aiding the downtrodden, while secretly working for western political ends, as we see in the Soros-funded  White Helmets scam. (If anyone doubts RAND connections to Hollywood, let s not forget the 2014 faux scandal of The Interview). Ironically, the new film demonstrates this toxic cultural imperialism explicitly.  GlobalResearch explains: Aside from not addressing the darker side of US foreign policy, Hollywood movies like Forrest Gump carry subliminal messages. In the words of the US culture and entertainment magazine Rolling Stone:  The message of Forrest Gump was that if you think about the hard stuff too much, you ll either get AIDS or lose your legs. Meanwhile, the hero is the idiot who just shrugs and says  Whatever! whenever his country asks him to do something crazy.  What Rolling Stone is saying that listen to what you are commanded to do.Then there are movies like American Sniper that collapse US foreign policy into the simplistic notion of individual characters. What this does is collapse the event and the soldiers into one, which means that if ones criticize a US war that you are attacking the soldiers and their convictions. This is hiding behind the soldiers and detracting from the real issue of an illegal invasion and occupation. Nor is there any mention of Abu Ghraib or the false weapons of mass destruction lies. Rolling Stone had this to say about American Sniper:  Sniper is a movie whose politics are so ludicrous and idiotic that under normal circumstances it would be beneath criticism. The only thing that forces us to take it seriously is the extraordinary fact that an almost exactly similar worldview consumed the walnut-sized mind of the president who got us into the war in question. It s the fact that the movie is popular, and actually makes sense to so many people, that s the problem,  it also adds. In fact, as a result of the movie there was an increase in hate crimes in the US and negative feelings towards Arabs and Muslims. I was tempted to draw up an elaborate analysis of symbols and deeper meanings, but depth was absent in this film.  Other than an odd similarity between the  terrorist  character as a former soldier who went mad from radicalism (traditionalism!) being similar to the D.C.  sniper  event, Admiral Krall is merely a representation of any cultures or people groups who want a more traditional, organic existence and reject the Federation s globalism.  As such, they are  terrorists  who are impelled by their fury and insanity to bomb the glorious, multi-cultural megalopolis space city Yorktown.  In other words, all groups that aren t on board with globalism and liberal, inverted monoculture are terrists destined to attack New York.Krall thus represents the life-extension inherent in the damned traditionalism that will not die in the face of globalism.  Krall is a grotesque icon of the film s view of patriarchal, honor-based societies as a perpetual reptilian madness that humans must evolve beyond.  If you don t accept homo-mono-globo-liberalism, you are a terrorist that will unleash bioweapons in New York.The Holy United Nations and the space brothers have told the Pentagon humanity must evolve beyond distinctions and borders, and Gene and the pope are is its prophets. By the way   if the citizens of the multi cultural Yorktown space station can beam about at will, why didn t they just beam Admiral Krall into space when he had the bio weapon?Oops! #StarCuck #captainJamesTKuckREAD MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

8474, SNL’s Rachel Dratch Exposes The Terrifying Lunacy Of Open Carry Laws In Less Than 2 Minutes (VIDEO),"Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America recently released their newest gun control PSA, and this one stars Saturday Night Live s Rachel Dratch. The commercial, which is less than two minutes long, starts out fine but takes a dark and terrifying turn at the end. The PSA is a satirical version of the life of a busy mom.The PSA is a satirical version of the life of a busy mom. It starts out with Dratch holding a laundry basket on the stairs in  her  house, saying: I woke up at 6:30 to walk the dog and pack a lunch for fourth grader with a peanut allergy and a seven-year-old who thinks bananas taste like butts! You then see her character s daughter walking past her with a pair of scissors in her hand. Rachel grabs the scissors to protect the little girl from getting hurt while continuing to talk about how busy she is. Her son rides by her on a scooter with no helmet on, so she doesn t miss a beat and puts one on his noggin.Basically, the first half of the commercial is a busy mom, protecting her children as best she can from being hurt in some sort of childhood related accident. At the end of the clip the family is at their favorite restaurant and suddenly the mood changes:The restaurant is filled with people drinking and they all have guns. The PSA is obviously targeting states like Texas where it is now legal for ammosexuals to bring their guns into eateries and scare the crap out of our children. What s worse is that this scenario is completely within the realm of possibility in states like Texas. According to Eater.com:Even though the open-carrying of weapons is still not allowed in bars and other establishments that make 51 percent of their revenue from alcohol sales, restaurants on the opposite side of the equation are left with a difficult question to answer.So if your local family restaurant makes less than 51 percent of its money on alcohol sales, crazy Bob from down the road can bring his weapon with him, get drunk and accidentally kill your kid with his penile extension.

409, Trump Official Gets Asked A Simple Question About Global Warming. Her Response Is Unbelievable. (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s administration finds new ways to look foolish on a daily basis, and Trump s staff is more than willing to pick up the slack whenever their boss isn t behaving like a big enough idiot.On Friday, Trump s acting assistant administrator for Asia, Gloria Steele, made sure that she humiliated America and the Trump administration when she was left uncomfortably speechless by a simple question about climate change. The question was asked by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who wanted to know if climate change has  anything at all to do with  rising sea levels in reference to the massive flooding in Bangladesh. Connolly asked Steele: Could the fact that a third of an entire sovereign nation Bangladesh being under water, could it have anything at all to do with, I don t know, the warming of the climate? Just like most of the incompetent people staffed on Trump s administration, Steele doesn t know a damn thing about the position she s in. Steele was obviously unprepared to answer any real questions about the matter, because all she could do was smile and let her mouth hang open as she was left clueless and speechless. This is an absolutely inappropriate response to a simple, straightforward question, but Steele could do no better.It turns out that Steele is taking after her boss in being completely ignorant. Trump himself has called climate change a  hoax  many times, and has even blamed the Chinese for being responsible for its creation. Trump s denial of facts and evidence on climate change is so dangerous that he made the United States one of the only three countries to oppose the Paris Climate Agreement. The stupidity of Trump and his administration are major threats to the future of the climate, and it s clear that they don t have any of the answers that the planet needs.

2553, Even Donald Trump’s Inauguration Poster Has A GLARING Misspelling (IMAGE),"I can only imagine that the stack of resumes on Donald Trump s desk is full of spelling errors, which to the most anti-intellectual administration in recent American history, is certainly not a disqualifier, at least if we judge by the communications coming from the White House over the last three weeks.The horrendous spelling came early. During the campaign, Trump regularly misspelled words on his tweets. That hasn t changed. Shortly before Trump s inauguration, he tweeted about China, and managed to misspell the word  unprecedented.  He eventually fixed it, but it took nearly an hour and a half.More recently, though, Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos tweeted about W.E.B. Du Bois, but instead of spelling it the way the Civil Rights Leader and founder of the NAACP did, her tweet, which happened to fall during Black History Month, spelled his name DeBois.The department fairly quickly apologized, but not without misspelling  apologies.  Yes, that came from the department in charge of educating our children.In another embarrassing misspelling, this one a bit more tactile than a tweet, Trump s inaugural poster also has a misspelling:President Trump s official inauguration portrait offered by the Library of Congress had a glaring typo on it, social media users pointed out Sunday evening.The print of Trump, which was sold on the Library of Congress s website, includes a quote from the president   but misspells  too  as  to. No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,  the quote reads on the poster.Source: The HillThe poster has been taken off the website, but not before some screenshots were taken.Is this a big deal in the overall scheme of things? Not really, but it does show a frightening trend within the Trump administration: no dedication to detail in a job where every single word matters. For example, it s been widely reported that Trump doesn t even read the executive orders he s pushing out on nearly a daily basis. He even signed away much of his power to the neo-nazi Steve Bannon.For the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Source: GQIf that sort of sloppiness, from the office of arguably the most powerful man in the world, doesn t terrify you, then nothing will.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"February 12, 2017",stack trump desk administration history house spelling campaign trump inauguration china word hour half trump education secretary way leader founder tweet history month name department department charge misspelling bit trump poster misspelling president trump inauguration portrait library congress typo media print trump library congress quote president dream challenge nothing future reach quote poster source poster deal scheme trend administration dedication job word example trump basis power moment president adviser trump anger executive order strategist seat security council source frustration president travel ban source sort sloppiness office man world nothing image

12840,CHAMPION OF WOMEN? How Hillary Used Private Investigators To Destroy Women Her Political Prize Husband Was Sleeping With: “We have to destroy her story”,"Hillary won t be able to claim a vast right-wing conspiracy when she sees the article the left-leaning New York Times published. The article outlines how Hillary aggressively pursued the women her husband willingly chose to have sex with while he was married to her. Hillary never considered the women her philandering husband had sexual relations with were merely victims of a serial sexual abuser. He was her ticket to the ultimate power. The truth of the matter is, Hillary destroyed these women and protected her sexual predator husband, because having the ultimate political power was more important to her than the victims her husband discarded like yesterday s trash. This is the woman who is to be held up as an example for our daughters? This is the woman who young girls on college campuses say they ll vote for because she has matching genitalia? Hillary s true story needs to be told. She is nothing more than a two-bit opportunist who has clung to a charismatic serial sexual abuser of women for one reason, and one reason only to get to this point her ultimate goal the first serious female candidate for President of the United States. As usual with the Clinton s anyone who is harmed on their way up the political ladder, is of little or no consequence to them Last week, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, criticized Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Clinton s affairs and her response to them, and said he might talk more about the issue in the final weeks before the election.That could be a treacherous strategy for Mr. Trump, given his own past infidelity and questionable treatment of women. Many voters, particularly women, might see Mrs. Clinton being blamed for her husband s conduct.It could also remind voters of a searing period in American history, and in Mrs. Clinton s life.Confronting a spouse s unfaithfulness is painful under any circumstance. For Mrs. Clinton, it happened repeatedly and in the most public of ways, unfolding at the dawn of the 24/7 news cycle, and later in impeachment proceedings that convulsed the nation.Outwardly, she remained stoic and defiant, defending her husband while a progression of women and well-funded conservative operatives accused Mr. Clinton of behavior unbecoming the leader of the free world.But privately, she embraced the Clinton campaign s aggressive strategy of counterattack: Women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Mr. Clinton would become targets of digging and discrediting   tactics that women s rights advocates frequently denounce.The campaign hired a private investigator with a bare-knuckles reputation who embarked on a mission, as he put it in a memo, to impugn Ms. Flowers s  character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition. In a pattern that would later be repeated with other women, the investigator s staff scoured Arkansas and beyond, collecting disparaging accounts from ex-boyfriends, employers and others who claimed to know Ms. Flowers, accounts that the campaign then disseminated to the news media.By the time Mr. Clinton finally admitted to  sexual relations  with Ms. Flowers, years later, Clinton aides had used stories collected by the private investigator to brand her as a  bimbo  and a  pathological liar. Mrs. Clinton s level of involvement in that effort, as described in interviews, internal campaign records and archives, is still the subject of debate. By some accounts, she gave the green light and was a motivating force; by others, her support was no more than tacit assent.What is clear is that Mrs. Clinton was in a difficult spot. She was aware that her husband had cheated earlier in their marriage, but by her telling, she also believed him when he denied the accusations levied by Ms. Flowers and others.Mickey Kantor, the chairman of Bill Clinton s 1992 campaign, said that Mrs. Clinton wanted to separate fact from fiction and to size up the women making the claims. Let s say the woman has some not-helpful things that she has done in the past,  Mr. Kantor said.  Wouldn t you want to know that, and evaluate it? Mrs. Clinton and her husband declined to be interviewed, and her campaign did not answer questions about her support of efforts to undermine the women.  The country closed the book on these matters close to 20 years ago, and there is nothing whatsoever new here,  her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement.Her campaign also released statements from James Carville, Mr. Clinton s top campaign strategist, and two lawyers who worked for Mr. Clinton, saying that Mrs. Clinton had not overseen the counterattacks. Those who took the lead in responding to those attacks at the time have plainly stated that Hillary Clinton did not direct their work,  Mr. Fallon said.Neutralizing the WhispersFour years after Gary Hart fled a presidential race amid speculation about an affair, every accusation of womanizing was viewed as a mortal threat to Mr. Clinton s campaign.Stanley Greenberg, a pollster for the campaign who had strategized with the Clintons in the fall of 1991 about how to handle the rumors of infidelity, recalled Mrs. Clinton s acknowledgment that her husband had strayed. It was an uncomfortable meeting,  Mr. Greenberg said in an interview for an oral history of Mr. Clinton s presidency conducted by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.  I remember Hillary saying that,  obviously, if I could say no to this question, we would say no, and therefore, there is an issue. Weeks later, their first taste of trouble came in a Penthouse magazine story by a rock groupie named Connie Hamzy, who claimed Mr. Clinton had once propositioned her at a hotel in Little Rock, Ark.Mr. Clinton brushed off the story, saying that Ms. Hamzy had made a sexual advance toward him, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director of the 1992 campaign, recalled in his book,  All Too Human. But Mrs. Clinton demanded action. We have to destroy her story,  she said, according to Mr. Stephanopoulos.In what became a common tactic, affidavits were collected, from an aide and two others who stated that they were with Mr. Clinton at the hotel and that Ms. Hamzy s story was false. (Contacted recently, Ms. Hamzy said she stood by her account.)When the work was done, both Clintons called Mr. Stephanopoulos, together, to offer their thanks.An Explosive AccusationThe Gennifer Flowers story landed like a bomb weeks before the New Hampshire primary.Ms. Flowers, a lounge singer and Arkansas state employee at the time, sold Star magazine her story claiming an affair with Mr. Clinton that had lasted more than 10 years.In a meeting with aides, the Clintons scripted a unified defense that they delivered in the interview on  60 Minutes. With Mrs. Clinton nodding agreement, Mr. Clinton admitted to the TV audience to  causing pain in my marriage,  but denied an affair with Ms. Flowers. Mrs. Clinton professed sympathy for Ms. Flowers, saying she had been caught up in rumors through no fault of her own.But at a news conference the next day, Ms. Flowers reasserted her claims, playing excerpts from her calls with Mr. Clinton. The two could be heard discussing the attention the rumors were getting, and she joked about his sexual talents.Glimpsing the news conference in South Dakota, Mrs. Clinton directed an aide to get Mr. Clinton on the phone, Gail Sheehy, a journalist traveling with her, recalled in a recent interview. It was a reaction of no surprise, but immediate anger and action,  said Ms. Sheehy, who also described her observations in a Vanity Fair article that year.  Not anger at Bill, but at Flowers, the press and Republicans. Back on a plane that night, Mrs. Clinton told Ms. Sheehy that if she were to question Ms. Flowers in front of a jury,  I would crucify her. Weeks later, a small group of campaign aides, along with Mrs. Clinton, met at the governor s mansion in Little Rock, and they made a pivotal decision: They would hire Jack Palladino, a private investigator known for tactics such as making surreptitious recordings and deploying attractive women to extract information.An aide to the campaign, who declined to be publicly identified because the aide had not been authorized to speak for the Clintons, said Mrs. Clinton was among those who had discussed and approved the hiring, which shifted the campaign to a more aggressive posture.Mr. Kantor, the campaign chairman, said he did not know whether Mrs. Clinton had specifically approved Mr. Palladino s employment as the other aide recalled. But he said that she had seen a need for outside help. She believed we had to deal with the issue directly,  Mr. Kantor said.Mr. Palladino, who did not respond to requests for an interview, reported to James Lyons, a lawyer working for the campaign. In a memo that he addressed to Mr. Lyons on March 30, Mr. Palladino proposed a full-court press on Ms. Flowers. Every acquaintance, employer, and past lover should be located and interviewed,  Mr. Palladino wrote.  She is now a shining icon   telling lies that so far have proved all benefit and no cost   for any other opportunist who may be considering making Clinton a target. Soon, Ms. Flowers heard from ex-boyfriends and others who said they had been contacted by a private investigator. They would say that he would try to manipulate them,  Ms. Flowers recalled,  or get them to say things like I was sexually active. Karen Steele, who had worked with Ms. Flowers at the Roy Clark Celebrity Theater in Branson, Mo., was among those who received a visit.  I remember I got questioned about brothers Gennifer and I once dated,  she said.  It wasn t warm and fuzzy. While Mrs. Clinton considered the Lewinsky affair a  personal lapse  by her husband, she gave him credit for trying to break it off and manage someone who was a  narcissistic loony toon,  according to Ms. Blair s papers.Bill Clinton can be seen lying before Grand Jury about sexual relations he had with Monica Lewinsky, a young intern in the Oval Office, for which he was impeached later. Hillary s close friend Diane Blair   a political science professor whose papers were donated to the University of Arkansas Special Collections library   Hillary Clinton credited Bill Clinton with trying to break away from Lewinsky, whom she called a  narcissistic loony toon. :Soon after, Mrs. Clinton expressed pleasure to her friend that she and her husband were able to drive  their adversaries totally nuts  because they did not appear to be suffering.For entire story: New York Times ",politics,"Oct 4, 2016",conspiracy article left york times article husband sex husband abuser ticket power truth matter predator husband power husband yesterday trash woman example woman college vote genitalia story needs nothing bit opportunist abuser reason reason point goal female candidate president anyone way ladder consequence week nominee response issue election strategy trump past infidelity treatment husband conduct period history life spouse unfaithfulness circumstance ways dawn news cycle nation husband progression behavior leader world campaign strategy counterattack digging tactics campaign investigator bare reputation mission memo character veracity recognition pattern investigator staff campaign news media time investigator brand liar level involvement effort campaign subject debate light force support assent spot husband marriage telling chairman bill campaign fact fiction size woman husband campaign support country book nothing spokesman statement campaign campaign strategist lead time work hart race speculation affair accusation threat campaign pollster campaign fall infidelity husband meeting interview history presidency miller center university question issue taste trouble penthouse magazine story rock hotel rock ark story advance director campaign book action story aide hotel story account work thanks story bomb lounge singer state employee time magazine story affair meeting defense interview agreement audience pain marriage affair sympathy fault news conference day attention news conference aide phone journalist interview reaction surprise anger action vanity article year bill press plane night front jury group campaign governor mansion rock decision jack investigator tactics information aide campaign aide campaign posture campaign chairman employment aide need help issue interview lawyer campaign memo march court press acquaintance employer lover icon benefit cost opportunist target investigator clark celebrity theater mo visit affair lapse husband credit someone loony toon blair bill jury intern office blair science professor university bill loony toon pleasure friend husband story york times
5139, #NeverTrump GOP Intelligence Expert Launching Independent Bid To Stop Trump,"The #NeverTrump faction of the GOP has longed for an Independent conservative to run for the presidency in a last ditch effort to make sure that Donald Trump s nightmare of a presidential campaign does not become a nightmarish reality in the event he gets elected to a job he is dangerously unqualified to perform. Well, they are getting their wish.Evan McMullin is a longtime conservative. He is also firmly #NeverTrump. Like Trump, the man has never been elected to any public office whatsoever; however, he is also a seasoned member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). McMullin currently serves as Chief Policy Director of the House Republican conference, and is certainly much more qualified to do the job of president than Trump could ever dream of being. To that end, sources say that McMullin is going to enter the presidential race with one goal in mind: stopping Donald Trump.According to Buzzfeed, this could turn out to be a very serious bid, as top GOP operatives who refuse to back Trump and openly criticize him, such as Rick Wilson, would firmly back McMullin s attempts to derail Trump s path to the White House. McMullin might have a tough run, though, because he is pretty much invisible to be such an important inside player in GOP politics. His Twitter account has very few followers compared to most politicians and other public figures, and he also has no verification. However, that has not stopped him from sharply slamming Trump to what following he does have. Here is one such tweet:Authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump use promises of law & order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) July 22, 2016Also, regarding Trump s increasingly divisive and bigoted statements against Muslims, McMullin posted to his Facebook what all sane, educated people already know: Trump s rhetoric makes us less safe, not more safe with regards to radicalized terrorists: As Donald Trump continues attacking Muslims and as a former CIA officer, I d like all Americans to know the truth: American and other Muslims have played a central role in virtually every counterterrorism win we ve had since 9/11. They are an indispensable asset in this fight. Attacking them as a group makes America weaker, not stronger. While McMullin s battle will be uphill, there are growing mutterings that he would have serious support. However, at this point, he will likely not be able to be on the ballot in all 50 states at this late date, and he will likely face campaigning and money issues. Also, we all know the fate of third party bids at the national level.Now, make no mistake, liberals: This guy is not our dream come true. He is a true blue right winger who would still usher in social policies that would prove nightmarish for many groups, including women and LGBTQ people. He is a Mormon, and, like Mitt Romney, has strong support in Utah, where Trump is heartily disliked. Our best hope is that McMullin splits the GOP even further than Trump has, thus handing the election to Democrats.The only other option would be for the GOP to dump Trump in favor of McMullin, which seems highly unlikely at this time.Featured image via Evan McMullin Twitter",News,"August 8, 2016",faction presidency ditch effort trump nightmare campaign reality event job trump man office member intelligence agency chief policy director house conference job president trump end race goal mind trump bid trump trump path house run inside player politics twitter account verification trump tweet use law order control force trump sane people rhetoric trump officer truth role asset fight group battle support point ballot date money fate party level mistake guy dream blue winger people mormon mitt support trump hope trump election option trump favor time image twitter
5200," GOP Billionaire Meg Whitman Endorses Hillary Clinton, Trashes Trump","Another day, another billionaire and/or Republican refuses to endorse the train wreck that is Donald J. Trump. While a slew of influential Republicans   elected or not   have rescinded or flat out refused to endorse the GOP presidential nominee, others have stubbornly remained by his side even after being stabbed in the back.But as Trump continues to say any outrageous, offensive and grotesque thing that comes to mind, one influential mega donor in the party is saying  enough  and is endorsing Trump s rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton instead. And her endorsement of Clinton isn t a  I guess I m with her  mentality, either   it s a full blown  Ready for Hillary  sentiment.Meg Whitman, a self made billionaire who didn t have any help from her daddy, posted a stinging denouncement of Trump on her Facebook. Earlier this year, during the primary, Whitman expressed concern that Trump s rhetoric would hurt the party and turn off the electorate.  It turns out she was right, as Hillary Clinton has taken the lead (for now) by margins of 7 points to 15 points nationally.Whitman referred to Trump as  uninformed,   unsteady,   authoritarian,  and a  demogauge.  She also praised Clinton for being an experienced, level-headed leader:As a proud Republican, casting my vote for President has usually been a simple matter. This year is different. To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division. Donald Trump s demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character.Trump s reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues   from immigration to our economy to foreign policy   have made it abun dantly clear that he lacks both the policy depth and sound judgment required as President. Trump s unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.Therefore, I have decided to support Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is clear to me that Secretary Clinton s temperament, global experience and commitment to America s bedrock national values make her the far better choice in 2016 for President of the United States. In a tumultuous world, America needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership Secretary Clinton can provide. I urge all Republicans to reject Donald Trump this November.Whitman, who is seen as a more moderate Republican given her positions of abortion, gay marriage and immigration, did the unthinkable: she put country over party. And for that Republicans are already denouncing her like they did Romney, Kasich, Christie Todd Whitman, and so forth.This also shouldn t come as a huge surprise. Whitman has donated to and aligned herself with California senator Barbara Boxer, considered one of the most liberal members of the Senate.Good for Meg Whitman in denouncing Trump and doing what is right. Hopefully more Republicans will take action.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"August 3, 2016",day billionaire train wreck trump slew nominee side trump thing donor party nominee endorsement guess mentality blown ready sentiment self billionaire help daddy denouncement trump year concern trump rhetoric party electorate lead level leader casting vote president matter year party loyalty candidacy anger grievance xenophobia division trump demagoguery fabric character trump reckless immigration economy policy policy depth judgment president trump hand prosperity security character therefore rodham secretary temperament experience commitment bedrock choice president world kind leadership secretary trump abortion gay marriage immigration country party surprise senator boxer senate good trump action image burton
18046,LOL! CROOKED and IRRELEVANT HILLARY CLINTON GOES ON TOUR…Wait Till You See What She’s Asking Fans To Pay For Tickets,"Hillary Clinton will be back in the spotlight this fall for an unprecedented, big-ticket book tour for her new tome What Happened, with tickets priced as high as $1,200.On Monday, the ex-Democratic nominee announced  Hillary Clinton Live,  a 15-city tour, which includes stops in a handful of states she lost in the election last year.The astronomically priced tickets for Hillary s loser tour, certainly begs the question:  If no one came to see Hillary at her rallies (for free) when she was running for president, why would they pay $1,200 to hear the even more irrelevant Hillary Clinton whine about why she lost to Trump? Promotional materials for her first stop, at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., promises Clinton plans to  let loose  and tell her audience a  personal, raw, detailed and surprisingly funny story  of her election loss and recovery.The website promoting the tour, HillaryClintonBookTour.com, features a quote from Clinton too. In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net,  she said.  Now I m letting my guard down,  she pledged. The tour kicks off on September 18 in D.C. and continues on all through fall.Clinton is making stops in the trio of states that are largely blamed for her election loss: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Clinton is hitting up a trio of Canadian cities too, making appearances in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Top-tier ticket packages in those cities cost $3,000 Canadian dollars for two seats, or, in American dollars, about $1,200 a pop.

714, White Man Murders Cop And Racist Media Stays Silent,"Jason Brown, despite the  colorful  appellation, is about the whitest name I ve heard all day. Except I didn t hear it today. Not in the news anyway. Not on that little  trending  bar on the side of my Facebook feed, or with a hashtag in front of it on Twitter. Which is weird, because a dude named Jason Brown murdered a police officer in Indianapolis on Thursday.I can t help but think if his skin matched his name, you d already know who I was talking about. In fact, if Jason Brown looked a little more like Michael Brown, you might already know he had previous drug charges. You might even have seen this picture of him by now:Image via TwitterI know you haven t seen that picture until now, though. In fact, I know unless you clicked the link above, you still think I m just making some point about how white people can get away with all kinds of stuff people of color in America can t. I m not, of course. I m just here to provide some contrast for the very limited, very, very sanitized coverage available so far about Jason Brown, from the south side of Indianapolis, Indiana.All that is according to literally everyone the news has bothered to contact so far about this guy who murdered a cop. Perhaps if there was some footage of him selling loose cigarettes.You see, when Jason Brown got in a terrible car accident and officers responded to the scene, they expected to find someone in need of assistance. The slain policeman, Lieutenant Aaron Allan, certainly didn t expect to be met by a driver hanging upside-down in the demolished car, ready to fire multiple shots into his torso.Lt. Allan died later Thursday.So where is the wall-to-wall coverage of this cop murderer? It must be hiding behind this family-provided picture that the news is running with:All I can say is, I ve been working on this article for a while now, and I just came across the very first link that provided any insight as to why he might have completely broken character and started shooting at the officer. An Indy NBC affiliate says the police recovered 13 small bags of weed   which of course is possession with intent to deliver. Prison time.I wonder if, when they finally do charge Brown with the officer s murder (since they still haven t), they ll tack on those drug charges too, like they would if he was actually, um  Brown?Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"July 29, 2017",appellation name day today news bar side feed front twitter dude brown police officer help skin name fact brown drug picture image picture fact link point people people color course contrast coverage brown side everyone news guy cop footage brown car accident scene someone need assistance slain policeman allan driver car torso allan wall coverage cop murderer family picture news article link character officer indy affiliate police weed course intent prison time officer murder tack drug brown image joe

So you have an Islamic terrorist who even in 2001 as a teenager was cheering the 9/11 attack. He cased different targets, including Disney World (happy, but not a  gay  target) and prepared for the attack apparently for quite some time. He listened to Anwar al Awlaki videos, and has connection to radicals like American suicide Moner Abu Salha. He makes comments to coworkers about his connections to terrorists that spark them to call the FBI. During the attack, he calls media, says he s doing it because of ISIS, tells the victims that s why he s doing it, tells the police that s why he s doing it. He also tells victims he s doing it because the  US bombing of my country'[Afghanistan, he was born in NY but apparently self-identified as Afghan]. ISIS claims the attack and calls him a  soldier of the caliphate .The police never say it s Islamic terrorism, and they immediately said the morning after,  there are leanings in that direction . They have reported the connections to radicals and are still looking at all the connections now.But it s  domestic gun violence  to these people?Check out the poll below:Why?

20775,GAP APOLOGIZES For “Offensive Image” After Blacktivists Use Social Media To Attack Ad…But Here’s DIRTY SECRET Race Agitators Aren’t Sharing,"This social media campaign against the GAP is a great example of how the Black Lives agitators are using resources like Twitter to intimidate and threaten individuals, colleges and even large corporations like GAP. You can t blame these blacktivists for using  white guilt  as a weapon to game the system, as a means to gain an advantage over everyone else (Hispanics and Asians included). The real question is, when is someone going to be brave enough to stand up and say  enough of this manufactured hate! The ad for Gap s latest collaboration with Ellen DeGeneres is awash with pleasing blue hues, from the kid models  navy outfits to the talk show host s denim jacket.But the shades that really caught people s attention were on the children s skin. The commercial s stars were three white girls and a black girl.https://youtu.be/gdxXBqdfWMEThat, in itself, wasn t a problem. In the days following the campaign s launch last week, what drew ire from commentators online was the seeming passivity of the African American girl. While the other girls eagerly fielded DeGeneres s questions about their troupe  Le Petite Cirque,  she sat silent. While the white girls were highlighted performing solo acrobatic tricks, she seemed to appear only in reference to the others   balancing on someone s knees or with her arm wrapped around someone s waist.At least, this was the interpretation of those who were angered by the ad. And they were angered, most of all, by a photograph that showed the white girls standing in all manner of complex poses while the black girl s arms dangled idly at her sides, her head a cushion upon which another white girl rested an elbow.This imagery sparked the usual chain of reactions online. Those who were offended minced no words in expressing their outrage, and they were promptly reprimanded by those who thought they were overreacting.So @Gap decides to use the only Black girl in this campaign as a prop ..we see you! pic.twitter.com/widB8Axk5U    ArtsySneakerGirl (@BamaIntrovert) April 3, 2016That ad certainly isn't suggesting that *black* girls ""can do anything,"" @GapKids. It's incredibly distasteful to your black consumer base.  stacia l. brown (@slb79) April 3, 2016Many critics zeroed in on the caption Gap had used to introduce the campaign:  Meet the kids who are proving that girls can do anything. The Root s Kirsten West Savali articulated the essence of the distress:  While all of the girls are adorable, and indeed, all of them should grow up to be and do anything, it becomes problematic when the black child is positioned to be a white child s prop. What race agitators at  The Root  neglected to mention is that the white girl and the black girl whose head her arm resting upon are actually SISTERS! @TheRoot girl with arm resting on her shoulder is her sister She didn't talk in video because she was 2 shy. everyone needs to calm down.  Brooke Smith (@Iam_BrookeSmith) April 3, 2016They also neglected to post the photo from the GAP s ad campaign from last year:The company apologized Tuesday. As a brand with a proud 46 year history of championing diversity and inclusivity, we appreciate the conversation that has taken place and are sorry to anyone we ve offended,  Gap spokeswoman Debbie Felix said in a statement to Fortune.The offensive image will be removed, but the campaign will move forward, the company said.

8083, Bill Clinton Hilariously Smacks Down Obnoxious Trump Supporter As Only He Can (VIDEO),"While at a campaign event in Riviera Beach Florida, Bill Clinton was speaking about his wife, Hillary, and letting everyone know why they should choose her in the upcoming election. However, from the crowd came shouts of protest from a lone Donald Trump supporter who stood with a Trump campaign sign smirking and looking very proud of himself.What this protester didn t realize was coming was the fact that the former president is used to being attacked from every angle. He will have a comeback and retort to everything thrown his way. So that protester soon had his condescending smirk wiped off his face by an epic verbal smack down that he likely was not expecting.The Trump supporter was shouting You took his money!  in reference to the Clinton s taking Trump s money for their foundation. This is when Clinton responded without even blinking an eye: I certainly did. I took his money for my foundation and used it better than he s using it now. However, the Trump minion still stood there with his smug little smile waving his sign around for all to see. And as the crowd grew restless at this obnoxious display, Clinton took on this creep head on. Referencing Trump, he said: I remember when he called me to say how terrible the Republicans had been to Hillary and me and how unfair they were and what a brilliant job Hillary did as a senator. By the way, a lot of them called me about that, which is why they spent the last three years trying to tear her down because they know if they nominate her they are going to have to eat the words they said. However, the former president wasn t done. As the Secret Service finally led the Trump lackey away, Clinton said: If you want to build a wall along the Rio Grande and spend $13 million, then you should follow him like Moses into the Promised Land. BURRRNNN! Clinton basically told the guy that Trump is full of crap and is selling him on racist promises he simply won t be able to deliver.The lesson to be learned from all of this?

17829,WOW! HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS BLASTS Ben Affleck…Posts Video Showing When He “Grabbed Hilarie Burton’s Breasts” During Taping of MTV Show,"Yesterday, actor Ben Affleck came out with a statement of shock over allegations that mega-Democrat donor and kingpin Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein raped and sexually assaulted multiple women in the industry. A disgusting audio tape was released yesterday by the New Yorker that was secretly done by then 19-yr. old Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez that showed how Weinstein used his position of power to make women perform sexual favors or take part in his sexual fantasies, or pay the (obvious and unspoken) consequences.Affleck, who is close to Harvey Weinstein and has spent a considerable amount of time around him, made the following statement on social media yesterday:tabloids He was quickly shot down by actress Rose McGowan who claimed he knew all about Harvey Weinstein s antics, despite his statement of fake outrage and disgust.  YOU LIE  she tweeted in response to Affleck s comments.You want to play let's play #ROSEARMY pic.twitter.com/uqd26Z78gc  rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 10, 2017Rose then went on to call all of the Hollywood  A-list  Golden Boys,  LIARS  and warned them,  We have just begun. But that wasn t the end of it for Affleck who seemed to be feigning shock over Weinstein s actions when according to at least a few young Hollywood actresses, he s got some explaining to do about his own actions.Hilarie Burton claims she was groped by Ben Affleck during his appearance on TRL in 2003.Daily Mail   The former host of the show made the allegations on Tuesday night, just hours after Affleck made a statement condemning Harvey Weinstein s alleged abusive actions in his sexual assault and harassment scandal.In it, he said he was  saddened and angry  over the  sickening  claims.Affleck s statement was quickly slammed by a number of people   including Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan who called Affleck a liar.When a fan tweeted that Affleck might as well have  kept quiet,  another Twitter user wrote:  He also grabbed Hilarie Burton s breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though. The One Tree Hill Star then surprised the Twitter thread by interjecting with:  I didn t forget. The incident reportedly happened when he appeared on the show in 2003. Burton was 21.A video clip from the show shows Affleck telling Burton a story mid-interview which appears to be about moves men use to pick up women.He leans his arm around the young host who is wearing a yellow bandeau dress. No groping is seen on camera but Burton noticeably jumps and looks shocked on the footage as Affleck smiles and returns to his seat.Here is how the exchange went down after a Twitter user suggested Affleck would have been better off keeping his mouth shut over the Weinstein allegations.Ben Affleck should ve just kept quiet.

11423,CNN INTERVIEW TURNS INTO SCREAMING MATCH When Activist Director Argues New “IRRELEVANT” Footage Of Michael Brown Is Game Changer [VIDEO],"(From CNN) New video captured hours before Michael Brown was killed shows the 18-year-old exchanging marijuana for cigarillos with the clerks of a Ferguson, Missouri, store, a documentary director told CNN on Monday.Director Jason Pollock, whose film  Stranger Fruit  debuted at the South by Southwest festival in Austin over the weekend, said the video shows that Brown did not rob the store before being stopped by police and that surveillance footage purporting to show Brown engaged in a robbery at the Ferguson Market and Liquor stores was actually video of Brown returning to the store to retrieve the cigarillos the clerks gave him. This is a shady store. We ve asked a lot of people in this community. You can buy weed at the store,  Pollock said. Pollock suggests that had this footage been released, it would ve altered the notion that Brown was shot after robbing the store. He learned of the footage from a St. Louis County police report that mentioned a video from 1:13 a.m. the day of Brown s death.In an earlier interview, in which he appeared alongside Brown s father, Pollock said,  What this video shows is that (police) lied to the world about what happened. They wanted to make Mike look bad, so they put out half a video to destroy his character in his death. Police say the new footage is irrelevant to their investigation. Investigators have previously said Officer Darren Wilson initially stopped Brown for walking in the street, not because the store reported a robbery.Watch CNN s explosive interview here:About 100 protesters gathered at the store Sunday night, forcing it to close, and gunshots were heard before midnight, but no one appeared to be injured, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Gunfire erupted last night in front of the Ferguson store where Michael Brown was captured on surveillance video shoving the store clerk around, and now seen exchanging marijuana, as rioters gear up for a new fight in Ferguson.

2939," WATCH: Jon Voight Gives Divisive Speech At Trump Inauguration Concert, Insults Abraham Lincoln","Unable to find any A-list celebrities to headline his inauguration concert, Donald Trump turned to has-been actor Jon Voight to give a short speech and it was pathetic.As President Abraham Lincoln s statue was forced to sit and watch, Voight took to the stage to introduce Sam Moore to sing and delivered some short remarks that immediately set the Internet ablaze with fury that makes us all understand why his daughter Angelina Jolie wants nothing to do with him.Voight portrayed Trump as a victim of lies and propaganda, and then pumped out pro-Trump propaganda that included claiming that God is on Trump s side and that Lincoln is happy about Trump being in the White House.

10052,DEMOCRAT LEGAL EXPERT Shocks The Left With His Take On Statues [Video],"Legal expert and Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley makes a case for why we need to ADD to statues and not take them down. He says we can learn more from keeping them up in direct opposition to what Democrats are saying:TURLEY RECENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE: George Washington may have survived the winter at Valley Forge, but he may not see the end of the summer of Charlottesville. Bishop James Dukes of Chicago s Liberation Christian Center and others are calling for the removal of his and Andrew Jackson s statues and and stripping of their names from parks. Dukes insists that these monuments are  a slap in the face and it s a disgrace  for African Americans given their history as slave owning presidents.The bishop s call for the removal of our first president s statue is the latest effort to strip away the names of historical figures over ties to slavery or segregation. There is a movement to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson (who helped establish Princeton as a world academic institution) from buildings and schools, due to his support for segregation. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, but last year, University President Teresa Sullivan was denounced by students and faculty for merely quoting our third president in a public message because he was a slave owner.The call to remove Washington s statue came less than a day after President Trump asked whether Washington would be next in the movement to remove statues like the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville. The statement drew the ire of CNN s Jim Acosta who described the notion as absurd and said it was  taken as a sign that the president perhaps needs a refresher course and needs to go back to History 101.  History is precisely where this controversy should begin and end. Washington is rightfully condemned for his ownership of slaves. There were contemporaries like John Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton who were outspoken critics of slavery. Franklin called slavery  an atrocious debasement of human nature,  while Adams referred to it as a  foul contagion in the human character.  These visionaries not only saw a great evil but answered the call of history to stand steadfastly against it.However, before Mayor Rahm Emanuel sends in the bulldozers into Washington Park, it is worth considering a few facts about our first president s history with slavery. Washington inherited a number of slaves at age 11 and received more slaves in his marriage to Martha Custis. However, he gradually came to oppose slavery. On the interim, Washington tried to assuage his guilt by refusing to sell slaves that would break up families, telling an associate that it was  against my inclination to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families. After the war, Washington continued to discuss ways to convert his plantation from slaves to tenants at the suggestion of his close aide (and outspoken opponent of slavery) Marquis de Lafayette. By 1786, Washington wrote his friend Robert Morris,  I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of [slavery]. In the end, Washington was the only one of nine slaveholding presidents (and the only slaveholding founder) who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington freed as many of his 317 slaves as possible. Some 123 slaves were his to emancipate while neither he nor Martha could free the so-called  Custis Dower slaves  (who remained property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington s first husband). He further ordered that all of the elderly or sick slaves would be supported by his estate for the rest of their lives.So where does this leave us? With a complex and flawed figure who practiced a great evil while belatedly coming to reject it. He finished his life allied with his more enlightened colleagues but this is no reason to forgive his prior history. However, that is the point of history. It is never some neat narrative divided cleanly between demons and angels. Washington was a great leader who held a nation together through sheer leadership and stands as one of the few leaders in history to refuse to become a monarch himself.Curiously, Dukes does offer a concession. Washington Park and Jackson Park could be formally named after former Mayor Harold Washington and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson or singer Michael Jackson. It is unlikely to convince those who view these statutes as not simply reminders of past leaders but past struggles in an evolving society. The same cannot be said for Michael Jackson.  Thriller  may be the best selling album in history, but the Battle of New Orleans still has more of a hold on history.The fact is that we often learn as much from the failures as we do the triumphs of historical figures. Washington ultimately proved to be an early transitional figure in our ugly history of slavery. Washington himself described his desire at Mount Vernon  to lay a foundation  for a  rising generation  with a  new destiny  other than slavery.For my part, I am proud to teach at the George Washington University, whose charter was paid for by Washington himself as part of that same final testament. Of course, that does not mean we could not make other improvements. Another school in Washington is named after a British king, George II, who kept our nation under colonial oppression. After all, the moonwalk and robot dance steps did have a transformative impact on my generation  and  Jacksontown University  has a nice ring to it.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

15172,BREAKING: RINO RESIGNS…Boehner Announces He’s Leaving In October After Five Long Years Of Supporting Obama’s Radical Agenda,"Boehner s hightailing it out of DC just in time to push funding through for Planned Butcherhood without having to suffer any repercussions. Boehner also manages to avoid the embarrassment of being pushed out by fellow Republicans in the recent move by conservative Rep. Mark Meadows of NC who filed a motion to  vacate the chair,  which could have forced a no-confidence vote by the full chamber and un-seat the unpopular Speaker of the House Speaker John Boehner, who rose from bartender s son to the most powerful man in Congress, will retire at the end of October, ending a tumultuous five-year tenure atop the House of Representatives. Boehner, 65, planned to leave Congress at the end of 2014, one of his aides said Friday morning, but returned because of the unexpected defeat of Eric Cantor. The Speaker believes putting members through prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable damage to the institution,  the Boehner aide said.  He is proud of what this majority has accomplished, and his speakership, but for the good of the Republican Conference and the institution, he will resign the Speakership and his seat in Congress, effective October 30.  On Thursday evening as he left the Capitol, Boehner (R-Ohio) told two reporters   one from POLITICO and another from the Washington Post   that he had nothing left to accomplish after he brought Pope Francis to the Capitol. When asked if he was resigning, Boehner laughed before exiting into an awaiting SUV with his Capitol Police detail.Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave, but it was that movement that gave him the most problems. Boehner s tenure will be remembered for his internal political battles, but also his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried   but repeatedly failed   to cut a deal on a massive fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the free-trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement systems.Now that he doesn t have internal political considerations to weigh, Boehner is certain to push through a government-funding bill next week that funds Planned Parenthood, and keeps the government open.Boehner s decision, relayed in a closed Republican meeting Friday morning, will set off one of the most intense leadership scrambles in modern Congressional GOP politics. Second in line is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is widely expected to serve as the next speaker. But there is serious unrest in the House Republican ranks, as a small clutch of conservatives have continuously clashed with more establishment Republican types. But it is unclear if any of these figures can win a leadership election.

5466, Fox News ‘Expert’ Will Now Be A Prison Expert For The Next Three Years,"He has been tried. He has been convicted. And now he has been sentenced for lying about his expertise and background to the United States Government.Fox News often brought Wayne Simmons aboard the channel to deliver his  expert  analysis on terrorism as a former CIA operative whenever a terrorist attack occurred somewhere in the world.Most notably, he appeared on the network after the terrorist attack in Paris last year that killed 130 people. Not only did he claim that there were hundreds of Muslim-controlled  no-go zones  across Europe, which Fox had to apologize for, he claimed that Muslims had 19 paramilitary training facilities in the Unites States.In January, Simmons appeared on Fox and called for surrounding these non-existent  no-go zones  with razor wire and shutting off utilities until all the Muslims surrender to be categorized by authorities.  That s how you close these no-go zones,  he said before using his false expertise to scare Americans with lies. It is incomprehensible that anywhere in the United States, these types of things would be allowed and, yet, my friend Ryan Mauro, as you probably know, reported that through the Clarion Project that we ve got at least 19 paramilitary Muslim training facilities in the United States. Are you kidding me? What are, what are they gonna do, go hunt deer during deer season? No. They re using paramilitary exercises to plan and execute these types of operations all over the United States. Here s the video via YouTube.But Simmons was soon outed as a fraud and now he gets to become a real expert at how to survive in prison.On Friday, Simmons was sentenced to serve 33 months behind bars portraying himself as an  Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer  for the CIA for nearly 30 years to get jobs within and outside of the government, which included his stint on Fox News and being sent to Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser.The 62-year-old was also sentenced by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to three years of supervision after his eventual release. He must also surrender two firearms and pay $176,000. Wayne Simmons is a fraud,  U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said.  Simmons has no military or intelligence background, or any skills relevant to the positions he attained through his fraud. Simmons frightened Americans for years through his appearances on Fox News and he put the lives of our troops in danger because of his lies.It makes one wonder how many other Fox News  experts  should be in prison right next to him.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"July 15, 2016",background government news channel expert analysis terrorism operative attack world network attack year people go fox training fox existent razor wire go friend clarion project training deer deer season video fraud expert prison officer government stint news intelligence adviser year district judge supervision release fraud attorney intelligence background fraud news danger news prison image

23194,Hillary’s ‘Russian Hack’ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThe longer this soap opera drags on, it s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not  hack  into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, however, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  Putin is hacking the US elections.  In response, the President is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyber-activity  tools.Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying, We re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.   Presumably, he s referring to a cyber  counter attack  by Washington.It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US?What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington s new anti-Russia movement.On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote,  The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  Russian hack  talking point was purely political, but then again, who s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media.You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words,  comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance.  If you ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?  said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami.Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia   not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system,  we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: The bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10,  Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like,  Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French:  bottom of the bag ) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle? It s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election.Behind Clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton s campaign manager John Podesta   giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out,  Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political,  cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima, the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  Russian government hacks    provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike. No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike s word for it.IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security.The Post s Nakashima then added: The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,  the joint statement said.   We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. Moscow s press secretary s reply:  This is some sort of nonsense,  said Dmitry Peskov.Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that Russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence, other than speculative guesswork, has been presented.Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  Russia did it,  thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona   are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the  Intelligence Community    all agreed that Russia did it. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,  said Clinton.  I find that deeply disturbing. What s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton s 17 agencies :Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta s emails? Answer: nothing.The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016. The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda.In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington s  flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party s decree that Russia is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney, when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are  hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the FBI also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the Trump team with Russia.  Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven t come up with anything.To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government s much vaunted Intelligence Community. Of course, that s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq s imaginary  Winnebagos of Death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks.For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  Washington Intelligence,  I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now,  No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We re not like that. No, this time it s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!  In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim s notorious  Bureau 121  hacked into Sony Pictures. This isn t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121.  Just like with today s  Russian Hack  theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the  Russian Hack  claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike.Jumping the SharkAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative.Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the West.   Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering  with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back.The biggest impact of @wikileaks? Shining a spotlight on Russia s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence  seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as  proof  that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign s desperate claims. It was embarrassing.They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead.Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger. The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video   their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization.Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened.To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,  said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race.  I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,  said Clinton.The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it.Party MeltdownWasserman Schultz s replacement didn t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches   showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to Hillary Clinton. A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN s Jake Tapper. A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.  (Source: Daily Caller)Brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: In addition, it was also revealed how CNN s head political commentator, Gloria Borger, was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the Clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage. You d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN s election coverage.Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5  400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016Worse Than WatergatePerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury   is the FBI s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. There s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe   a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times.So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia, and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top   to the President himself.What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton s server  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  The President s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton s private email server. So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails  off grid  with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server    maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it.Sure, he s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club   caught out lying to the American people.On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified.   The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News)It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action   that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case.On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case   currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a  sexting  scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik. Who is Kadzik?  Zero Hedge reports: Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary s Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik. Oh, and if that wasn t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as  best friends. FOX News confirms: Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,  Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks.To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it.Russia   The Party ScapegoatFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting:  Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville, was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused  the KGB  working with Republicans to  hijack the election  during his wild rant on MSNBC. I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That s what I think,  said Carville.Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB, and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991.These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence   unlike the Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that  Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.  They ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep   a perfect double entendre.The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for  sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry, Samantha Power, and John Kirby, already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown   that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed  rebels  Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki.With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks   and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said,  We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that.What s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although  Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17,  and  Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind.That said, it s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of  Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.  When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders. Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 ElectionOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era.Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere   if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry.Still, we re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington   before it s too late.READ MORE

19944,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HILLARY’S EYES…Could It Be Related To Parkinson’s Disease? [VIDEO],"Hillary spoke to a very small group of students at Temple University. With a total student population of just under 38,000, her estimated crowd of 300 would be considered by most, to be a total bust. Unfit Hillary wasn t about to let 37,700 disinterested students stand in the way of addressing 300 paid plants  students about the benefits of a taxpayer funded education or a President who is willing, on behalf of the American taxpayer, to forgive their debts What the heck is Hillary hiding now? What is going on with her eyes in this video?  We looked into symptoms of patients with Parkinson s Disease and here s what we found:Visual motor symptoms of patients with Parkinson s Disease:  Some vision difficulties are related to changes in the movement of the eyeball. These are motor symptoms, similar to other motor symptoms caused by loss of dopamine neurons.  Blurred or double vision, and eye strain, because the eyes may have trouble moving together to focus on things traveling toward or away from a person  Trouble reading, because the eye movements needed to follow the lines of a page are slowed and have trouble starting (similar to gait freezing in the legs)  A person with PD may need to blink in order to change eye position; levodopa can helpLet s put the eye issue aside for a moment and let s examine why Hillary has chosen to talk to this crowd of adults like they re a two year old sitting on her lap, while she reads them a bed-time book? No wonder millennials are leaving her in droves. She s not just a liar, she a a condescending liar as well. She doesn t have enough faith in these young adults to consider they may care about our national security or about getting a good paying job out of college. Her only concern seems to be how to woo them with the free sh*t vote her former opponent Bernie Sanders used to build his base.As The Gateway Pundit reported   Hillary was given assistance getting up the stairs to get to the stage.

1879, Trump’s Administration Was Just Caught Up In Prostitution Scandal; Here’s How It Went Down (DETAILS),"While it can be said that no one is immune from punishment, a terrific example of that fact is how a Secret Service agent who was on Mike Pence s detail just got himself arrested.Why was he arrested? For getting caught soliciting sex from a prostitute.According to CNN:  a Secret Service agent on Vice President Mike Pence s detail has been suspended from official duties after meeting a prostitute at a Maryland hotel. One law enforcement source says the agent was caught after police saw him exiting the hotel. Apparently, this is how it all went down: The police responded to a call from the hotel manager who became suspicious of activity in one of the rooms. The source said this was not a sting. Now, even though the agent was off duty and wasn t currently guarding the *vice president, it is still illegal to solicit sex.CNN reports: A Secret Service spokesperson, speaking on the record, acknowledges  an alleged incident  occurred and says it involved an off-duty Secret Service employee and said that the matter is under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the facts.According to the spokesperson, the employee was required to surrender his weapon and official gear and was placed on administrative leave. The employee s security clearance and access to all Secret Service facilities has also been suspended. Tsk tsk. You d think someone, especially in the Secret Service, would know better. Especially considering the history of prostitutes with agents in the Secret Service.Who can forget the Colombian prostitute scandal of 2012 when nine Secret Service agents had been discovered bringing hookers back to their rooms?Mike Pence s former Secret Service agent will be disciplined, but it still doesn t look good for the entire United States Secret Service, or the *vice president for that matter. And you can only guess the big guy in the Oval Office doesn t like it.

23252,ACTIVE SHOOTER OR DRILL? The Cascade Mall Shooting,"21st Century Wire says There have been a string of active shooter events prior to 2016 s first presidential debate this coming week   with many incidents appearing suspicious in nature. The Guardian reports that the apparent motive still remains unclear: A 20-year-old suspect was in custody on Sunday for the killing of five people during a deadly shooting at a mall in Burlington, Washington, two days before. Arcan Cetin of Oak Harbor, Washington, a legal permanent resident who had immigrated to the US from Turkey, was discovered  zombie-like , police said, on Saturday evening after police responded to a tip-off following an intensive 24-hour manhunt. Cetin was unarmed at the time of his arrest, authorities said. Although a motive for the shooting remains unclear, authorities told local media that Cetin s ex-girlfriend had previously worked at the targeted department store but left her job months ago. The suspect had been charged three times with domestic assault against his stepfather and had been ordered by a judge not to possess a firearm, according to the Seattle Times. At a Saturday press conference, the FBI said terrorism was not a suspected motive. Memory Hole below Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn HeltonCASCADE MALL SHOOTING AN  ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILL ?Memory HoleVictim Corpses Remain in Mall OvernightWitnesses Sequestered from PressPhotograph depicts porta-potties, hugs and smiles at sceneAs we have sought to document at MHB on a routine basis,  active shooter drills  are now common occurrences across the US. Such  training  is a consequence of the heightened federalization of local and regional law enforcement.The September 23 Cascade Mall shooting north of Seattle in northwest Washington State took place shortly before 7:00PM local time, and has certain suspect features evident in photos, particularly evidence of tents and porta-potties on the scene, as observed by a MHB reader.There is an absence of footage of wounded or deceased victims in triage or being given ambulatory services away from the scene. Instead, news media were told victims remained in the mall awaiting the local coroner. The Washington Post reports, As of Saturday morning, the bodies of the four female victims were still inside the mall, Skagit County coroner Hayley Thompson said at a news conference Saturday. Thompson said when she gained access to the scene, the four female victims would be taken to Skagit Valley Hospital and undergo autopsies. Such events are reported on by major news media uncritically, thus supporting the call for strengthened gun control measures while ironically stimulating gun purchases by a public that fears such restrictions.The Cascade Mall shooting s police spokesperson for the event is Washington State Patrol s Mark Francis.

2, Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People ‘In The Eye’,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

1282, London Mayor Just Told Trump To F*ck Off In The Most Spectacular Way,"After the Paris Accord, the United States under Donald Trump is generally seen as the baby in a high chair that s been pulled up to the table at which the adults are sitting   and leaders are more and more willing to openly express that sentiment because at this point any hope that Trump would prove naysayers wrong is out the window at this point.On Sunday, The Donald continued his attempts to harness the London Bridge attack to promote his agenda. While at one point this would have led to condemnation of his words, London s Mayor showed the world that it s time to just stop taking him seriously at all. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is  no reason to be alarmed!  Trump tweeted, attacking the mayor entirely out of context.At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017Trump didn t mention this, but he was referencing a BBC interview in which Khan explained that he has expanded police presence in the wake of the attack and that citizens should not be alarmed if they see more people in uniforms than normal. Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days,  Khan told the interviewer.  There s no reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police and all of us need to do is ensure that we re as safe as we possibly can be. He added that London  will never let the terrorists win. While only Donald Trump would have an issue with the Mayor letting citizens know not to be alarmed by increased police presence, at this point people just don t give a f*ck what he has to say.In a statement related to the attack, the Mayor (through a spokesman) hit Trump hard by telling him he s just not that important:Spokesperson for London Mayor Sadiq Khan: ""He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet"" pic.twitter.com/Vqpi3gOaTH  NBC News (@NBCNews) June 4, 2017 The Mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services, and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city,  the statement reads.  He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police   including armed officers   on the streets.

5468, WATCH: Fox News Host Calls President Obama Weak For Not Declaring War On ISIS,"Last time I checked, the Constitution still says declaring war is Congress  job.As a former lawyer and judge, one would think Jeanine Pirro would know what the Constitution says, but during an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday morning, she demonstrated why she should never have been allowed to be in the legal profession.In response to the devastating terrorist attack in Nice, France in which 84 people have been confirmed dead and 2020 injured, Pirro trotted out the Republican talking-point of blaming President Obama for the attack and claimed that he apologizes for America and persecutes Christians. If this President would stop apologizing for what we do and what we are and stop saying  you Christians, it s your turn  as he did at a prayer breakfast then maybe American would be united in a way that we understand that they re coming. They re here. I gotta tell ya. I m as aggravated as everyone who has sat in this chair today. We ve got a problem at the top of this country,  Pirro continued before summing President Obama s legacy as  weak. One word: Weak,  she said.  He just doesn t have a plan. He doesn t have a policy. He should be in academia. We ve got to declare war on them. We ve got to start having a conversation about surveillance on mosques  they just want to kill us! Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has never apologized for America. Nowhere is this clearer than when he visited Hiroshima, Japan and refused to apologize for the United States dropping the atomic bomb during World War II. President Obama is also not persecuting Christians. His policies include all Americans and do not target a specific religious sect.Furthermore, President Obama has done the best he can to fight ISIS with the authority and resources he has available and that has resulted in 26,000 ISIS fighters and half of their commanders being killed by United States and coalition forces.And if Pirro really wants to blame someone for being weak against ISIS, she should point her finger at Republicans in Congress who refuse to exercise their power to declare war on ISIS, which would give President Obama the full power to wage war against ISIS. But Republicans don t want to do that because they would rather put all the responsibility on President Obama so they can continue blaming him for each and every terrorist attack that occurs around the world for cheap political points.Just so Pirro and every other conservative out there understands what the separation of powers means, here s the part of the Constitution you are blatantly ignoring. Because it s either that or you ve never actually read the document you claim to love so much.Article I, Section 8: To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.Seriously, Republicans need to grow a pair and do their jobs if they really believe ISIS is a major threat to our country. If not, they should shut the hell up and stop attacking the only man in our government who is doing something.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"July 15, 2016",time constitution war job lawyer judge constitution appearance morning profession response attack people point president attack president turn prayer breakfast way everyone chair today problem top country president legacy word plan policy war conversation surveillance video president clearer japan bomb world war president sect president authority half coalition someone finger congress power war president power wage war responsibility president attack world separation part constitution document article section war grant marque reprisal land water pair threat country hell man government something image
3005," Civil Rights Icon John Lewis Got Bashed By Trump on Twitter, His Response Is PERFECT (TWEET)","Yesterday, President-elect Donald Trump embarrassed himself yet again when he hit back at civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis after the Democrat stated that he didn t consider Trump a  legitimate president    a sentiment that most Americans share.Just two days before Martin Luther King Day, Trump slammed Lewis on Twitter and said Lewis was  all talk, no action : Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad. Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!It was a disgusting statement to make about Lewis, who has been more involved in civil rights causes than most Americans and personally marched alongside Dr. King. Trump immediately got blasted for his remarks, but the best response yet is coming from Lewis himself. In a DNC fundraising email that was released last night, Lewis addressed Trump s ill-advised comments: Today Donald Trump attacked me on Twitter. He said that I m  all talk  and  no action. I ve been beaten bloody, tear-gassed, fighting for what s right for America. I ve marched at Selma with Dr. King. Sometimes that s what it takes to move our country in the right direction.We refuse to stop now. We re not done fighting for progress. We re ready for the next four years. Join me and chip in whatever you can today to help Democrats stand up to injustice. The email stated that any funds donated would be split between Lewis  re-election fund and the DNC.

Along with the increase of donations to Lewis  fund, Trump s disgusting tweets also caused a massive surge in book sales for Lewis. After Trump insulted Lewis, America responded by moving his 1999 biography, Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement  from the No. 15,918 spot to No. 15 on Amazon s bestsellers list. Sales spiked by nearly 106,020 percent! That move alone showed Trump how wrong he was.

18092,"DISGUSTING! UNEMPLOYED, RACE-OBSESSED Colin Kaepernick Will Be Added To Smithsonian Black History Museum, While Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Is BLACKLISTED","Few people, if any, keep track of ratings or public approval numbers for the Smithsonian. However, if they did, those numbers would soon go down dramatically. Why? Because the man who single-handedly accomplished the nearly impossible feat of turning America against its favorite game, is about to get his own exhibit.Most fans were not impressed with Kaepernick s disrespect of our American flag and of our national anthem. According to curators at the museum, currently unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is about to get his own display at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall.In fact, museum officials have already begun requesting various items of significance from Kaepernick s protests of last year.According to the Washington Examiner,  Artifacts from former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s national anthem protests will reportedly soon be on display at the Black Lives Matter collection at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has nearly 40,000 items in our collection,  said Damion Thomas, the museum s sports curator, to USA Today.  The Colin Kaepernick collection is in line with the museum s larger collecting efforts to document the varied areas of society that have been impacted by the Black Lives Matter movement. Incredibly, as pointed out by IJR and The Washington Times, the museum extends Kaepernick this honor while only mentioning African-American Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in connection with the sexual harassment charge brought against him by Anita Hill.  BrietbartI was opposed to welfare because I had seen its destructive effects up close in Savannah. Most of the older people among whom I had grown up felt as I did, sharing Daddy s belief that it would be the  ruination  of blacks, undermining their desire to wor & provide for themselves. I added that my own sister was a victim of the system, which had created a sense of entitlement that had trapped her and her children. I went on to say that I opposed busing, preferring to give school vouchers to poor children. Source: My Grandfather s Son: A Memoir by Clarence Thomas, p. 132-3 , Oct 1, 2007Quotes like the one above from Clarence Thomas have made him a target of the left. It really doesn t matter what color you are, if you don t tow the entitlement line that keeps you in the good graces of the Democrat Party, you will be punished. In Clarence Thomas  case, the punishment is that he will likely never see himself featured in the Smithsonian Black History museum.Here is a short biography of Clarence Thomas, that illustrates the unimaginable odds he overcame  to become a US Supreme Court Justice:Clarence Thomas was born in the tiny coastal town of Pin Point, Georgia, on June 23, 1948. As a very young boy he lived in a one-room shack with dirt floors and no plumbing. When Thomas was two years old, his father walked out on the family. As a result, at the age of seven he and his younger brother were sent to live with their grandfather, Myers Anderson, and his wife in Savannah, Georgia. Anderson, a devout Catholic and active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sent Thomas to a Catholic school staffed by nuns.In remarks reported by Jet magazine, Thomas has said that he grew up speaking Gullah, a creole dialect spoken by African Americans on the coastal islands of the southeastern United States. Unlike other Supreme Court justices, he rarely asks questions from the bench during court proceedings. He has said that he developed this habit of silent listening when he was young because he found it a struggle to speak  standard English  correctly in school. Nevertheless, he was always a strong student.Clarence Thomas went on to become a US Supreme Court Justice and champion of our Constitution.Apparently, the Smithsonian can t find space in their museum for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a highly accomplished conservative black man, who was born into poverty, and through sheer determination and hard work, became the longest serving black Supreme Court Justice in America s history.

15847,"JIHAD FOR DUMMIES: How US Army Enlistee, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan Was Caught Attempting To Bomb US Army Base","Note to little Johnny you might want to consider using a diary next time you write about how you d like to engage in violent jihad in the name of ISIS.A 20-year-old Kansas man plotted to kill American soldiers with a vehicle bomb at the Fort Riley military base, an attack he planned to carry out on behalf of the ISIS terror group, prosecutors announced Friday.John T. Booker, also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was arrested as part of a lengthy FBI investigation. Federal authorities said he was arrested near the army base in Manhattan, Kansas, as he completed final preparations to detonate the bomb, which had, in fact, been rendered inert while he was under FBI surveillance. As alleged in the complaint, John Booker attempted to attack U.S. military personnel on U.S. soil purportedly in the name of (ISIS),  said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.  Thanks to the efforts of the law enforcement community, we were able to safely disrupt this threat to the brave men and women who serve our country. Protecting American lives by identifying and bringing to justice those who wish to harm U.S. citizens remains the National Security Division s number one priority. Prosecutors said Booker repeatedly stated he wanted to engage in violent jihad on behalf of ISIS. He became an Army recruit and said he intended to commit an insider attack against American soldiers, like Major Nidal Hassan at Fort Hood in Texas.Booker is the latest among a number of ISIS sympathizers who have been arrested by the FBI in recent weeks.A criminal complaint unsealed Friday charged Booker with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives), one count of attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.He was due to appear Friday afternoon in federal court in Topeka.The criminal complaint Friday alleged that Booker spent months developing and attempting to execute a plan that would result in his own death as an ISIS suicide bomber. It also alleged that he  planned to pull the trigger of the explosives himself so that he would die in the explosion,  Kansas U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said at a news conference. I want to assure the public there was never any breach of Fort Riley Military Base, nor was the safety or the security of the base or its personnel ever at risk,  said Kansas City FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Jackson.  Recently the Command Staff at Fort Riley has been working hand in hand with law enforcement to ensure the utmost security and protection for the men and women who serve our country, and the surrounding community that supports the base. Booker allegedly plotted to construct an explosive device for attack on American soil for months during meetings with two FBI informants. He told one killing Americans was permissible because the Koran  says to kill your enemies wherever they are. Prosecutors said the jihadi wannabe advanced the plot by acquiring components for a vehicle bomb, producing a propaganda video and renting a storage locker to store components for the explosive device.Prosecutors said he identified Fort Riley as the target and talked about his commitment to trigger the device himself and become a jihadi martyr.His arrest came behind the wheel of a van he belived was packed with 1,000 pounds of explosive.Last year FoxNews.com reported exclusively that Booker was under investigation for threatening online to commit a  Fort Hood-inspired  act of terror just weeks away from reporting for basic training.The military learned of his radicalism   which had apparently been on display for months in online posts where he praised Usama bin Laden and pledged to die for radical Islam.FoxNews.com reported then that Booker was the subject of an FBI alert. Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush! I am so nervous,  read a March 19. 2014 post on the Facebook page authorities believe belonged to Booker.  NOT because I m scared to die but I am EAGER to meet my lord. FoxNews.com reported Booker enlisted in the Army in February 2014 and was due to report for basic training less than two months later on April 7. But the FBI interviewed him in March and alerted the Army, which formally discharged him.Via: FOX News",politics,"Apr 10, 2015",note time violent jihad name year man vehicle bomb fort riley base attack behalf terror group booker part investigation army base bomb fact inert surveillance complaint booker personnel soil name attorney carlin thanks law enforcement community threat brave men country security division number priority booker violent jihad behalf army recruit insider attack fort hood booker number complaint booker count weapon mass destruction count property count support organization afternoon court complaint booker plan death suicide bomber trigger explosion attorney barry news conference public breach fort riley base safety security base personnel risk city agent charge command staff fort riley hand hand law enforcement security protection men country community base booker device attack soil killing plot vehicle bomb propaganda video storage locker device riley target commitment device martyr arrest wheel van explosive year booker investigation fort hood act terror radicalism display bin laden booker subject alert jihad adrenaline rush march post page lord booker army training march army fox news

3508, Trump-Supporting KKK Members Charged With Attempted Murder After Vicious Assault,"Another day, another Trump supporter commits an atrocity, weakening America s morale one by one. This time, it s a double whammy   Trump supporters who happen to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.William Hagen, grand dragon of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (who organized a White Lives Matter rally), and Klan leader Chris Barker, were arrested in North Carolina after the two stabbed another Klansman, who eventually escaped with wounds to the chest.According to the New York Times:The attack took place hours before a Ku Klux Klan parade on Saturday in Roxboro, N.C., billed as a celebration of Mr. Trump s victory  Mr. Hagen was in North Carolina to attend that parade, the authorities said. Mr. Barker was arrested before the parade, and Mr. Hagen after, during a traffic stop, Captain Rose said.Hagen was charged with attempted murder and Barker was charged with aiding and abetting an assault.So far, no motive or reason has been released as to why the stabbing took place. But when it comes to the insanity of the  reasoning  used by Klansmen to justify violence, does it really matter? Since the rise (and election) of Donald Trump, violence and white nationalism   not coincidentally   has been on a rise in the United States. Today in North Carolina, the two came head-to-head.The victim, Richard Dillon, is being treated for his injuries and his attackers are being held without bail.Once again, the question needs to be asked: is Donald Trump going to denounce this kind of behavior? These men supported him, organized a rally in his honor, and voted for him. They ve been in the news as organizers for his campaigns, and now they have unsuccessfully tried to murder another human being (albeit one with deplorable qualities).The violence, hatred, and deplorabiltiy continues under Donald Trump, who gave new purpose to worst drudges of society.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"December 8, 2016",day trump supporter atrocity weakening time trump dragon leader barker wounds chest york attack place celebration trump victory barker parade traffic stop captain murder barker assault motive reason stabbing place insanity reasoning violence rise election trump violence nationalism rise today head victim bail question trump kind men rally honor news violence trump purpose society image
10584,BIKERS FOR TRUMP Bring Important Message and Help to Republican Candidate #KarenHandel in HUGE Political Battle,"Millions and millions of dollars from outside the state of Georgia have made their way to the campaign of Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff. The Georgia election has become a referendum on President Trump and could mean a symbolic gotcha moment for Democrats. This is a big deal for both parties! This is kind of like a crown jewel of the Republican Party right now   holding on to this thing.    Chris Cox, Founder of Bikers for TrumpWhile the Dems throw money at their candidate, the Republicans are bringing in the Bikers for Trump to go door to door in Georgia for Republican candidate Karen Handel.This race has gotten pretty ugly with vulgar letters containing white powder sent to Handel s neighbors. The left is really counting on this win but the vitriol only wins votes for Handel.Here s the note put in mailboxes in Handel s neighborhood   LANGUAGE ALERT!Much has been made of the fact that Handel s challenger doesn t even live in the district he s running in!FEAR MONGERING TO GET VOTES:Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) stood in front of 50 Jon Ossoff volunteers at a campaign barbecue and fear mongered to get the message out: The vote is precious and sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have,  he said.  There are some in this country who still seek to deny some of us our right to vote. We can fight back by exercising that right. NOTE TO JOHN LEWIS: NO ONE IS TRYING TO DENY ANYONE S VOTE! MARIETTA, Ga.   This neighborhood might have gotten quite a jolt when Bikers for Trump   sporting tattoos galore, black vests and a massive flag with the group s insignia   showed up in this Atlanta suburb to politely ask people to vote for the Republican candidate in this week s special congressional election.At one stop, Chris Hummel and his wife, Karen, assured Chris Cox, founder of Bikers for Trump, and the six other men and women who were going door to door that they had voted early for the Republican, Karen Handel, over Democrat Jon Ossoff. Mrs. Hummel even shed some tears after learning that three of the bikers had served in the military. Her father served as a battalion leader in the Vietnam War and returned a different man. Years later, when Mrs. Hummel was a baby, he took his own life. We have heard about them,  Mrs. Hummel said about the group.  I just think it is cool that it is just kind of grass-roots door-to-door, just common folks. Because that is really what America is.  Mr. Cox and his crew of volunteers had visited this well-groomed neighborhood before and returned Tuesday to make certain that its heavily Republican voters planned to   or already had   voted for Mrs. Handel. The bikers are hoping to punch a hole in the Democrat-driven storyline that President Trump s supporters are turning their backs on him. For us, it is more about  Support Donald Trump,  and by supporting Karen Handel we are supporting Donald Trump,  said Mr. Cox, standing in a cul-de-sac next to his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and steps away from a miniature soccer goal.

3913, The Toronto Star Published An ‘Unauthorized Database’ Of Things That Will INFURIATE Trump,"Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn t hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here.There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump s speeches. They re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy.Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form.The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons  corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton s health and Government corruption.They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with,  The electoral system is rigged.  Of course, it s rigged against him: After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election.  Rigged  became his catchword.He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired  thugs  to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis   cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats.In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. Nobody s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans.Another is,  Muslims are risky.  This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: His claims that Syrian refugees   99 per cent are Muslim   are terrorists plays to the fears of the  other,  even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump s claims   about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016. The polls favour Trump.  Har de har har   Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This  poll denialism  gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN.His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling   and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible.On Oct. 24, he said  I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.  In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost.Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote   and exaggerate   those numbers. But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also:And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.To see the full list and detailed analysis, click here.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 6, 2016",liar lie campaign trump liar thing bullying york times spread trump star dale trump paper list trump unique proof trump anything anyone candidate history people master liar anything master liar trump liar way shape star record corruption election trade economy health care trump immigration record campaign russia trump record sex assault health government corruption list trump analysis system course fairness election catchword campaign violence evidence video voter fraud st trump trust mail person supporter year police suspicion twice nobody voter suppression fraud nothing horse time cent trump trump trump poll polling data doubt legitimacy polling vote trump idea election poll fact poll course trump trump fit paper lying myth liar list analysis click image chip
14931,DEMOCRATIC DEBATE MODERATOR Met With Dem Candidates For Some “Pre-Interviews”….Hummm,"So the moderator of the Democratic debate met with the campaigns of the candidates but didn t give away any questions? Really? And we re supposed to believe this? A  pre-interview  took place to discuss the issues  at play in the race . Isn t that giving the questions away?I d call that a strategy session because we shouldn t forget that Ben Rhodes and David Rhodes are brothers This Saturday s second Democratic debate will be a much smaller affair than the first. With only three candidates on stage, CBS News plans to delve deep into the issues with each candidate and have taken advantage of the smaller pool by doing some intense research. Moderator John Dickerson and his team met with each of the campaigns for more than an hour to discuss the major issues at play in the race, sources on the campaigns said, describing the pre-interview as  informational in nature.  Dickerson is not giving candidates previews of his questions for the debate. Prior to the CNN debate, the campaigns said moderator Anderson Cooper did not reach out directly to them before the candidates took the stage.  Dickerson and his team were very interested in getting to better know the senator s stand on a wide spectrum of issues, what he would do about income inequality in this country,  said Bernie Sanders  spokesman Michael Briggs. He said they discussed issues where there are real differences between the candidates   including gun control, the death penalty and raising taxes on the middle class.  John Dickerson s a smart, impressive guy who cares a lot about the issues,  Briggs said.  I m sure we ll see a smart, issues-oriented debate.

Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Va., wounding five people including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.). Hodgkinson had penned a Facebook rant against Handel last week. My thoughts are with the victims of this morning s despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team,  wrote Handel, Georgia s former secretary of state.  Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. I also want to commend the heroic actions of the Capitol Police officers who clearly prevented today s attack from being a much bigger tragedy,  she wrote.Handel also addressed expletive comments that Hodgkinson made about her on social media.Hodgkinson posted an article about Handel to his Facebook, calling her a  Republican Bitch  who wants  People to Work for Slave Wages,  NBC affiliate WXIA reported. Republican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It s Right for You!  Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook. I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,  Handel said in her statement.  It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and loathed President Donald Trump and Republican policies.Handel echoed calls by others, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), for bipartisan unity following the attack. We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.

The lead sentence offered  A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials  and continued  While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a security matter, the penetration of the nation s electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability. Yet, it turns out this narrative was false and as the chronology below will show, illustrates how effectively false and misleading news can ricochet through the global news echo chamber through the pages of top tier newspapers that fail to properly verify their facts.The original article was posted online on the Washington Post s website at 7:55PM EST. Using the Internet Archive s Wayback Machine, we can see that sometime between 9:24PM and 10:06PM the Post updated the article to indicate that multiple computer systems at the utility had been breached ( computers  plural), but that further data was still being collected:  Officials said that it is unclear when the code entered the Vermont utility s computers, and that an investigation will attempt to determine the timing and nature of the intrusion.  Several paragraphs of additional material were added between 8PM and 10PM, claiming and contextualizing the breach as part of a broader campaign of Russian hacking against the US, including the DNC and Podesta email breaches.Despite the article ballooning from 8 to 18 paragraphs, the publication date of the article remained unchanged and no editorial note was appended, meaning that a reader being forwarded a link to the article would have no way of knowing the article they were seeing was in any way changed from the original version published 2 hours prior.Yet, as the Post s story ricocheted through the politically charged environment, other media outlets and technology experts began questioning the Post s claims and the utility company itself finally issued a formal statement at 9:37PM EST, just an hour and a half after the Post s publication, pushing back on the Post s claims:  We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization s grid systems. We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. From Russian hackers burrowed deep within the US electrical grid, ready to plunge the nation into darkness at the flip of a switch, an hour and a half later the story suddenly became that a single non-grid laptop had a piece of malware on it and that the laptop was not connected to the utility grid in any way.However, it was not until almost a full hour after the utility s official press release (at around 10:30PM EST) that the Post finally updated its article, changing the headline to the more muted  Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security, officials say  and changed the body of the article to note  Burlington Electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the Grizzly Steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organization s grid systems. The firm said it took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alert federal authorities.  Yet, other parts of the article, including a later sentence claiming that multiple computers at the utility had been breached, remained intact.The following morning, nearly 11 hours after changing the headline and rewriting the article to indicate that the grid itself was never breached and the  hack  was only an isolated laptop with malware, the Post still had not appended any kind of editorial note to indicate that it had significantly changed the focus of the article.This is significant, as one driving force of fake news is that as much of 60% of the links shared on social media are shared based on the title alone, with the sharer not actually reading the article itself. Thus, the title assigned to an article becomes the story itself and the Post s incorrect title meant that the story that spread virally through the national echo chamber was that the Russians had hacked into the US power grid.Only after numerous outlets called out the Post s changes did the newspaper finally append an editorial note at the very bottom of the article more than half a day later saying  An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid. Yet, even this correction is not a true reflection of public facts as known. The utility indicated only that a laptop was found to contain malware that has previously been associated with Russian hackers. As many pointed out, the malware in question is actually available for purchase online, meaning anyone could have used it and its mere presence is not a guarantee of Russian government involvement. Moreover, a malware infection can come from many sources, including visiting malicious websites and thus the mere presence of malware on a laptop computer does not necessarily indicate that Russian government hackers launched a coordinated hacking campaign to penetrate that machine   the infection could have come from something as simple as an employee visiting an infected website on a work computer.Moreover, just as with the Santa Claus and the dying child story, the Post story went viral and was widely reshared, leading to embarrassing situations like CNBC tweeting out the story and then having to go back and retract the story.Particularly fascinating that the original Post story mentioned that there were only two major power utilities in Vermont and that Burlington Electric was one of them, meaning it would have been easy to call both companies for comment. However, while the article mentions contacting DHS for comment, there is no mention of any kind that the Post reached out to either of the two utilities for comment. Given that Burlington issued its formal statement denying the Post s claims just an hour and a half later, this would suggest that had the Post reached out to the company it likely could have corrected its story prior to publication Continue this story at ForbesREAD MORE MSM FAKE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 9, 2017",media billionaire jeff post paper record world news post wave fear breathless headline electricity utility sentence code hacking operation steppe administration system utility code utility condition anonymity order security matter penetration nation grid vulnerability narrative chronology news news chamber tier article post wayback machine sometime post article computer utility data code utility investigation timing nature intrusion material breach part campaign hacking podesta article ballooning publication date article editorial note meaning reader link article way article way version post story environment media technology post utility company statement hour half post publication post department organization action finding ready nation darkness flip switch hour half story non piece utility grid way hour utility press release post article headline operation utility risk security body article electric statement company code grizzly steppe operation organization firm action article sentence utility morning headline article grid hack post kind note focus article force news links media title sharer article title article story post incorrect title story chamber power grid post newspaper editorial note bottom article day version story indication computer electric grid correction reflection utility question purchase anyone presence guarantee government involvement infection presence computer government hacking campaign machine infection something employee work computer child story post story story story post story power electric comment article comment mention kind post comment statement post hour half post company story publication story news century wire watch subscribe member
2118, WHOA: It Appears Trump Leaked Classified CIA Info To Fox News," I just want people to know, the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken   that was during the Obama years. That was not during us,  Trump recently told Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson during an interview.  That was during the Obama situation. Mike Pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job. In saying those words, it appears that The Donald did something against which he has been railing ever since his administration began leaking more than two Russian prostitutes in a certain orange man s Moscow hotel room: he leaked classified information.Now as President, Donald Trump can declassify any information he wants, but Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California points out that Trump did not make a purposeful decision  to do that. He just talked. In his effort to once again blame Obama, the President appeared to have discussed something that, if true and accurate, would otherwise be considered classified information,  Schiff said in a press release. The president has the power to declassify whatever he wants, but this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input form any agency affected. For anyone else to do what the President may have done, would constitute what he deplores as  leaks,  Schiff says. He also took to Twitter to rail against Mr. Number 45 for applying a different set of rules to himself than others:.@POTUS appears to have discussed something that, if true & accurate, would be classified. Had it been anyone else he would call it a ""leak"" pic.twitter.com/XedWH4CTNF  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 16, 2017Interestingly, Trump doesn t consider little things like his administration s ties to Russia to be matters of public interest. Or his tax returns. Or anything else that could expose him for exactly what he is.But if Trump is in the business of declassifying information, he could easily answer any questions Americans have about Russia with a stroke of his pen.Do it, Donald.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"March 16, 2017",people lot news propagandist tucker interview situation mike job something administration orange man hotel room information president trump information rep trump decision effort president something accurate information press release president power product consideration input form agency anyone president number set something accurate anyone pic twitter trump administration interest tax anything trump business information russia stroke pen image

7094, Hotel Workers Smashed Trump In A MASSIVE Victory,"Bad news for Donald Trump! Despite his objections, workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, just delivered a huge f*ck you to The Donald with the assistance of the National Labor Relations Board. Since the employees voted to unionize in December, Trump has been fighting racist tooth and Islamophobic nail against the idea that workers deserve some modicum of self-determination   but it seems that even his  huge  hands were not enough to stop the NLRB from officially certifying the union.This comes after numerous dirty tricks, including the use of scare tactics and ironic attempts to convince the Board to throw out the workers  vote because employees were allegedly  intimidated  into agreeing to unionize in the first place. But, of course, it was Trump s goons doing the intimidating: They pressured us a lot [to vote no],  housekeeper Marisela Olvera told ThinkProgress.  They told us the union only wants our money, that if we supported the union we d lose our jobs, that the company would put our names on a blacklist and no other hotels in Las Vegas would hire us. They told us to think of what our children would do if we were out of work. Everyone was very stressed. People were afraid. But bendito sea Di s, we still won, even with all that pressure. Now, Think Progress reports that (with Trump s appeal going about as well as his attempts to win over anyone who isn t a white, straight Christian male) workers are demanding that management tuck its tail between its legs, sit down with them like adults, and work out a contract. We re just waiting for a contract,  housekeeper Maria Jaramillo told the publication.  We deserve one. We re not second-class workers. So we re here, waiting for him. Unfortunately, they may have to wait a while longer. Management says they intend to appeal the Labor Board s decision:Jaramillo and her coworkers then formed a bargaining committee, hoping that management would soon recognize their union and begin negotiating with them. But the Trump hotel signaled this week that they have no intention of doing so. We will continue our fight to ensure a fair election for our valued associates, many of whom vigorously oppose union representation,  said Jill Martin, an attorney for The Trump Organization, in a statement to reporters.  The hearing officer s recommendations erroneously disregarded the severe misconduct undertaken by Union agents, which clearly impacted an incredibly close election.  Trump management has until next week to formally challenge the NLRB recommendation, and then the Board s regional chapter will determine whether or not to certify the union. Even if the local board backs the workers, Trump can further delay by appealing their ruling to the federal board in Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump is a very good business man,  linens worker Rosebert Donato told ThinkProgress, apparently using a loose definition of both  good  and  businessman. Donoto hopes Trump will grow up, put on his big boy pants, and sit down to discuss things with the workers. He says he wants to make America great,  Olvera says.  Well, he should start here in his own house, his own business. He always brags about how he has millions and millions and millions of dollars, but he pays his workers less than most in Las Vegas.

This guy is the definition of a bitter has-been who NEVER was a true conservative in the first place. I want to continue to be a Republican because it annoys them    Former Secretary of State Colin PowellFormer Secretary of State Colin Powell joked that he identifies as a Republican to annoy the GOP s right-wing. Yes, I m still a Republican,  he said about his party affiliation during the Washington Ideas Forum in Washington, D.C., according to the Daily Mail. I want to continue to be a Republican because it annoys them,  Powell quipped to host Walter Isaacson. I think the party has shifted much further right than where the country is and it should be obvious to party leaders that they cannot keep saying and doing the things that they were doing and hope to be successful in national-level election in the future, not just in 2016,  he added.Powell said a small faction in the GOP is alienating voters with their rhetoric on immigration. I think most Republicans understand that we need immigration, we are an immigrant nation [and that] it is in our best interest to do it,  he said.

6163, Vince Foster’s Sister Is FURIOUS With Donald Trump,"Donald Trump has a strategy to defeat Hillary Clinton, and that s to re-litigate decades of anti-Clinton conspiracy theories   theories that should have been put to bed years and years ago.The ugliest of those theories is that Hillary Clinton had her friend Vince Foster murdered   this despite the fact that numerous investigators, including Clinton attack dog Kenneth Starr, have said that Foster s death was suicide and now his sister is speaking out.Here s more on Trump s accusation:In an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of Vince Foster, said this to Trump:It is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of Donald Trump displayed in his recent comments to The Washington Post. In this interview, Trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, Vincent W. Foster Jr., may have been murdered because  he had intimate knowledge of what was going on  and that Hillary Clinton may have somehow played a role in Vince s death.How wrong. How irresponsible. How cruel.************************************************Five investigations, including by independent counsels Robert B. Fiske Jr. and Kenneth Starr, concluded that Vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep, unable to work, unable to think straight, and finally to take his own life.Anthony goes on to say that she and her brother were very close and that he called her a few days before he died saying that he needed help for depression. She found three psychiatrists, but help wasn t early enough. He killed himself three days later. That was only the beginning of her nightmare. The right took the story of Foster s suicide and tried, desperately to pin it (and everything else) on the Clintons.These outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain because this issue went on for so long and these reports were so painful to read. For years, our family had to wage a court fight to prevent release of photographs of Vince s dead body. My heartbroken mother was plagued by harassing phone calls from a reporter.Anthony has kept mostly quiet throughout the years, but Trump bringing this up again, many years after this has been settled, is too painful for her, and for her family, to endure.The fact is, that Trump will stop at nothing to appease his ego and win the ultimate political prize. This election will be ugly. A lot of people, who have put the past behind them, will have old wounds opened. Hillary Clinton, like all political candidates, is flawed, but she s not a murderer and to imply so is beyond unethical. Trump is only proving that he s not fit for office, any office.Featured sketch of Vince Foster via Wikipedia.

1968, April Ryan Describes In Harrowing Detail What It Feels Like To Be Abused By Sean Spicer (VIDEO),"By now, everyone is aware of the appallingly abusive way in which White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer treated American Urban Radio Correspondent April Ryan during Tuesday s White House Press briefing. All Ryan was doing was, well, HER JOB, and asking about the cloud of Russia investigations hanging over the embattled Trump Administration. This caused Sean Spicer to completely lose it, and launch into condescending, sexist, and racist attacks on Ryan.After the press availability was over, Ryan spoke with MSNBC s Katy Tur about her experience, addressing the accusation from Sean Spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts. Ryan told Tur: I don t have an agenda. We ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple, how do you change the perception problem? And it went off into this Russian dressing, no shaking my head or whatever. You cannot ignore, as a reporter, there are issues on Capitol Hill. You have investigations going. You have the head of the intel committee coming here to the White House briefing people, the president himself. I understand what Sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now. And unfortunately, I was roadkill today. No matter what Sean Spicer s job is, he had not right to treat April Ryan that way. She was just doing her job. If he can t handle tough questions, he should find another line of work. To flat-out deny all of those investigations, and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the Trump White House is a huge story is truly beyond the pale. Until they come clean about the Russia business, this will continue to be a story. The White House Press Corp would derelict in their duties if they didn t continue to press Spicer on this.Good on you for being a superb member of the Fourth Estate, Ms. Ryan. You handled Spicer s abuse with grace and dignity.

3193, CNN Host STUNNED As Trump’s Team REFUSES To Comment On Russian Hacking (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s team certainly doesn t make it easy for the people who have to interview them. In a typical interview with Trump s team, news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring Trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question.On Monday s  New Day,  CNN host Alisyn Camerota had to interview Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, and it was basically an interview from hell as Spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions. Camerota had tried to ask Spicer just what special information Trump claimed he knows about Russia s involvement in the US election. Spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said Trump gets a lot of  classified information, intelligence reports  on a daily basis (despite the fact that Trump s team once said the president-elect only gets briefings once per week). Spicer then went off topic and said Trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking, ignoring the fact that Trump has defended Russia extensively from all blame.Camerota was unwilling to let Spicer avoid the question, and she said: I want to get back to my question. Is Mr. Trump, who said he s going to reveal something, he says he knows things. Spicer again refused to give a response, stating that Trump would talk about it himself right before blaming Obama for not talking about China s 2015 hacking. Camerota responded by fact-checking Spicer right then and there. She said: Sean, just to correct you, you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the Chinese hacking. I have the statement right here in my hands. Spicer s response was pathetic, as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame Obama, accusing Obama of responding too late. Camerota tirelessly tried to bring Spicer back to her question: Sean, I m more interested in what Mr. Trump is going to do. We re not electing President Obama again. You are representing Mr. Trump. Camerota asked about Trump s plans, and Spicer couldn t provide her with anything. All he did was confess that Trump didn t have a final report. Spicer then stunned Camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said Trump had been briefed: The report is not final. He s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community. A stunned Camerota said in disbelief,  He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking? Spicer began to fall apart when Camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non-final  reports of being irresponsible. Spicer shouted, No! Not, hold on! The idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable. The rest of the interview, Camerota was forced to constantly counter Spicer s moronic remarks. Spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting Camerota for expecting that Trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the Russian hacking are correct. Spicer said condescendingly: I know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way. No, we re going to get all the information, get briefed properly and make a decision. We re not going to put the cart before the horse. Camerota couldn t believe her ears.

16047,"FLASHBACK: KEY DEMOCRATS Call for Violence in the Streets…”March, Bleed, Die” [Video]","And we wonder why violence like today s shooting happened The left started with the violence during the 2016 and continued to escalate it once they lost. We have key Democrats calling for violent resistance in the streets Sick!Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? Speaking of p*ssies On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to the at the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?Obama s former AG Loretta Lynch released a video that s a call to action for Democrats. These people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming America into something most Americans wouldn t recognize, are serious about starting a civil war in our nation. If you don t believe me, listen to the words of Obama s former AG, who compares the fight against President Trump and his supporters to that of the Civil War:  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. (Lynch s statement about the Founding Fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama to destroy the very fabric of our Constitution.) It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They ve marched, they ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again. We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him.

7623, Anti-Vaxxer Parents Let Toddler Die Of Meningitis After Maple Syrup Fails To Cure Him,"A Canadian couple is facing charges after their plan to avoid  harmful  medicine in favor of maple syrup and other home remedies failed to cure their young son of his meningitis. The 19-month-old died after two weeks of rapidly worsening illness without medical attention.The couple, David and Collet Stephan, are Mormons who run a nutritional supplement company in the United States. They were charged with the death of their child and face up to five years in prison if convicted.Sadly, the death of this toddler didn t come from ignorance, but from the malicious anti-vaccination movement, which deliberately spreads false information about medical practices and advocates in favor of unproven  natural  cures that alternate between the effectiveness of a placebo and down-right harm. Tapes played for the court featured Collet Stephan telling officers that a nurse friend pleaded with the couple about their son s illness, telling them it was a life-threatening case of meningitis. Rather than heed the nurse s warnings, the couple opted for home-brew concoctions.In a bid to boost his immune system, the couple gave the boy who was lethargic and becoming stiff   various home remedies, such as water with maple syrup, juice with frozen berries and finally a mixture of apple cider vinegar, horse radish root, hot peppers, mashed onion, garlic and ginger root as his condition deteriorated.Court heard the couple on tape explaining to the police officer that they prefer naturopathic remedies because of their family s negative experiences with the medical system.Perhaps most disturbingly, the couple continues to maintain that they did nothing wrong. On social media and in comments to the court, the Stephans have shown nothing but contempt for the judicial process. In the aftermath of his son s death, David has accused the government of attempting to force families like his to vaccinate their children. The fact that the child died because the government didn t force him to vaccinate his children is a point that seems to have eluded him.As other cases have done in the past, the plight of the Stephans and the victimization of their children (yes, they have other   unvaccinated   children still living with them), reminds us that this is not just an intellectual exercise or an example of the government overstepping its role. The anti-vaxxer movement, and its supporters, are putting the lives of real children at risk when they opt for maple syrup remedies over scientifically-tested medical care. No child should have to die because of their parents bad decision-making.

Yes, Daddy s little girl was likely hoping   like the rest of her family   that she would be able to use her father s position to make a lot of money, but things aren t working out quite that way.Nordstrom was recently targeted by the  Grab Your Wallet  campaign, which encourages people to avoid shopping at any stores that do business with the Trumps. Bloomberg reports that the department store chain has elected (like other businesses) to stop selling Ivanka Trump s brand this season based on abysmal sales. Whether this was because every single one of her products, like every member of the Trump family, save Barron, is terrible, or because of the boycotts cannot be said for sure, but in any case, her products have already disappeared from the retailer s online store. Some products will remain on the shelves for now, but they will be gone as well. In this case, based on the brand s performance, we ve decided not to buy it for this season,  the company said in a statement. Grab Your Wallet co-founder Shannon Coulter says she is  thrilled  with Nordstrom s decision to drop Ivanka Trump. Though some Trump supporters are threatening their own boycott if Nordstrom drops Ivanka s sh*tty merchandise, they can t expect much sympathy from the company. In an email to employees, co-president Pete Nordstrom said that the concept of  if people don t buy it, we won t sell it  applies in this situation.Though the company says the decision is sales-driven, it is entirely possible that they just want to distance themselves from Ivanka, who has already attempted to use her father s presidency to push her products. Her company sent a  style alert  to journalists Monday promoting a bracelet that Ivanka wore during an interview with  60 Minutes  about her father   a clear sign that the Trumps know nothing about avoiding conflicts of interest:As Donald Trump continues to threaten to send troops to Mexico, f*ck up diplomatic relationships with countries that have been our strongest allies since World War I, waste our tax dollars on his stupid wall, and attempt to discriminate against an entire religion solely based on his own bigotry, we can expect his daughter s brand to continue to suffer   as well it should.Featured image via Boston Globe",News,"February 3, 2017",trump presidency friend daughter line pounding girl rest family father position lot money way grab wallet campaign people shopping business department store chain trump brand season member trump family cannot case retailer store case brand performance season company statement grab wallet founder decision trump trump boycott sh merchandise sympathy company president pete concept people situation company decision father presidency company style alert bracelet interview father sign nothing interest trump allies world war tax wall attempt religion bigotry daughter brand image boston globe
2838," Trump Is Building Literal, Actual Concentration Camps For Undocumented Immigrants","It s beginning. While some dismissed Donald Trump s campaign promises to ban Muslims from entering the country, dismantle our country s healthcare, build a giant goddamn motherfucking wall to keep brown people from entering the country, and every other horrific thing you can think of and more as  just words  he was using to get stupid people to vote for him, he meant every single one of them   and he s been proving it.One of President Asterisk s first acts was an executive order that is the beginning of his efforts to dismantle Obamacare. He followed up by signing away our environment and authorizing the building of two controversial pipelines, stripping federal funds from international health organizations that so much as mention abortion (in an order conveniently following millions of women lining the streets to protest him). He then withdrew us from a major trade agreement without a single thought about the repercussions, began funneling our tax dollars into his stupid wall, ordered a weekly report on crimes committed by  aliens  and banned Muslims from seven countries he hates from entering the country.Trump even authorized the building of new camps in which undocumented immigrants could be concentrated   for a limited time, of course   until they could be deported (I feel like there s a term for these things, but I can t quite place it). The Washington Post reports: The presidential directives signed Wednesday aim to create more detention centers, add thousands of Border Patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws. One order calls for the  immediate construction of a physical wall. In short, if you re a member of this group that Trump considers undesirable, you ll be sent to one of these camps and any city that might otherwise harbor you will face extreme penalties for doing so. We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,  Trump told a crowd of DHS employees Wednesday.  Beginning today, the United States gets control of its borders. Trump also vowed to investigate alleged voter fraud in blue states   particularly in  urban  (that s right-wing slang for  black ) areas   so he can prove once and forgodamnall that he actually won the popular vote, because he really is that petty.It hasn t even been a week since Trump took office and he has already made it clear that he has declared war on the American people. The question remains: just how much are we going to take of this bullshit?Make no mistake about it: people will die in Trump s camps and his supporters will applaud.This. Is. Not.

He did not say how the United States collected its intelligence.The White House said on Monday it appeared the Syrian government was preparing for another chemical weapons attack and warned Assad that he and his military would  pay a heavy price  if it went ahead.REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO DECIDED HE WOULDN T HONOR HIS THREAT TO SYRIA:THE RED LINE READ MORE: REUTERS",left-news,"Jun 28, 2017",deputy assistant president president evidence week regime chemical people damage chemical development attack pentagon spokesman jeff activity base cruise missile strike specific aircraft hangar chemical activity day intelligence house government chemical attack price commander chief threat line
16421,"GARY JOHNSON: Meet The “Creepy” Pro-Amnesty, Anti-Gun, Pro-TPP, Pro-Abortion, Democrat Party Operative And His Anti-Gun Rights, Friend Of Clinton’s VP Pick [VIDEO]","For anyone who believes they re more CONSERVATIVE than the average Trump supporter because they re planning to vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate, former Governor Bill Weld you may want to re-think your  conservative  position. It turns out, you re really just voting for another Barack Obama without the race card to fall back on or Hillary without the criminal background Libertarians should be allergic to power grabs by the executive for the obvious reason that they lend themselves to concentrated authority and (usually) bigger government. If you want to slow the state down, a robust, sharply divided Congress that jealously guards its constitutional prerogatives from the president should be your ideal   even in cases where the executive happens to be acting towards an end you deem salutary. In this year of all years, admirers of Obama s various forms of overreach should be thinking hard about how President Trump might build on his precedents. To a constitutionalist, which most mainstream libertarians claim to be, all of this is second nature.Is Gary Johnson a constitutionalist?THRUSH: How about Obama s executive order, which was decried as being a great constitutional violation by the Republicans, Obama s executive order on immigration. Did you consider that to be a violation or did you consider that a reasonable use of targeted executive power?MR. JOHNSON: I saw it as a reasonable use, challenging Congress to action. And an untold story with regard to Obama and immigration is he s broken up 3 million families. He has deported 3 million heads of households that have gone back to Mexico and their families have remained in the United States.If Obama issued an executive order to the IRS demanding that they collect 10 percent more in tax from individuals than the Internal Revenue Code provides, would Johnson deem that legal? What if the order instructed the agency to collect 10 percent less tax? Would his opinion of its legality change? Because it shouldn t. Bear in mind, Obama s 2014  DAPA  amnesty has already been blocked by a preliminary injunction that was upheld on review by the Fifth Circuit so Johnson had plenty of legal cover here to say that he s troubled by Obama s procedural approach despite the fact that he happens to agree with the policy ends. Instead he seems to endorse the bizarre legal theory pushed by some leftists that if Congress isn t moving quickly enough for the president s taste in enacting a policy he supports, he can go ahead and  challenge  them by enacting it himself and leaving it to Congress to overrule him if they feel strongly to the contrary. How the hell does a libertarian arrive at that model of government? The president does what he wants, and then it falls to the people s representatives to try to muster a two-thirds majority to override his policy? What?

According to Newsweek, Weld and Hillary both worked together on the House impeachment committee in 1974 and almost worked for Bill during Bill s presidency in 1997. Weld has also gone on to say that he does not believe Hillary is in the wrong or should be punished for her emails.

21605,DOJ CONTINUES OBSESSION WITH DISCREDITING FERGUSON POLICE With This Ridiculous New Report,"No word on when Soros will be put on trial for paying protestors to riot or when Al Sharpton will be charged with inciting the riots with his inflammatory racist rhetoric (All comments in italics are opinions of 100% FED Up!)According to a report  from the U.S. Department of Justice, police responding to race-related protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer made a series of missteps, including antagonizing crowds with attack dogs and military-style tactics.Yeah..because the people inciting riots, burning down businesses and threatening anyone who dared to drive through Ferguson are probably pretty credible witnesses when it comes to  missteps  by the Ferguson Police Department. The report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, is a draft summary of a document the DOJ plans to release in the coming weeks evaluating law enforcement actions. A Justice Department spokesperson said the  after-action assessment   will convey the findings and lessons learned. The report focuses on the tactics of police from Ferguson, St. Louis, St. Louis County, and the Missouri Highway Patrol. All four agencies tried to quell the protests and riots that broke out after a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, on Aug. 9, 2014. We are always willing to engage in constructive dialogue about best practices,  the St. Louis department said in a statement.  We are interested in the final report to identify what we did well and what we may need to improve upon. How improving number of arrests made for arsonists/rioters who burn down businesses to make a statement? The Justice Department draft report, which covers actions over the 17 days following the shooting, found that police lacked effective protocols, were not adequately trained, struggled with communication and coordination, and made mistakes that sometimes heightened tensions.The use of dogs for crowd control during the Ferguson protests incited fear and anger in the crowd, according to the report, while the use of teargas on people without warning was also a problem.In addition, police were inconsistent in using force and making arrests, and some officers removed their nameplates to evade accountability for their actions, the Justice Department said.The report also criticized police for positioning snipers atop armored vehicles to monitor the crowd through rifle sights, saying the tactic  served only to exacerbate tensions. Yeah because why would the cops in Ferguson be concerned about their own safety when clowns like this are openly walking around advocating for violence against Officer Wilson?It found that law enforcement agencies set a negative tone with the media by initially offering limited public information about Brown s shooting. The report also said police inhibited protesters constitutional right to free speech.In all, the report lists 45 findings along with recommendations for improvements.Via: Reuters",left-news,"Jun 30, 2015",word trial racist rhetoric italics report department justice police race summer series dogs style tactics people anyone police department report copy draft summary document law enforcement justice department action assessment report tactics police st st county highway police officer shot dialogue st department statement report number statement justice department draft report days police communication use dogs crowd control fear anger crowd report use people problem addition police force accountability justice department report police crowd tactic safety violence officer law enforcement tone media information report police right speech report
20090,COLIN POWELL SAYS HILLARY LYING About Private Email Server Conversation: “has no recollection of the dinner conversation” [VIDEO],"For anyone who s paying attention, Hillary just got caught in ANOTHER big lie Former Secretary of State Colin Powell  has no recollection of the dinner conversation  recounted by Hillary Clinton to FBI agents, as documented by journalist Joe Conason in a forthcoming book.Conason s anecdote, reported Thursday night by The New York Times, recounts a small dinner party at Clinton s Georgetown home toward the beginning of her time as secretary of state, with former secretaries Madeleine Albright, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice also in attendance. During that dinner, Conason reports, Albright asked the former secretaries to impart advice to Clinton. Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer,  Conason wrote in his book  Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,  of which the Times said it acquired an advance copy. Powell, according to Conason s account, told Clinton that  his use of personal email had been transformative for the department  and  thus confirmed a decision [Clinton] had made months earlier   to keep her personal account and use it for most messages. A spokeswoman for Powell s office issued a statement following the Times  story:  General Powell has no recollection of the dinner conversation. He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department. At the time there was no equivalent system within the Department. He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information,  the statement continued.  The General no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton. It may exist in State or FBI files. Watch here:Powell s pushback comes amid an ongoing legal dispute between Clinton s lawyers and Judicial Watch over whether the conservative legal watchdog group can depose the former secretary of state as part of its lawsuit over State Department records.Read more: Politico",left-news,"Aug 20, 2016",anyone attention lie secretary state colin recollection dinner conversation journalist joe book anecdote night york times dinner party home beginning time secretary state henry rice attendance dinner advice state department computer book man world bill times advance copy account use department decision account spokeswoman office statement times story recollection dinner conversation secretary memo use account state department time system department secure state computer desk information statement longer secretary state dispute watch watchdog group secretary state part lawsuit state department politico
21798,SHOCKING REPORT: MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED THAN YOUNG BLACK MEN BY WHITE COPS,"We all knew this but we also know that the reporting is very biased in favor of the Trayvon Martins or Freddie Grays of the world.

23412,HAWKISH DOVE: The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireGOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is a populist candidate among a bevy of warhawk rivals  yet many still wonder how the real estate mogul has marched virtually unabated towards the 2016 Republican nomination.Undoubtedly, the stir Trump has caused this election season is already historic. Love him or hate him, the well-known businessman and reality TV star turned American political juggernaut is emerging as a surprising voice for US national interests in the face of an ever-increasing globalized world.Below we ll examine Trump s shocking rise in American politics, his strengths, his weaknesses and what he s up against   HAWKISH DOVE    Who s the real Donald Trump? (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Curious Case of Donald Trump Back in 1993, brothers David and Tom Gardner founded The Motley Fool stockbroker consultancy, and at the time, it took the investment world by storm. Their mantra was simple: in business (as it is most everything else in life) timing is everything, and when a market or system becomes insular and stagnant, the conditions are ripe for a  rule breaker , and eventually, the rule breakers becomes the rule makers. This spirit of guerilla business also underpinned the Silicon Valley revolution in the 1990s and 2000s.Likewise, Donald Trump read the tea leaves and saw an opportunity in 2016.If you believe the United States is ruled by an elite establishment or is a country taken hold by statism, endless foreign intervention and crony corporatism, chances are you might be considering Donald Trump as your candidate of choice in the 2016 presidential election   and you wouldn t be alone. Similar sentiments are felt on the left-wing by supporters of Democratic Party outsider Bernie Sanders.Trump s outsider tag and anti-establishment veneer, is what seems to be resonating most among a broad base across America, as many believe that the country has been in a decline following two failed administrations in the White House under both Bush and Obama.This is the nature of populist campaigns and whether you like Trump or not, he s run one of the most effective presidential campaigns in American history, despite major backlash from the media and various political pressure groups attempting to stop his rise.The New PopulistsMuch like former Republican congressman Ron Paul in 2012, and to a lesser degree with Bernie Sanders, Trump has seemingly tapped into a cultural zeitgeist rarely seen in American politics as this year s preeminent populist choice.While Paul s staunch constitutional and libertarian beliefs propelled his popularity in 2012, it s Trump s cross-spectrum political thinking that s drawing supporters to his campaign marked by an ability to reach the average blue-collar worker, as well as successful entrepreneurs by bringing up issues concerning economic growth, immigration and global trade.To some critics however, Trump is not conservative enough, even though he s already unveiled one of the most comprehensive plans to uphold gun rights in modern history. The plan includes a proposal for nationwide concealed carry without placing a ban on certain types of guns or magazines   something which has become a hot button particularly for those on the left after a string of strange mass shooting events during much of 2015.On the other side of the political fence, many have criticized Trump s antiquated views on expanding torture techniques in the military, as well as his tough talk on internet security, privacy concerns and heavy stance on illegal immigration.The term  super-nationalistic  is being batted around to describe Trump s perspective, causing some to fear the unknown.Ironically, what has led to Trump s success has also hindered him and has arguably become a major weak point for the shrewd businessman.Trump s fiery rhetoric concerning certain issues facing America today, in some cases has worked against him, and has painted a target on him, opening the door for the media to spin anything he says, or doesn t say, or what others say about him.This is perhaps best exemplified with his tough talk on illegal immigration, along with his media counter attack against professional agitators and protesters at his events following several clashes at some of his rallies over the past few weeks.Unfortunately, his detractors and political rivals have already used these social triggers to attack the GOP frontrunner, as his Chicago rally was cancelled after erupting into a chaotic scene, leading to at least 5 arrests. Similarly, his St. Louis rally was also stormed, leading to 32 arrests, with much of the media joining in condemnation of the embattled businessman.While no one should condone the violence that results from Trump supporters clashing with outside political agitators at Trump s campaign events, critics insist that Trump has somehow escalated these volatile protests through his own incendiary language and for not using his powers of persuasion to  calm things down. Later on in this article, we ll take an even closer look at what s behind these seismic uprisings at Trump s campaign rallies.The Manhattan mogul s political story has only just begun and there are many things to consider concerning the embattled GOP frontrunner   WAR LIES    Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell and the Bush administration s findings revealed a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that led to over half a million deaths in the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. (Photo link foreignpolicyjournal)Alternative To War?Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine   and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line.Calling Out  Bad  Global Trade   TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP    US leaders vote in favor of cloaked trade deal involving Asia pacific countries and America in 2015. Trump has been the only presidential candidate talking about the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and its vast implications on the global economy.The Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP trade deal, is something we ve covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past two years, as international trade law for new trade treaties appear to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement.As global policy makers continue to merge with the interests of multinational or transnational corporations to achieve their goals, we could view the TTP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as having zero national loyalty to any existing nation-state or its set of laws.These multi-national and transnational free trade deals have been vigorously opposed by Trump during many GOP debates this election cycle. Other critics of these deals have suggested they are being used as a way to gain a foothold on  property rights  in the future, in addition to having lasting implications on intellectual property.21WIRE previously outlined the role that the United States Trade  Representative has played in facilitating these deals between different industries: Understanding the power structure behind these draconian trade deals reveals the global chess play at work and the behind-the-scenes corporate merger s, under the watch of a biased government entity, the USTR. The USTR has been doing heavy lifting through its corporate connections with the likes of Haliburton (ESG and KBR) and Monsanto Corp, and  political insider  ties for a massive trade deal that will consolidate our future   all done outside of the democratic process.  This past week, Huffington Post published an article entitled  At Secretive Meeting, Tech CEOs And Top Republicans Commiserate, Plot To Stop Trump, : Billionaires, tech CEOs and top members of the Republican establishment flew to a private island resort off the coast of Georgia this weekend for the American Enterprise Institute s annual World Forum, according to sources familiar with the secretive gathering. The article goes on to say that the participants  couldn t help  discussing Trump   but he was not the sole purpose of the meeting. Here s some of the list of attendees as reported by HuffPo: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), political guru Karl Rove, House Speaker Paul Ryan, GOP Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who recently made news by saying he  cannot support Donald Trump. Recently, it was reported by Cleveland.com that  Ohio lost 112,500 jobs in 2015 resulting from the United States  trade deficit with countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, the EPI s findings state that an estimated 2 million jobs have already been lost due to the TPP and that half of those were in manufacturing industry.Above all else, Trump s non-interventionist outlook on the Middle East and his diplomatic approach to Israel and Palestine, as well as his strong position on free trade deals such as the TPP and TTIP, have all contributed to placing the outspoken candidate on the political chopping block.Such is the curious case of Donald J. Trump   AMERICAN PSYCHO?    Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney propelled Trump s campaign despite his desperate appeal to the public last week in a staged pre-debate speech. (Photo link cowgernation)Political Attack DogsThe anti-Trump coalition consists of the Republican Party establishment, the Leftwing and the mainstream media   and each of these factions are presently at war with Trump and his campaign.From the onset, you could see the horror in TV broadcasters eyes when confronted by Trump   a media mogul himself who knows how to conduct a symphony on the airwaves. In many respects, he s their worst nightmare   a politician who can outplay them in their media manipulation game.For the American Leftwing, he induces revulsion, and for good reason   his ability to tame the media has enabled him to discard the political correctness which governs US media discourse.The most sustained attack however, is coming from his own party. In the September of 2015, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how neoconservatives within the Republican Party were incensed when Trump first launched his presidential campaign bid over the summer. Flashing forward to now, it s even more apparent that the media and the dying GOP party elite have attempted to shanghai Trump and the public during his unexpected political rise.Since last summer, there s been a host of media pundits and Washington figureheads looking to take on Trump in a kinda of metaphorical Thunderdome, something which has routinely played out before millions of TV viewers   and one by one, each has become politically castrated, spayed or otherwise cast aside by the outspoken tycoon.You don t have to take my word for it, just ask Meghan Kelley, Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, as well as former FOX News favorite and PNAC (Project for a New American Century) waving neocon, Marco Rubio   a list, that may now include Mitt Romney, following his dirty, scripted propaganda speech meant to quell Trump s primary rise.It seems this year more than any other, the American public has peeled away at the politically fixed halls of FOX, CNN and others, as mainstream networks have deliberately attempted to derail Trump through a plethora of designer media attacks, timely  gotcha  questions, ambush-style interviews and scripted debate forums working in concert to keep the apparent GOP outsider off-balance throughout the entire presidential nomination process.  Astute observers of the GOP nomination process, might conclude that many media personalities, political insiders and beltway lobbyists are comfortable with America s long ago chartered cruise towards global ambiguity and perpetual stagnation, rather than to take a chance on new blood.In fact, The Grand Old Party pet-parade nearly flatlined last week after enlisting Bain Capital businessman and former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney to unleash a scathing nationally televised assessment of Trump s presidential qualifications.Bain Capital, is an investment firm with a rich history of litigation concerning claims of disgruntled investors over profits, as well as a global company with big ties to military defense, aerospace and big agricultural giants like Monsanto.Romney s recent pre-GOP debate speech appeared to be a last-ditch effort directed by neoconservative strategists to silence Trump s campaign   but it led to a huge backlash and in the process, revealed the former governor s role as political spoiler (and thus damaged goods), as evidenced by his support of Bush-approved candidate John Kasich.Romney s speech, piggy-backed anti-Trump hashtag campaigns (#nevertrump and #stoptrump) that emerged in the weeks following an article by well-known neoconservative strategist, Peter Wehner on why he wouldn t support a Trump presidency.Here s a You Tube clip of Fox News contributor Judge Jeanine Pirro condemning Romney for awakening a sleeping giant  among the US electorate The Shape of ThingsMitt Romney and the billionaire boys club are out for blood.Trump is using big media to put out some  dangerous ideas    like the prospect for a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, and d tente with Russia, and also calling out the clear fraud of the Iraq War, as well as NATO s bombardment in Libya as Trump stated, Libya would be better off if we had left Gaddafi in power. If the politicians had gone to the beach instead, and did nothing, we d be better off in Libya and Iraq than we are today. Romney represents the financial and investment wing of the military industrial complex and an Israel first foreign policy. Along with John McCain, Romney is one of their  inside men  embedded inside the US political establishment.This is what Trump is really up against.It doesn t stop there, the dirty politricks continued this week as Rubio urged his supporters to vote for rival presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio John Kasich (a close Bush-family friend), with the Florida Senator stating, If you re a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don t want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. Incidentally, Jeb Bush met with  three non-Trump candidates  (Cruz, Rubio Kasich?) in Miami this week, a month after dropping out of the presidential race, due to his poor campaign results. The situation was described by the Wall Street Journal as the following: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his 2016 candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn t offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump s path. On another interesting note, early in March, according to The Hill, CEO of FOX News, Roger Ailes, dropped his support for Rubio, if true, the move would signify this latest strategy to use Romney and Kasich as a way to undermine Trump s campaign. Here s the excerpt reported by The Hill: We re finished with Rubio,  Roger Ailes told one of the network s hosts recently, according to three unnamed sources.  We can t do the Rubio thing anymore. Flashing forward to this past week, Trump loyalist Roger Stone, wrote a revealing article entitled  Ted Cruz, A Bush By Another Name,  which detailed GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s close relationship to the Bush family. Here s a  passage from Stone s recent piece at The Daily Caller: Neil Bush, the son of President George H. W. Bush, who defrauded U.S. taxpayers out of $1.5 billion dollars in the savings and loan scam, and later peddled influence for the Chinese government, (who plied him with Chinese prostitutes) has formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president. You can t make this stuff up. The Bush-Cruz connection is clear. Ted was George W. s brain when he ran for president. A top policy adviser, Ted maneuvered for Solicitor General in Bush World but settled for a plum at the Federal Trade Commission. Ted s a Bush man with deep ties to the political and financial establishment.  Ted and wife Heidi brag about being the first  Bush marriage    they met as Bush staffers. SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz comes up  empty  on Obamacare as government continues debt scamAs the political claws are fully out now, the recent words of Pulitzer prize nominated journo, Jon Rappoport, comes to mind: A true populist leader would accept the fact that working through usual channels, to bring about stunning changes, is a loser. The enemy is entrenched. The enemy controls the landscape. The enemy controls the machinery. Where is the populist s strength coming from? Only one place: the people who are supporting him. So he has to go back to that well, over and over again. And now he can. While pondering Trump s rivals and populism, there s a deeper agenda concerning 2016 and beyond, something which was recently pointed out here at 21WIRE.In October of 2014, The Boston Globe published a stirring article rarely seen in the mainstream entitled  Vote all you want. The secret government won t change. The Globe piece covered Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon s detailed perspective on the political process in America. The article included an in-depth discussion about Glennon s book  National Security and Double Government,  a book that gives the public an inside look into the collusion between neoconservative and neoliberal political strategy on the global stage   in particular, counterterrorism policies that are routinely followed by president after president.The idea of concealed policy between neoconservatives and neoliberals was further confirmed when Robert Kagan, a co-founder and co-author of The Project for the New American Century, recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.This was a big story, but it barely kept the media s attention span for longer than a week.Indeed, Kagan s endorsement should provide a window for people to see the so-called (neo) conservative players behind the scenes that might have helped Clinton escape the Benghazi scandal and might step in to rescue her from her ongoing national security related email case with the FBI.Clinton s exploits in Libya are well documented and her recent endorsement by neocon strategist Kagan, is just one more glaring example of political complicity, no matter who gets elected as the president of America, the foreign policy machinations are controlled by the same operators.Coincidentally or not, Kagan also appears to be linked to Romney s anti-trump plea to the public.In a catchy call to arms, a deeply biased political plea was published on the website called War On The Rocks. The piece featured an impassioned rant from those directly connected to the military industrial complex. In fact, many war party operatives, put their seal of approval on the message including Robert Kagan, as well as Former Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, (the Chertoff Group manufactured the TSA body scanners used in most major airports) as well as over hundred other political operatives.To those aware of these tactics, the War On The Rocks Trump hit-piece, read like a foreign policy business as usual dossier, with a heavy-handed characterization of mogul, while completely misrepresenting some of Washington s most notorious military interventions in recent memory.  TRUMP CARD    Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump posters adorn Trump s Nevada caucus rally. (Photo link ulinet)Socially Engineered  Flash Mobs  Go Viral The political game changers are fully after the Trump campaign now, as the George Soros funded advocacy group MoveOn, played a large role in the Chicago University student organized shutdown at the Trump rally this past Friday, as well as a host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and supporters for Bernie Sanders.  BLACK BLOC   Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement. (Photo link examiner)The echoes are still felt from the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and the Baltimore riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action.  CHICAGO CHAOS    Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally. (Photo link twitter)Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn, also supported the Obama campaign in 2008, according to the website, Sanders is the only other candidate to  threshold for an endorsement. From here on out, professional political agitator flash mobs, will be mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign   taking away Trump s strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed in Ohio recently, after a BLM activist and Sanders supporter, stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking.In a Politico article entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter,  we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,  said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to  boost  Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Any bloodshed at the hands of   vigilante mobs  at Trump rallies, should be the responsibility of those who of have sought to politicize and fund this agenda from the very beginning.Look for these political engineers, to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other at Trump s rallies or events in the future   as all of these hostile uprisings are by design.During the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been  tracking specific members  of the Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists, The Weather Underground. Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was an interloper looking for new recruits that were easily manipulated into hostile action.This begs the question: Are government agencies still infiltrating political advocacy groups to push social change?The disruptions at Trump rallies are a form of modern class warfare, one that disguises its true intentions, eroding national sovereignty through a series of upheavals, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.Amazingly through it all, Trump s still been able to confound his opposition in the aftermath of a barrage of attacks, propelling his popularity even to even higher levels.The Ides of March primaries will be a good barometer to see what impact these chaotic clashes may have on Trump s campaign moving forward.It still remains to be seen if Trump s dynamic political vision for America will push the country further into authoritarianism or whether he can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world.But one thing is for sure   there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unseat the GOP frontrunner and the public should question why READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"March 14, 2016",century trump candidate bevy estate nomination stir trump election season well

[Video],"The last accuser who could have been the nail in the coffin for Bill O Reilly spoke on The View about her sexual harassment lawsuit. Perquita Burgess and her lawyer were on The View for their 15 minutes of fame. Attorney Lisa Bloom should know better than to send her client on to speak out about her allegations. Lisa Bloom has a track record as a high profile lawyer for cases like this She should know better but it could be that she s trying to gain sympathy for her client.Please listen to the video and let us know what you think about what she said and about sexual harassment in the workplace:O Reilly settled with other women over sexual harassment but how do we know if any of them has any credibility? How does a man protect himself from such charges?If this could be brought up on charges, then every high profile man out there needs a witness when he walks around anywhere.Are the comments (if true) that this woman said Bill O Reilly made considered sexual harassment to you? What exactly is sexual harassment? If it s how you feel then men are in big trouble because of all of the  offended  women out there. Should the definition be broader or should it be more narrowly defined. We feel with our litigious society, the cases for sexual harassment should be very closely scrutinized.

14670,Clinton Campaign Attack Dog Warns Trump And Sanders To Stay Away From Bill’s Infidelity,"Hey, everything is fair game in this war to win the White House. The Clintons have their attack dog in John Podesta who s about as radical and devious as they come. It s pretty interesting that all of a sudden the Democrats are saying you need to keep it clean. They certainly don t have the moral high ground in anything political. Podesta must be desperate. What a putz!A top aide for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s campaign on Monday ripped attacks on Bill Clinton s past infidelity by GOP rival Donald Trump, saying Trump has gone  in the gutter. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta also issued a warning to Clinton s Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to stay away from the topic. I hope he s not going there,  Podesta said of Sanders during an appearance on MSNBC s  Andrea Mitchell Reports  after the host noted it seems  there s some piling on here  by Sanders. He said that he s going to run a positive campaign, that he wasn t going to go in for personal attacks and I take him at his word on that,  Podesta continued. But I hope he s not thinking about going there, because, again, I think what Trump has done to go in the gutter is reprehensible,  the Clinton campaign chairman added. PODESTA ON BRINGING BILL S SEXUAL EXPLOITS INTO THE CAMPAIGN:  Sanders fielded a question late Friday at a town hall in Iowa about Bill Clinton s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton is not Bill Clinton. What Bill Clinton did, I think we can all acknowledge was totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. But I am running against Hillary Clinton. I am not running against Bill Clinton,  Sanders told the questioner, according to The Washington Post.Trump has for several weeks knocked the Clintons over Bill Clinton s sexual history, and on Sunday argued that Hillary was  an enabler  for her husband.Clinton s campaign manager maintained on Monday that Bill Clinton  remains an asset for us.

2578," Instead Of The Middle East, Trump Sent His Terrorism Taskforce To The Midwest; Why?","Donald Trump has no real platform other than be afraid, be very afraid. In Trump s imaginary world, we are all about to be wiped out by terrorists, but not the gun toting right-wing Trump follower type. No, we re all about to be killed by green card holding people from countries from the Middle East, but not actually from the countries that have ever attacked us. Earlier in the week, Trump s Press Secretary said this: I don t think it should be any surprise that the president, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his   keeping this country safe,  Spicer said.Source: OPBIf that s the case, then why the hell is the FBI terrorism task force worried about some peaceful protesters in the Midwest?The Guardian reports that the Trump administration has its FBI terrorism task force harassing people who are protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, instead of working to protect the lives of, you know, the American people. Instead, Trump seems to be redefining the word terrorism to fit anyone who interferes with his corporate or personal agenda. In this case, it s people who might interfere with oil company profits. The idea that the government would attempt to construe this indigenous-led non-violent movement into some kind of domestic terrorism investigation is unfathomable to me,  said Lauren Regan, a civil rights attorney who has provided legal support to demonstrators who were contacted by representatives of the FBI.  It s outrageous, it s unwarranted   and it s unconstitutional. Source: The GuardianNot only is this about enriching his buddies, but there is apparently a direct conflict of interest.Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river.There is so much that s disconcerting about this. Three days after a right-wing Trump supporting actual terrorist shot up a mosque in Canada, Trump removed any mention of right-wing terrorism from the website. Instead, he said he wanted to focus strictly on Islamic terrorism. So where exactly do protesters in the Midwest, many of whom are Native American fit in? It s simple, they don t. Trump is creating a new police state. We are either with him or against him and if we are against him, well, we too could be called terrorists. Oh, and did I mention that he wants to torture terror suspects?Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images.",News,"February 10, 2017",trump platform trump world gun trump follower type card people east week trump press secretary surprise president terrorism focus country spicer source case hell terrorism task force trump administration terrorism task force people access pipeline people word terrorism anyone agenda case people oil company idea government movement kind terrorism investigation attorney support source conflict interest trump investor energy transfer firm pipeline executive action week office project pipeline river days wing trump terrorist mosque trump mention terrorism terrorism fit trump police state mention terror image
8625, Watch Stephen Colbert’s Hilarious Response To Sarah Palin’s Crazy Speeches (VIDEO),"No one is happier to see Sarah Palin back in the news than Stephen Colbert. Following the former Alaska governor s endorsement of Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, Colbert now has plenty of material to make fun of the woman he called  the original material girl. God I have missed you. It s like a magical eagle made a wish on a flag pin and it came to life,  Colbert said of Palin s reappearance.  Which is great, for me,  he said,  because while Trump, admittedly, has given me so much material to make jokes about, nobody compares to the original material girl. Colbert played some of Palin s so-called  greatest hits,  referring to bizarre statements Palin made about  community organizer  Obama,  drill, baby, drill  and  we re gonna kick ISIS s ass!  Colbert said:  Sarah Palin just guaranteed Donald Trump the Evangelical vote, because I think she was speaking in tongues! While Donald Trump has been a frequent target of Colbert, no one has come close to the original  material girl.  Palin was a primary target of Colbert s during his 10-year run of his Colbert Report on Comedy Central.There s truly lots to make fun of. It seems that Palin has gone off the deep end lately more so than ever before. She even had the nerve to blame the president for her son s delinquency and her rambling speeches give a clear impression of someone that doesn t seem to have things together.In any case, Trump, who apparently is excited about Palin s endorsement, said that he would have a position for her in his administration, possibly vice president. It all sounds quite frightening.

4430, Trump Will HATE This Mexican Magazine For Unmasking Him On Their Cover (IMAGE),"Mexico does not like Donald Trump, and for good reason. He s accused their people of being rapists and killers, said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with, and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for. One Mexican literary magazine, called Letras Libres, decided to illustrate what they think of Trump after all of this. Their October issue features him on the cover, and it s not in a flattering light:En nuestro n mero de octubre: pic.twitter.com/xhMFnU9ttR  Letras Libres (@Letras_Libres) September 28, 2016That  stache is reminiscent of Hitler s mustache and reads  fascista Americana,  or,  American fascist. Suffice it to say, the editors at Letras Libres aren t thrilled with Trump, either.One expert on the history of fascism said that Trump s nonstop, offensive ethnic stereotyping, and his fear-the-foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism. Mexico is a foreign country. Their people are foreigners, and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs, both inside and outside our borders. He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline, when it isn t, is likewise textbook fascism. He s got the entire world worried, confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle, and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there, but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax. Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there, but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country, even though they don t have to pay it here. Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up. Trump doesn t know what he s talking about. But that is, in fact, just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us, and must be stopped.In other words, Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is. He may not quite be Hitler or Mussolini (yet, mostly because he s not in charge yet), but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",trump reason people country trash wall magazine trump issue cover flattering light pic twitter mustache suffice trump expert history fascism trump stereotyping fear fascism country people trump ability country decline textbook fascism world election cycle hell thing complain tax tax value tax tax country pay trump millions needs fact claim trump charge streak image

In response to Santorum saying publicly that same-sex marriage will lead to man-on-dog sex, Savage re-defined the word  Santorum  to mean the  frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. Worse, enemies of Santorum rigged it so that googling the Republican s name would only produce results that led to that definition. Hence, Santorum probably didn t spend much time asking people to Google him.Until Thursday night. Brave of him because, fortunately, Google no longer produces the new definition as a search result.

21727,GET OUT OF JAIL FREE: How Obama’s Race War Is Quietly Being Funded By Jay Z,"Keep buying Jay Z and Beyonce s music and keep telling us you like their music and see no connection between buying their music and using it to fund Obama s race war Rap mogul Jay Z has quietly used his wealth to post bail for people arrested in protests across the United States against police, an author close to him said Sunday.Dream Hampton, a writer and activist who worked with Jay Z on his 2010 memoir  Decoded,  made the revelations in a series of messages on Twitter that were deleted but were posted by the hip-hop magazine Complex. When we needed money for bail for Baltimore protesters, I  hit Jay up, as I had for Ferguson (and he) wired tens of thousands  of dollars within minutes, read one tweet.She also tweeted that Jay Z and his pop superstar wife Beyonce wrote a  huge check  to support the burgeoning  Black Lives Matter  movement aimed at stopping police brutality.Protests spread last year after a white police officer shot dead African American teenager Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.Major demonstrations, some turning violent, erupted last month in Baltimore after another African American man, Freddie Gray, died from a spinal injury sustained in police custody. The tweets appeared aimed at defending Jay Z and Beyonce, who have faced accusations from some activists that they have only paid lip service to the cause without tapping into the couple s estimated $1 billion net worth.Hampton later wrote that she deleted the tweets because Jay Z  would be pi-issed to see I was offering evidence  that he is taking action.Jay Z on Saturday performed in New York as an exclusive for Tidal, the music streaming service he has launched with fellow stars.In a freestyle segment, Jay Z paid homage to Brown and Gray   and belittled Tidal s rivals Spotify and Apple.Jay Z and Beyonce met with Brown and Gray s families last week at a peace concert in Baltimore by Prince, leaving without making public appearances.The power couple are also strong supporters of President Barack Obama, throwing a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for him during his 2012 campaign.Via: Yahoo News",left-news,"May 18, 2015",jay music music connection music race war rap jay wealth bail people police author dream writer activist memoir series twitter hip magazine complex money bail tweet jay pop wife check movement police brutality spread year police officer shot st suburb violent month man injury police custody jay lip service cause couple worth jay evidence action jay york music streaming service segment jay homage apple jay week peace concert prince power couple president multimillion dollar campaign news
1099, Obama Shows Trump What A Classy Father’s Day Message Looks Like After Trump’s Twitter Meltdown,"Donald Trump has been consumed with a seething anger and frustration lately that s slipping into everything he does. This week, his Twitter messages rose to an even more disgusting level of vitriol as the scandals and crimes his administration has perpetuated continue to come to light. On Father s Day, a time most Americans were taking as an opportunity to honor and remember their dads, Trump was on Twitter lying about Obama.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017This is in line with what sources are telling reporters. According to aides, Trump is barely coherent, ranting at television screens and mad at the people investigating him.Trump advisers and confidants describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation, yelling at television sets in the White House carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy to discredit   and potentially end   his presidency. Some of his ire is aimed at Rosenstein and investigative special counsel Robert Mueller, both of whom the president believes are biased against him, associates say.Meanwhile, former President Obama   whose popularity has only risen since handing the office over to Trump   put on a masterclass of how to handle a simple Father s Day tweet. (Hint: Instead of ranting and raving, try talking about the positive relationship you have with your kids.)Of all that I've done in my life, I'm most proud to be Sasha and Malia's dad. To all those lucky enough to be a dad, Happy Father's Day! https://t.co/ya1YAJignC  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 18, 2017The contrast is telling. Trump is most proud of an (outlier) poll saying he s at 50% approval. (His real number is closer to 38%.) Obama is most proud of his kids, Sasha and Malia.And lest Trump supporters think Obama is only doing this now that he s retired   here s how Obama marked Father s Day last year while president.Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there. Glad to be spending this one with my family in Yosemite. https://t.co/SaNJgmoIK1  President Obama (@POTUS44) June 19, 2016Trump has yet to mention Father s Day at all.One final point that is sure to make Trump furious: Obama s message of love and affection for his family was retweeted by 35,000 people as of this writing.

5590," Racists Try To Fire Actor For Saying Black Lives Matter, Most Powerful Woman In TV Shuts ‘Em Down","Racists and conservatives were very angry that Grey s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams called out racial inequality after receiving a humanitarian award at the recent BET Awards ceremony. In his speech, Williams explained who the award was really for: Now, this award, this is not for me,  he said. This is for the real organizers all over the country, activist civil rights attorneys, the parents, the teachers, the students who are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. All right?  he explained.  It s kind of basic mathematics, the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Despite its peaceful yearning for racial understanding, for some reason conservatives and racists were set off by the speech. An online petition was launched, asking that Williams be fired from his position on the TV show, and said he  spewed a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people at the BET awards.  The petition creator, Erin Smith, compared the speech to racist outbursts from TV personality Paula Deen and a homophobic rant from actor Isaiah Washington.But Shonda Rhimes, the creator and producer of Grey s Anatomy, who has been called the most powerful woman in television, did not bow to the online mob.The ShondaLand producer fired back Monday night at a 7,000 signature-strong Change.org petition calling for ABC to ax Williams   who plays hunky Dr. Jackson Avery on the doctor drama   in light of his much-praised speech inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Um, people? Boo don t need a petition. #shondalandrules,  Rhimes tweeted.Rhimes has used her programs to advocate for racial and gender equality, and her programs have been a ratings bonanza for ABC. She currently has four programs on the air; in addition to Grey s they are Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, and The Catch.

11105,ANTI-TRUMP TEACHER Wears “Tuck Frump” Jacket During Classes…Student’s Snap Goes Viral,"A disrespectful teacher at Sherman Jr Senior High School in West Virginia wore a  Tuck Frump  jacket during classes. A student s picture went viral.We re just wondering why this teacher wasn t fired on the spot! She s promoting her political beliefs in school and disrespecting our president with a twist on profanity. Not funny and not cute no matter how short the time was that she wore the jacket her excuse doesn t fly.What say you?BOONE COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ)   Boone County Schools is investigating after a picture of a teacher is circulating on social media and getting major attention. The picture shows a teacher inside her classroom wearing a jacket with an anti-Trump patch on the back of it.The snapshot was of Sherman Junior High and High School teacher Cheryl Judy who is an art teacher at the school.The picture shows Judy sporting a jean jacket with a play on words, disrespecting President Trump.Judy confirmed  that she is the one in the photo, but says it does not show the whole story. She says she wore the jacket to school without the anti-Trump patch and pinned it on during school hours, trying it on for just two minutes to make sure the patch was on straight. She says in the short period of time she had the jacket on inside the classroom, a like-minded student snapped a picture and posted it to social media.A community member re-posted the picture, and it has since been shared several thousand times on multiple platforms.Judy says she did not  flaunt the jacket at school  and although she is liberal, would  never force her liberalism on others. Although Huffman cannot comment specifically on personnel matters, he says a full investigation will begin once spring break is over, at the end of the week:  We expect professionalism with both conduct and appearance   It seems to have caused great a bit, a great amount of concern from around the area and around the nation, as we ve received multiple phone calls today. Community reactions were mixed, on Facebook and in the neighborhood nearby the school, some expressing concern, others outrage and some saying the picture is being taken out of context and being made into a bigger deal than it is. Nobody thought it would blow up like that,  said Braxton Harless, who is a junior at the high school.  Some are upset. Some just really don t care about it. Some parents are calling for Judy s resignation, while others like Lori Selbe say she may not have made the right decision is putting on the jacket but says everyone makes mistakes.Via: wsaz",politics,"Apr 19, 2017",teacher school frump jacket classes student picture teacher spot school president twist profanity matter time jacket excuse county picture teacher media attention picture teacher classroom jacket trump patch back snapshot school teacher art teacher school picture jean jacket play president trump one photo story jacket school trump patch school patch period time jacket classroom student picture media community member picture times jacket school liberalism comment personnel investigation break end week professionalism conduct appearance bit amount concern area nation phone today community neighborhood school concern outrage picture context deal junior school care resignation decision jacket everyone
23215,"SOPA False Flag? Alleged ‘Hack’ on Netflix, Twitter, Amazon – US ready to blame Russia","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireYesterday, a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks hit some of the top online companies websites including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and Reddit. One cannot rule out the very real possibility that this a staged-managed event, especially when you consider The New York Times was listed among those affected. If recent US media and political themes are anything to go by, you can expect a cascading chorus of blame directed at Russia.In this age of America s new and improved trial by media format, you can expect a litany of unfounded accusations, along with the usual anti-Russia hyperbole and waving fingers at Washington s new go-to scapegoat   Russian president Vladimir Putin.The likelihood of Russia or any other country being involved in this heavily coordinated DDoS incident falls flat, when you consider that the US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months now, and even more conveniently during this 2016 US presidential election cycle, led by Vice President Joe Biden, and of course, the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, all blaming the Kremlin for both the DNC Leaks and the Wikileaks email dump.Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer, the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof.If Russia is going to be the scapegoat for this recent DDoS attack, then consider the following   HACK ATTACK?    Who was behind the Black Friday internet outage in America? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Immediately when the cyber attack story broke, the establishment quickly wheeled out their  experts , as CNN s chief gatekeeper Wolf Blitzer cued-up scripted questions to Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) advocate, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R, TN), Vice Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Not only is Blackburn is a staunch supporter of more draconian copyright laws (she once claimed that  Fair Use  was the same as  theft), she is also a fellow traveller on Washington s Anti-Russia bandwagon.In true propagandist fashion, Blitzer wasted no time asking her,  Do you think this be the work of a foreign government?  Blackburn immediately blamed the hack on the fact that the SOPA bill didn t pass, claiming that SOPA  would have blocked some of the bad actors ,  and went on to blame  cyber bots  (activists) for defeating the bill. From the obvious way that Washington oracle CNN had this story already cued up, it strongly indicates that the Washington was stage-managing this latest  cyber crisis.  WAITING IN THE WINGS: Tennessee  Republican Congressman Marsha Blackburn.As scapegoats go, blaming Russia is the gift that keeps on giving (and way past this Christmas). Last week, President Obama threw Hillary Clinton a campaign assist by formally accusing Russia of interfering with US elections process through Wikileaks. Suddenly, Washington had declared a Cyber War against Russia. The NY Times wrote: Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike.Despite all the White House and corporate media hype, no evidence at all has been presented by Washington that proves the Kremlin are hacking and  interfering with the US election process. Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke on matters of security and sent a telegraphed  message to Putin  through NBC s Meet the Press, just one day after Obama s own  Russian  declaration. Based on these latest developments, it s easy to see how this could have been an effort prime another back story to blame Russia for these DDoS attacks.The real question surrounding this apparent DDoS attack, should be directed at America s National Security Agency (NSA) and its bevy of contractors, many of whom are tasked with global and (illegal) domestic surveillance, through passive data collection and clandestine processing of communications. Surely they would know where this attack was originated (including in-house).Could this latest incident possibly be to further create a  climate of fear  during this, the most contentious presidential election in 40 years?Could this also be a government-coordinated cyber drill?Was this a government orchestrated false flag hack?It s no secret that the US government would like to pass a newer more potent version of 2011-2012 s  Stop Online Piracy Act otherwise known as SOPA. In fact, NextGov, reported the following in 2014: Nearly three years after a massive online protest derailed the Stop Online Piracy Act, many lawmakers are still nervous about even uttering the name  SOPA  in public.The bill, which once had broad bipartisan support and was a top priority for the entertainment industry, has become a dirty word. The backlash was a traumatic lesson for members of Congress about the danger of siding against tech companies and Internet activists, who warned the bill could break the Internet.Now, for the first time since SOPA crashed and burned in early 2012, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to work on a major update of copyright law. As lawmakers cautiously return to the issue of copyright protection, the SOPA protest looms large in their minds. Tech outlet Wired described the incident in the following manner. It s crucial to note that the internet performance management company Dyn was front and center   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement. Dyn states: This morning s attack started around 7 am ET and was aimed at Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company headquartered in New Hampshire. That first bout was resolved after about two hours; a second attack began just before noon. Dyn reported a third wave of attacks a little after 4 pm ET. In all cases, traffic to Dyn s Internet directory servers throughout the US primarily on the East Coast but later on the opposite end of the country as well was stopped by a flood of malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses disrupting the system. Late in the day, Dyn described the events as a  very sophisticated and complex attack.  Still ongoing, the situation is a definite reminder of the fragility of the web, and the power of the forces that aim to disrupt it. Regardless of who was actually behind the widespread internet attack, judging by the rhetoric and the mainstream media talking points  this has to be about the government wanting to usher in new  ISP governance  (making ISP s bent to government wishes to  kick out the bad actors  off their networks) and rights-violating security protocols. Is it also possible that social media giant Twitter and mega-consumer brands like Amazon have been used as willing guinea pigs, just like Yahoo was recently when their mailable CEO Marissa Mayer handed over the backdoor keys to Yahoo customer email account to the NSA and FBI.Are the US government determined to gain complete access and have total control over the internet?The idea isn t that far-fetched Yahoo s Marissa Mayer: sold out to the NSA.After Yahoo recently admitted to creating a virtual backdoor for US intelligence agencies to spy on everyday citizen s email accounts, the government exposed its own Orwellian ambitions: Yahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers  incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, two former employees and a third person apprised of the events said. This is a very important issue moving forward, as a dip in consumer confidence could be a crushing blow to any company s overall brand after complying with new  1984  security measures   all at the behest of the FBI, NSA, CIA and their trusted partners.Back in March, individual privacy versus global security was at the heart of the case between Apple and the FBI. Here s a telling passage from that report as it relates to this most recent internet attack: The ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy: Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11 How could it be that such propaganda could happen in America?

4348, FACT: Donald Trump’s Education Plan Would Mass-Fire Teachers And DECIMATE Pell Grants,"If Donald Trump had his way, 14 percent of American teachers would lose their jobs. While the United States already faces a critical shortage of teachers not seen since the 1990s, Trump s plan would eliminate these crucial teaching positions as well as decimating Pell grants used by millions of students every year to achieve higher education.How would he do this? Trump, appeasing to the far-right fringe of the Republican Party, has pledged to eliminate the Department of Education. For years Republicans   from Ron Paul to Rick Perry   have been pushing for the elimination of not just the DOE, but other Departments as well.A recent study from the Center of American Progress Action Fund used statistical analysis to show what would happen if the Department of Education really was done away with as Trump so wants to do. Well, the results are horrifying:The list goes on and on. The idea to eliminate the Department of Education may look good to someone who wants  less government,  but in reality it s a cold and heartless move that s being pushed by billionaire proponents of school choice, like the Koch Brothers.The Learning Policy Institute attributes the shortage of teachers due to monies and entities being slashed from districts and states (and the federal level) during the Great Recession. After slashing, schools and teachers suffered. Now Trump wants to slash the buffer zone between complete privatization of our schools and a robust public option that has greatly enriched our nation.The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan fiscal entity, said of closing the Department of Education:U.S. high school graduation rates are hitting all-time highs; dropout rates are at historical lows; college going rates are close to the highest they have ever been; and test scores across the country are improving. But the elimination of the protections and resources from the Department of Education could significantly hinder or even reverse these gains.Trump won t listen. Instead he ll pander to his rich ultra-conservative buddies who have now propped him up in this election. If Trump has his way, say goodbye to our education system.Featured image via Theo Stroomer/Getty Images ",News,"October 5, 2016",trump way percent shortage trump plan teaching pell millions year education trump fringe party department education perry elimination doe study center progress action fund analysis department education trump list idea department education someone government reality move billionaire school choice learning policy institute shortage level recession buffer zone option nation budget office non entity department education school graduation time college test country elimination department education gains pander election trump way education system image

4564, Michigan Republicans Strip Flint Of Their Power To Sue The State Over Poisoned Water,"The city of Flint, Michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state Republicans hadn t been so careless.After placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the city s drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption.As a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water.Understandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue.According to the Detroit Free Press:Though Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder.The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board.This is absolutely outrageous. It s like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her.Michigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyone s right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be.After all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",city flint michigan man disaster state flint state control money city water lake huron flint river drinking water source consumption result city lead poisoning water flint hell state court governor rick democracy justice lawsuit flint power press flint state emergency manager state control city member receivership transition board rick board flint city cannot lawsuit approval state board woman permission lawsuit company power anyone redress court system case water cover city flint state court power flint city way image mark

16555,NOT KIDDING! HILLARY’S State Department Blocked Investigation Into Muslim Terrorist’s Florida Mosque Because “It Unfairly Targeted Muslims”,"Nothing to see here. Hillary was likely just fulfilling a promise to a foreign Muslim donor. It wasn t the first time she gave a  stand down  order and if the Democrat party can help it, it won t be the last Hillary Clinton s State Dept. shut down an investigation into the mosque Orlando killer Omar Mir Siddique Mateen attended because it  unfairly singled out Muslims. The Fort Pierce Islamic Center, where Mateen worshipped several times a week, was under investigation by both the FBI and DHS as early as 2011 for ties to a worldwide Islamic movement known as Tablighi Jamaal which was linked to several terrorist organizations.But the investigation was shut down under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims, according to recently retired DHS agent Philip Haney. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday.In other words, the FBI had limited options at stopping Mateen because it was ordered to back off its investigation into his mosque.Both Clinton and the Obama administration have a history of enabling Islamic terrorism.In 2012, Clinton s State Dept. was backing al-Qaeda in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS, and other Islamic extremist groups as a proxy army to topple Syrian President Bashir al-Assad. The Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria,  a leaked memo between her State Dept. and the Pentagon stated.  The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support [this] opposition, while Russia, China and Iran  support the [Assad] regime. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday. This secret document confirms that Clinton s State Dept.   and the Obama administration in general   were directly responsible for the rise of ISIS, which is now targeting the West. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, confirmed the document s importance.  I don t know that [the Obama administration] turned a blind eye [to ISIS], I think it was a decision; I think it was a willful decision,  he said.Clinton even admitted some responsibility. The United States had   to be fair   we had helped create the problem we re now fighting,  she said in an interview with Fox anchor Greta Van Susteren.

Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes. It then continues with a scene illustrated by Brewer Lane about a 1990 pool party at Trump s Florida beach club. He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn t intended to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit. But Brewer Lane disputed the way she is portrayed Monday in an interview with Fox & Friends. The New York Times told us several times that they would make sure my story that I was telling came across, they promised several times that they would do it accurately, they told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly and it absolutely was not,  Brewer Lane said.  They did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation on it. They spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump. Brewer Lane dated Trump and said that the presumptive Republican nominee  never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way, he never offended me in any way. WATCH HERE:  Obviously they feel like they need to do something to make him look bad or go along with their article,  Brewer Lane said. Why do you think the left   the mainstream media   is so obsessed with just creating this headline about how Donald Trump treats women?  host Ainsley Earhardt asked. I don t know. I think that they re just reaching for straws,  Brewer Lane said, adding that her manager has reached out to the reporter to say they would be telling her side of the story. Via: USA TodayHere is Trump s reply to the New York Times  hit piece :Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016Trump also replied to Brewer on Twitter, thanking her for letting the public know the truth, and about how the NYT s twisted her:That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends   I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!

18112,TRUMP’S DOJ MAKES Announcement on Anti-Gun Obama-Era “Operation Choke Point”,"The program is dead! Operation Choke Point is no longer a huge nuisance to gun dealers. Republican leaders like Bob Goodlatte made it clear to the Trump administration s DOJ that they wanted this program to end ASAP.Eric Holder launched the program when he was attorney general. The program was a thorn in the side of gun dealers because it hurt a gun dealer s ability to receive financial services from banks.One statement from the DOJ stands out:  Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor. HUH? SHOULDN T IT GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE DOJ SHOULDN T TARGET CERTAIN BUSINESSES??? WHAT IN THE WORLD!GOP lawmakers wrote:  Operation Choke Point was an Obama Administration initiative that destroyed legitimate businesses to which that Administration was ideologically opposed (e.g., firearms dealers) by intimidating financial institutions into denying banking services to those businesses. TRUNP DOJ ENDS HOLDER PROGRAM HINDERING GUN DEALERSThe Trump Justice Department is ending an Obama-era program that had attempted to cut off credit to shady businesses but came under fire from Republicans for unfairly targeting gun dealers and other legitimate operations.Just days after top House Republicans had pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to shutter Operation Choke Point, the department confirmed in a response letter that the program is dead. All of the Department s bank investigations conducted as part of Operation Chokepoint are now over, the initiative is no longer in effect, and it will not be undertaken again,  Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said in the Aug. 16-dated letter, calling it a  misguided initiative  from the prior administration.Read more: Fox News",left-news,"Aug 18, 2017",program operation point nuisance bob trump administration program holder program attorney program thorn side gun gun dealer ability statement law operating industry administration target world operation point administration initiative administration banking program gun trump justice department era program credit fire gun days house attorney jeff sessions operation choke department response letter program department bank part operation initiative effect attorney letter initiative administration news
15645,FRIDAY DOCUMENT DUMP: 300 CLINTON E-MAILS RELEASED,"The Friday document dump today included 300 of the thousands of yet to be released Clinton e-mails. How convenient to release these on a holiday weekend. We re all being scammed in all this because these are the e-mails hand picked by Hillaries minions. We won t get to the truth because it was destroyed. This entire thing is smelling to high heaven The State Department released its first round of emails from Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State on Friday, offering a new look at her handling of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.The roughly 300 emails, about 850 pages, are part of the 30,000 that she turned over to State from her private email server, which she used almost exclusively to conduct both private and public business during her time at State. They reveal a range of correspondence from Clinton, everything from policy briefs to scheduling requests to friendly exchanges with staff.White House press secretary Josh Earnest says the new emails  do not change in any way anyone s understanding  of what happened in Benghazi, and the State Department reiterated the same in a tweet. The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks,  the department tweeted.Clinton herself commented on the release at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Friday, telling reporters she was happy they were out but was waiting for more. It s beginning. I just would like to see it expedited, so we could get more of them out more quickly,  she said.Below, a collection of some of the most newsworthy tidbits from the emails:A supportive boss In one email, sent four days before Christmas in 2012, Clinton sent a note to her entire State Department staff, acknowledging a  challenging week.  She had fainted about a week prior and suffered a concussion, which prevented her from testifying before House and Senate committees on the attacks. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi and make every possible improvement   and we will,  she wrote in the five-paragraph note.One day earlier, Clinton wrote in an email to two top aides headed to the Hill on her behalf:  I ll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you  remain calm and carry on!' One of those aides, Tom Nides, hints that he s not entirely excited about the grilling.Clinton replies:  Well, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you ll have triumphed! In most emails, she s referred to simply as  H. Stress over Benghazi scrutiny One email hints at the scrutiny the State Department was facing over Clinton s response to the Benghazi attacks. In their remarks the day after the attack, both Clinton and President Barack Obama made reference to an anti-Muslim video that some intelligence initially suggested prompted the attacks, a claim that was later found to be mistaken.On Sept. 24, 2012, Jake Sullivan, Clinton s deputy chief of staff at State, forwards her a 24-page document compiling all of the statements she had made after the attacks, and reassures her that she was careful in her wording. You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method,  he says.Sullivan also writes:  The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis. Advice on foreign affairs Clinton received advice on foreign affairs from a range of former advisers from outside of the department, including Sidney Blumenthal, the former Clinton White House aide who s drawn scrutiny for issuing over two dozen memos to Clinton on Libya while also advising businesses looking to break into post-Gaddafi Libya.The emails reveal that Clinton often read, commented on and forwarded Blumenthal s memos   which laid out information obtained from his own sources on the situation in Libya   to Sullivan. Blumenthal will comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi this week after his role in advising Clinton emerged.In a September 2012 email, Burns Strider, a senior adviser and director of Faith and Values Outreach on Clinton s 2008 campaign, forwards her a post from CNN s Belief blog by Stephen Prothero titled  My Take: A deadly link between Islamic and anti-Islamic terrorists.  She typically forwards these to State Department aides.Libya security concerns In the years leading up to the attack covered by the emails, there were a number of hints at the decaying security situation in Libya   key sticking point for Republican critics of Clinton s performance at State. Many believe she ignored warnings that the security there was declining and showed poor judgment in failing to beef up protection for U.S. officials there.In June of 2011, Sullivan emailed Hillary warning of a  credible threat against the hotel that our team is using,  and told her security officials would be moving personnel to other locations.She received an update in 2011 from Stevens on how fragile the security forces were in the country. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation, Another email, sent in February of 2012 by then Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, warned of  concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. Congratulations and condolences on Benghazi In the days following the attacks, Clinton received a stream of condolences and congratulations from diplomats, lawmakers and world leaders on her handling of the situation.On Sept. 13, Clinton is forwarded an email from U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, who says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him to offer  profound condolences  about the Benghazi attack.  He said Israelis know too well how difficult these moments are, and he wanted us all to know that Israelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us at such a difficult time,  Shapiro writes.Christian Brose, Sen. John McCain s national security adviser, emailed Sullivan on Sept. 12, 2012, the day Clinton gave a speech honoring those who died in the attacks, sending his boss s compliments.  What a wonderful, strong and moving statement by your boss. Please tell her how much Sen. McCain appreciated it. Me too,  he wrote.Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also sent his condolences.Intelligence holes? One October 2012 email underscores the limits of U.S. intelligence. Clinton emailed senior aide Cheryl Mills asking about an NPR report on the attacks. I just heard an NPR report about the CIA station chief in Tripoli sending a cable on 9/12 saying there was no demo etc.,  she wrote.  Do you know about this? Thoughts on the media A transcript of an interview with Wall Street Journal Reporter Monica Langley was circulated among a few top aides with commentary from Philippe Reines, a longtime spokesman for Clinton.He declared the October 10, 2012, conversation as an  awesome interview.  But he went on to say that Langley violated Clinton s personal space, by moving her chair knee-to-knee with the secretary, comparing it to  the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on which tooth she was trying to get access to. I ve never seen a westerner invade her space like that,  Reines wrote. But he went on to describe the interview as  wonderful. One of the best interviews I ve ever witnesses. Wish it were on live TV.

3587, China Fires Warning At Trump For Contacting Taiwan In Violation Of One-China Policy,"Donald Trump has not even taken office yet and he has already pissed off the most populous nation on the planet.For nearly 40 years, the United States and made it policy that the American president does not contact the leader of Taiwan for the sake of stable relations with China.But Donald Trump violated that policy on Friday by talking to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation and considers the island its territory. This goes all the way back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek evacuated his Nationalist forces to Taiwan after being defeated by Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War.China has refused to recognize Taiwan ever since and considers it a renegade territory.Trump claims that the phone call was merely congratulatory and that both sides expressed that  close economic, political and security ties exist between Taiwan and the United States. But if you believe that, I have a golden tower to sell you. Most likely, Trump is getting cozy with Taiwan because his company wants to build luxury hotels and resorts on the island, which is yet another conflict of interest Trump has refused to deal with and is more proof that Trump only wants to use the presidency for his own selfish financial gain.Trump s action has been criticized by diplomats and state department personnel. And his recklessness has now drawn an angry response from the Chinese government.In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry lodged a formal protest and warned Trump to beware of risking relations between our two nations again.  It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  Chinese officials said.  We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the  one China  policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship. Again, Trump has not even taken office yet and he is already screwing up decades worth of established foreign policy, proving once again that he is too irresponsible to be president.China is a major holder of U.S. foreign debt and is a major manufacturer of products sold by American businesses. So pissing the Chinese off could not only lead to a war, it could substantially cripple our economy.Donald Trump serious needs to read the relevant intelligence and foreign policy briefings so he doesn t do anything stupid like this again.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 3, 2016",trump office nation planet policy president leader sake china trump policy president china nation island territory way nationalist war china territory trump phone call sides security tower trump cozy company luxury island conflict interest trump presidency gain trump action state department personnel recklessness response government statement ministry protest trump china world side china policy abide china interference china relationship trump office policy president china holder debt manufacturer war economy needs intelligence policy anything image
14191,TOP TEN Most “Ethically Challenged” Clinton E-mails,"The party s over or is it? Hillary Clinton and her aides will need to decide whether to lie or tell the truth to the FBI about her e-mail and official business. This puts them in a position of choosing between being honest about those emails, or lying to the FBI, which is a crime,  said Matthew G. Whitaker, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 to 2009. He is presently executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) in Washington, D.C.Federal agents are preparing to schedule interviews with Clinton s  longtime and closest aides  about her use of the private email and server throughout her tenure as the nation s chief diplomat from 2009 to 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Despite Clinton s repeated denial she ever sent or received classified information via her private email, federal investigators said more than 2,000 of the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the Department of State did include classified material. More than 20 of those emails contained information so sensitive and classified members of Congress were not allowed to read them.Whitaker s group made public its list of what it judges to be the  top 10 most ethically challenged Hillary emails  March 10, 2016:Nepotism: Clinton intervened Aug. 22, 2012, on behalf of her son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, in an effort to secure State Department assistance for one of his business associates with ties to a Clinton Foundation donor. FACT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on this issue. Favoring Insiders: Clinton  impressed  billionaire donor George Soros with his easy access to her, according to a May 12, 2012, email to her from Neera Tanden, veteran Clinton adviser and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. Above The Law: Clinton told aide Jake Sullivan in a June 17, 2011, email to disregard classification security regulations and send information for a speech via a non-secure email system, which forced the aide to either break the law or disobey an order. Special Interests: In a July 26, 2010, email exchange with Clinton, Sullivan forwarded a message from Jeffrey Farrow, an influential lobbyist for a Pacific island government. The exchange  raises red flags about whether Farrow had made  requests,  according to FACT. Selling Access: A Dec. 10, 2009, email discussed attempts by Clinton campaign and foundation donor Brian Greenspun to set up a meeting between Clinton and a top Israeli official who had  been trying to meet with [Clinton] to no avail.  The email suggests certain campaign and foundation donors had a privileged  back door  to Clinton. Conflicts Of Interest: Clinton pushed for the State Department to work with the Clinton Foundation and the Red Cross on a project in Haiti. The Jan. 19, 2010, email from Clinton to Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills indicates a clear conflict of interest, according to FACT. Helping Political Allies: Mark Penn, Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign pollster and long-time political adviser, complained about not having timely access on a corporate event in China. His complaints were apparently resolved after a Feb. 22, 2010, email from Clinton aide Kris Balderston that set up a telephone call with Clinton. Trading Favors: Barely a week after the Penn complaint, Balderston reported in a March 2 email to Clinton that major corporations, including Boeing, CITI and Blackstone, agreed to provide financial support for the event.  Even the appearance of this sort of favor trading, involving the public, private and political sectors, is a bad ethics practice,  according to FACT. Abuse Of Position: A Sept. 15, 2011, email forwarded to Clinton, Sullivan and aide Huma Abedin listed multiple State Department officials attending the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative conference despite having  no official role.  Robert Hormats, a department official, was also a speaker at a dinner co-hosted by the Goldman Sachs Wall Street investment firm that later paid Clinton $675,000 for three speeches. The dinner focused on investing in women, Clinton s favorite Clinton Foundation project. Duping Obama: In a Sept. 20, 2011, email to Clinton, Mills forwarded a draft of President Barack Obama s planned remarks to the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative. FACT contends that  Clinton doesn t appear to have routinely received copies of the President s draft speeches, and it sends bad ethical signals to treat a speech given to her family s organization differently.

22652,Blood Sport: GOP Presidential Race Takes Another Brutal Turn As ‘Party Favorites’ Tear Into Trump,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAs Baron Rothschild famously said back in the late 18th century,  When there s blood in the streets, it s time to buy property.  Too bad then that Donald Trump has to divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust. On the scale of ugly, last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards.Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz began their two hour-long sustained attack on the man in the middle, Donald Trump   relentlessly hitting the front-runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle. Trump hit back at Cruz calling him  a liar  and at Rubio calling the Florida Senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of Chris Christie during the last televised debate. WAR: GOP rival Marco Rubio tearing into Donald Trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals.Clearly, CNN was also part of this coordinated attack, as they echoed Wall Street luminary and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, going after Trump about publicly releasing his tax returns. Trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the IRS and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit (which is actually true), and CNN, along with Cruz, kept hammering the issue straight into the post-debate media opportunity where CNN ing nue Chris Cuomo tried (and failed) to channel his inner Tim Russert as he continued the Trump tax probe.It didn t end there. Subsequent gang stalking by Rubio and Cruz were powered by the New York Times (who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti-Trump editorial stance early on), including accusations of fraud over the Trump University civil court case, Trump using Polish building labor in 1980 (the same year that Rubio and Cruz were beginning second grade), and accusations of hypocrisy over Trump s use of used H-2B Visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south Florida (that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though. Trump, a seasoned litigator, didn t seemed too worried about the Trump University case, intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that , and the Polish builder scandal (come on guys, who doesn t like Polish builders?) happened 36 years ago.Forget about airs and graces. This was a vicious battle   a historic new low for American politics. The fact Trump survived the beating was something in itself. If he does make it through this storm, then both Cruz and Rubio will have done The Donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage, and leaving Hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come August.When today s morning press came out, exactly as they have throughout this election, all of the mainstream media channels, newspapers and magazine loudly declared Trump s  debate defeat , and trumpeted Rubio  aggressiveness . Liberal establishment stalwart The Atlantic declared,  Trump s Terrible night , while NBC News ran with the headline that  Rubio and Cruz Hammer Trump , followed by the Washington Post trumpeting,  Rubio Won Debate, Put Trump on the Defensive. Other wishful pundits weighed in, like media mogul Glenn Beck (who is openly backing Ted Cruz and warning his audiences of an end times Armageddon if America doesn t elect a  true Christian Conservative  in November). Beck was ecstatic after Rubio s debate performance, especially after this week when Trump gatecrashed a Nevada event where Beck was stumping for Cruz.Rubio is killing it.#gopdebate  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) February 26, 2016This morning, Rubio drew additional fire from the Trump CENTCOM after Rubio claimed that Donald Trump had received $200 million from his father, and said if not for his father s  inheritance , Trump would be  selling watches in Manhattan. This morning Rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into Trump, calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart Trump s spelling mistakes on Twitter. At this point, you just got the feeling that Rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse. As the old saying goes: never wrestle with a pig.In the end, it was Trump who stole the wind from Rubio s sails, when early the following morning he appeared on national TV next to firebrand GOP candidate, Chris Christie, garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular New Jersey governor. RENT-A-CROWD? Critics have pointed out that Rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera, as seen at this morning s Rubio rally in Texas.Crowds For Hire?With so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media, politicians are said to be turning to PR agencies and  rent-a-crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences. More than any other previous presidential election cycle, this 2016 race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at GOP candidates like Jeb Bush   but also towards Marco Rubio. At this morning s media event, Rubio s team had hand-picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below Rubio. Interestingly, the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and Rubio   they simply smile, and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in Texas. Even hip hop gangster-looking students wearing color-coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote, appear disinterested, as if they are being paid $40 to stand in a row in the camera frame.If this is any indication of Rubio s  New American Century , then it s certainly cause for worry. The fact that Rubio stole his campaign slogan from Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton s neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) is interesting, and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect.Ironically, it was the brash hawk Donald Trump who took the high ground on the issue of the Middle East. When asked about his commitment to Israel, Trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that,  It would be my greatest achievement as US president.  Who can really argue with that? Well, hermanos Cubanos did. Cruz and Rubio were furious at this point, and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the Israeli Lobby to maintain a categorically anti-Palestinian stance. Cruz and Rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange, both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the Middle East on their watch. Once again, Cruz and Rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want.Almost one year ago I said on the SUNDAY WIRE SHOW that the Republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the White House more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that with Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, could somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008 and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young (44 years old, although you d punt him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly he s Latino, which gives the GOP a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump.CurtainsIf Cruz loses his home state Texas GOP primary on March 1st, then it s lights out for the Cruz campaign. Right now Cruz and Trump are in a dead heat, nearly tied in the pre-polling, with Cruz a few points ahead. Ditto for Rubio in his home state Florida s GOP primary on March 15th. Currently, Trump is burying Rubio by an average of 15+ points in every poll for Florida. Birther issues aside, this has always been the knock against both Rafael Edward  Ted  Cruz (photo, left) and Marco Rubio: just like Barack Obama, they are too young and with no real experience governing, and like Obama, destined to become party functionaries.Trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in Manhattan, both Cruz and Rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high. Putting this into perspective, it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring America . Like him or hate him, Trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships, and has actually created jobs. As much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation , the truth is that Americans no longer believe this lie, and millions now see Donald J. Trump as the antidote to that institutional fib. If you polled Americans today and asked them: would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy (?), it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything. Trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him, it s not a theoretical proposition. In essence this is the American Dream, and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians Rubio and Cruz, and perhaps for Hillary Clinton too, should she face-off against Trump later on.Despite the mainstream media insistence that Marco Rubio  won  Thursday night s debate, and  Ted Cruz looked  strong , it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes, in effect, trying to out-Trump The Donald. If that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super Tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over-inflated political marketing exercises. Their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers, but in the end it didn t make the Cuban pair look presidential. At this stage of the race, looking presidential is important, but when you re desperately playing catch-up you simply can t afford to look presidential, according to Rubio and Cruz anyway. Just another example of how short-term logic rules this race.Meanwhile, the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic (think of all the retractions and back pedaling if Trump wins) as Trump continues to win primaries and scoop-up delegates on his way towards a Republican nomination.Watch Rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in Texas:   It was amusing to watch CNN interrogators, along with Rubio and Cruz, lay into Trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan. Trump stuck to his canned lines, and generalities, and lost no ground with his supporters either. It should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either, as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises. Eight years of Obama taught America that lesson once and for all.Throughout the CNN event, Trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry. The fact of the matter here is, despite painting themselves as rebels and  DC outsiders , both Rubio and Cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various Washington DC lobbies. The same special interests have poured fortunes into Super PACs which are presently funding Cruz and Rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar TV ad slots. Trump, on the other hand, is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for.Collectively, between Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated, invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated GOP field   and give lift-off to each one of these political balloons. As it stands now, all of this money will have been spent in vain. The only winners will be the media consultants and PR companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material, and also the TV networks, like CNN, FOX and the others, who ran all of those costly political ads.Towards the end of CNN s gladiatorial event last night, Trump got the last word, and again, it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base. He exclaimed: Politicians are all talk, no action   just like these two here (Cruz and Rubio)  Look what s happening to our country. Trade, vets, common core, Obamacare: I ll get it done, they won t, and we will Make America Great Again. Once again, it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says, or like everything he does. Just as Jimmy Carter was to cure for Nixon s epic corruption, and the Simple Jack approach of George W. Bush was the beneficiary of Bill Clinton s shameful antics in the Oval office, and just as Barack Obama was the natural reaction to the nation s WMD shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of George W. Bush   so too is Donald Trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer-in-chief politics by Barack Obama.If Trump does win the nomination in July, then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in American history.

22011,Trump Springs the Neocon Trap  Again: North Korea’s ‘Test’ is No Act of War,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireHere we go again. There seems to be no end to the escalation of tensions between North Korea and the United States and its allies.Yesterday, Pyongyang s state broadcaster came out declaring what it claims is another  successful test , this time with a hydrogen bomb, which they say could be mounted on to their still as yet nonexistent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Seizing the moment, state news anchor Ri Chun Hee proudly announced that the test was a  perfect success,  and symbolises the country s final step on the long road to attaining a  state nuclear force.  All very exciting.Still, there has been no independent verification of the claim, but why let that get in the way of a promising international security crisis? Kim Jung Un: Looking at shiny objects, pointing, generally looking busy.  North Korea s alleged  test  is said to have happened just hours after Pyongyang state-run media released images of leader Kim Jong Un  inspecting  (looking, pointing) something which looks like it could be a hydrogen bomb, but no one is really sure.We re also told that this was  ready to be placed on top of an ICBM,  however no one has actually seen a real operational ICBM yet. That s kind of an important detail in this grand plot, but one which is routinely overlooked by legions of western mainstream  experts  on CNN and NBC. So far, the DPRK only has a series of botched tests of their short-range Hwasong-12 rockets (glorified Scud missiles) to show the world. Still, the western media insist that this constitutes a potential threat to the US.So confident was this mainstream media outlet, that they ve seemed to have hedged their bets on the authenticity of the DPRK state claims, leaving the offending  H Bomb  in quotes SEE ALSO: North Korea and The Unintended Consequences of TrumpThis wouldn t be the first time North Korea exaggerated its WMD credentials. Last January they exaggerated claims of a successful  H-bomb  test. Despite their dodgy record, the western media, and politicians who are fed by defense contracts   are lapping up Pyongyang s latest pig s breakfast.Whatever this latest test was, it s hardly an act of war. Meanwhile, South Korea wasted no time retaliating by showing off its new toys purchased out of its US dollar reserve account, launching multiple missiles for the cameras. Seoul insists that it s ready to activate four Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile batteries. It also carried out a major joint drill (likely pre-planned anyway) with F-15K fighter jets and surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. This posturing by South Korea has excited the western media to no end. Everyone is loving it, because nothing brings eye balls and ratings like a good crisis.Guardian reporter Justin McCurry confirms: South Korea has carried out a simulated attack on North Korea s nuclear test site in a huge show of force in response to Pyongyang s detonation of what it claims is a hydrogen bomb.Seoul has also approved the complete deployment of a US anti-missile system in another sign that it intends to address North Korean provocations with reminders of its own military firepower, while keeping the door open to dialogue. You can be certain that CNN absolutely loves this latest  crisis  too, wailing this morning: South Korea strengthened the deployment of a controversial US-made missile defense system and launched a huge show of military might on Monday in response to North Korea s hydrogen bomb test. Naturally, not a word of condemnation from the western media about South Korea s real provocations   broadcast in colour around the world.How Serious is the Threat?At the time of publishing this piece, members of the UN Security Council are already convening emergency sessions about what to do next. In the final analysis, there will have to be some clear and present threat in order to justify some harsh response from the UNSC.Can such a rational evaluation be made with so much theatre on both sides?Washington s UN Ambassador Nikki Haley gave a predictable hawkish speech claiming that,  He is begging for war.  Of course Haley is all too eager to oblige.Once again, western media outlets are treating claims by North Korea s state-run KCNA media agency as  good as gold  (ratings gold, that is).For the US, this latest move by North Korea has been PR gold. It s helped to revive and reenergize the dying conversation of a nuclear standoff between  The Good Guys  and  The Bad Guys. And to deal with those bad guys, you need tough guys.Enter US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who swiftly moved in with  tough new sanctions  against the DPRK, warning that  this isn t the time for just talk.  A novel approach.Eager to win back some approval points and stop the political hemorrhaging that seems to be draining all of the mojo Trump had when he whipped-up the campaign trail crowds promising to  drain the swamp,  the President took to Twitter, to do what he thinks his base wants, which is to be Kim s  bad cop .Kim and The Donald, two iconic frontmen, both being played like a marionette by  the generals  off camera.Cue Trump North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States,  wrote Trump.Tough. North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success. South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing! Tougher.Trump also tries to slam the door shut on any chance of bilateral negotiations:South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017Toughest.Of course, Trump s comments appear to be winding up Pyongyang. A vicious circle of fighting talk. Are there any adults left in the room?Not to be outdone, here comes a  good cop.  Enter US Defense Secretary James  Mad Dog  Mattis, who is still earning his nickname meant to resemble an unstable, rabid house pet. After his meeting with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday, the Mad Dog, wearing a purple tie (the same colour as Hillary s revolution), read his military decree on the White House lawn: We have many military options, and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them. We made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies, South Korea and Japan, from any attack, and our commitments among the allies are ironclad,  said Mattis.What a relief, he sounds moderate compared to Trump. But wait Before exiting the podium, he said:  We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said, we have many options to do so. This is a unique breed of lunatic.Talking tough, and talking of  options  for  annihilating  a country. Normal people would say this is an idiotic proposition because the fall-out would be much worse than any of Kim apocalyptic sabre rattling. All this looks very familiar. Quite simply, what we are seeing here in Washington is Neoconservativism reasserting itself through one of its flagship planks   the preemptive strike. Above all other military strategies, this is always the most favorable for the Pentagon because it doesn t require any real justification or accountability for a preemptive action. All that s required is a sufficient amount of media fear-mongering and political hype about  the threat we all face  and how  we must act    and then simply fire away and sift through the rubble, reforming the narrative afterwards. In the meantime, the ruling parties can call it a success, and claim that  many lives were saved by this valiant action  etc. It s clean and straightforward, albeit in the short term, but extremely messy in the long term.As much as hawks in Washington would love to test out their new toys right now, a conflagration is not likely to happen by the hand of the US in the Pacific Rim. There are too many powerful players in the immediate vicinity (South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Philippines  and Russia, too) and the fall-out from any rash US-led geopolitical pissing contest,  surgical  or kinetic action could be detrimental to all parties. Better to get someone else to start it for them, but that s not easy either.There was a time when people had high hopes for Mattis. He was affectionately referred to as the  warrior monk,  with many FOX News pundits drooling over his apparent Sun Tzu prowess, as was rumoured that he has actually read some historical books and was  really smart  and  really wise    apparently a rarity in Washington military circles these days. But no matter how many books people think he s read about the Peloponnesian Wars, it s should be pretty clear by now that Mattis, like his predecessor Ash Carter, is acting as kind of an executive sales rep for the military industrial complex. That s essentially what the position of Defense Secretary has become in America. It s a straightforward deal: you ll keep your job, as long as you do and say what s required to keep international tensions high at all times. This translates into profits, and shareholder dividends for industry stakeholders. If you re not with the program, then you ll have to tender your resignation. Just ask Chuck Hagel.What Americans should really understand is that  the generals  with whom Trump is so enamored, and who he trusts with all our bombs and silos   have left nothing but a string of military failures in their wake. Between Generals James Mattis and Major General H.R. McMaster, you have a collective 30 plus years and two of the worst military and foreign policy boondoggles in US history, Afghanistan and Iraq, underscored by successive failed  surges.  Add to these, a total defeat in Syria, blowing billions of US taxpayer dollars on a proxy war that s arguably created a new generation of Islamist extremists (although no one will admit it). Impressive, isn t it? So why do the media continue to elevate the military brass? Not every General is a good general. As with any other position or profession, some are good, and some are corrupt, and many are incompetent, or promoted for playing ball. General David Petraeus  is a good example of this. The media can t get enough of him. He was  the architect of the surge  we re told, which means he was around when Obama-Bush ordered up another 30,000 troops for Iraq in a futile effort to fix what they broke. Still, the media will bend over backwards in an almost worshipful mode whenever his name is mentioned, forgetting that Petraeus was found guilty of the same crime for which half of America wanted Hillary Clinton locked-up. Despite bringing his name and his office into disrepute, Petraeus  was rewarded board positions with mega Wall Street firms like KKR, and a perennial seat at Bilderberg.Men like Mattis, McMaster and Petraeus can, and will run rings around this President who has already signaled his weakness for those chevrons on the shoulder. And,this President will happily defer everything to these men. Should we be surprised if they keep getting it wrong?Let s just pray that they don t get it wrong with North Korea, too.*** Patrick Henningsen is an American-born writer and global affairs analyst and founder of independent news and analysis site 21st Century Wire and host of the SUNDAY WIRE weekly radio show broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR).READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"September 4, 2017",century end allies yesterday state broadcaster test time hydrogen bomb missile moment state news anchor chun test success country step road state force verification claim way security crisis kim test state media leader kim something hydrogen bomb one top one kind detail plot series range world media threat media outlet authenticity state bomb time bomb dodgy record media defense pig breakfast test act war time dollar reserve account altitude area defense missile joint fighter surface media end everyone nothing eye crisis reporter attack test site show force response detonation hydrogen bomb deployment missile system sign firepower door crisis morning deployment missile defense system show response hydrogen bomb test word condemnation media colour world threat time piece security council emergency sessions analysis threat order response evaluation sides ambassador speech war course media state run media agency gold move gold conversation standoff treasury secretary warning time approach eager approval mojo trump campaign trail swamp president base cop kim marionette camera cue north rogue nation threat embarrassment success south talk appeasement thing trump door shut chance talk appeasement thing course trump circle talk room cop defense secretary nickname rabid house pet meeting president trump vice president pence mad dog tie colour revolution decree house lawn president ability allies japan attack allies relief podium annihilation country breed country people proposition fall kim flagship strike pentagon justification accountability action amount media threat face afterwards ruling success claim action albeit term term conflagration hand pacific rim vicinity south japan china fall rash contest action someone time people monk news sun prowess rarity days matter people predecessor ash carter kind rep complex position defense secretary deal job times shareholder industry program resignation chuck trump nothing string wake policy history defeat war generation one media brass general position profession example media architect surge bush effort media backwards mode name crime half name office disrepute board street seat men president weakness shoulder president everything men pray born writer analyst founder news analysis site century wire host radio show broadcast radio network news century wire work member
3405, A Former CIA Chief Just Said Trump Will Be Held Responsible For New Terror Attacks (DETAILS),"Just a few days ago, President-elect Donald Trump concerned Americans around the country when he stated that he didn t have to receive regular intelligence briefings more than once per week because he was  like, a smart person.  That s right   Trump only gets briefings once per week, and his Vice President Mike Pence gets these briefings six times per week.These briefings are so important that President Barack Obama, who has been running the country for eight years, still gets updated on a daily basis. So having someone as unqualified and stupid as Trump turn these briefings down is really terrifying.On Wednesday, former CIA director Leon Panetta pointed out the consequences of such ignorance when he stated that Trump could be held responsible for any future terror attack if he continued to refuse more regular briefings. Panetta said that Trump s resistance to knowing what is going on in the world beyond Twitter  can t last : I ve seen presidents who have asked questions about whether that intelligence is verifiable, what are the sources for that intelligence, but I have never seen a president who said,  I don t want that stuff.' If we endure another attack and the intelligence officials had indications or information regarding that attack and the president did not want to listen to that, for whatever reason, the responsibility for that attack would fall on the president. To refresh, Trump s reason for not receiving more frequent briefings   which he confidently broadcasted on Fox News over the weekend   was that they were repetitive and that he already knew about potential threats. Trump said in a fit of pure ignorance: You know, I m a smart person. I don t have to be told the same things in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Panetta (and the rest of America, pretty much) disagrees. The ex-CIA chief also advised that Trump should get on board with what the U.S. intelligence agencies are reporting regarding Russia s interference in the U.S. election   a claim that Trump has denied and called  ridiculous . Panetta said: When it comes to Russian interference in our last campaign, 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia is involved in that effort. I think the President would do well to say we ought to find out what Russia s role was, we ought to investigate it and ensure that it never happens again. If Trump is to increase the amount of briefings he gets, it s going to be because he s forced to   not because he thinks he actually needs them. Trump is incapable of coming to terms with his excruciatingly obvious shortcomings, and it s going to backfire tremendously on America and its people.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"December 14, 2016",days president elect trump country intelligence week person trump week vice president pence times week president country basis someone trump director ignorance trump terror attack trump resistance world twitter intelligence intelligence president stuff attack intelligence information attack president reason responsibility attack president trump reason news weekend fit ignorance person day rest ex chief trump board intelligence russia interference election claim trump interference campaign intelligence russia effort president role trump amount trump people image blanco
15763,BREAKING: LEFTIST DEMOCRAT MAYOR ORDERED BALTIMORE POLICE TO STAND DOWN [Video],"A source involved in the enforcement efforts confirmed there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief, as riots broke out on Monday night to stand down.Despite a firm denial by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a senior law enforcement source charges that she gave an order for police to stand down as riots broke out Monday night, raising more questions about whether some of the violence and looting could have been prevented.The source, who is involved in the enforcement efforts, confirmed to Fox News there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief Monday night, effectively tying the hands of officers as they were pelted with rocks and bottles.Asked directly if the mayor was the one who gave that order, the source said:  You are God damn right it was. The claim follows criticism of the mayor for, over the weekend, saying they were giving space to those who  wished to destroy. By Tuesday night, despite the chaos a day earlier, Baltimore police along with the National Guard and other law enforcement contingents seemed to be restoring order in the city, which was under a curfew overnight.Rawlings-Blake has defended her handling of the unrest, which grew out of protests over the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody.The mayor, in an interview with Fox News  Bill Hemmer on Tuesday, denied any order was issued to hold back on Monday. You have to understand, it is not holding back. It is responding appropriately,  she said, saying there was no stand-down directive.She said her critics have a right to their opinion.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday suggested the mayor also waited too long to request a state of emergency.That followed criticism over her remarks over the weekend, when she said it s important to give protesters the opportunity to exercise their right to free speech.She seemed to take that notion a step further:  It s a very delicate balancing act, because, while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. As her  destroy  remarks faced a buzzsaw of criticism amid the riots Monday, the mayor initially tried to deny she said them. I never said nor would I ever say that we are giving people space to destroy our city, so my words should not be twisted,  the mayor said Monday.In a press conference, she accused critics of a  blatant mischaracterization. But her office eventually released a written statement acknowledging she said those words   while attempting to explain them.Via: FOX News",politics,"Apr 29, 2015",source enforcement order mayor police chief night denial mayor law enforcement source order police night violence source enforcement news order mayor police chief night mayor one order source claim criticism mayor weekend space night chaos day police guard law enforcement order city curfew blake handling death police custody mayor interview news bill hemmer order stand directive right opinion hogan mayor state emergency criticism weekend opportunity right speech notion step balancing act space destroy criticism mayor people space city mayor press conference mischaracterization office statement fox news
23312,US Media Hyped ‘Active Shooter’ Drill at Andrews Base As Real Event,"21st Century Wire says Yesterday, we were told by US media that one of the country s key military installations, Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home of the president s Air Force One airliner, was in lockdown following reports of an  Active Shooter  situation.While the entire US media went into orange alert mode for over 2 and a half hours, 21WIRE recognized exactly what it was, a drill, and called it correctly while the news was breaking. We re told that initial reports of a  active shooter  were prompted by an emergency 911 call to outside law enforcement about a gunman seen on the base. The fact that this alleged  distress call  came from a  staff member  at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located inside Andrews (one of the country s most secure closed military facilities) should have raised some pertinent questions   like why base security were not informed first, as one would expect. Furthermore, any reports by the US mainstream media characterizing the event as a genuine  active shooter  crisis should have been immediately squashed by the fact that Joint Base Andrews was also running a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am that morning. Sadly, this did not happen, and all US media outlets began their crisis reporting   complete with the usual panel of security  experts  and  justice correspondents on CNN and other mainstream networks.21WIRE Calls it CorrectlyWhile the US media was reporting the base was in full lockdown and appeared  confused  about what to make of the situation, 21WIRE analyst Patrick Henningsen appeared on RT International while the story was breaking, offering a very different take on the event than what was being reported at the time throughout the US media. Here s what he said:PART 1: PART 2: Finally, 1 hour later, US authorities finally admitted that  it was only a drill  and that the dramatic lockdown had been lifted.Some might say this was not a hard event to call, and in fact was a  no-brainer    and in this case they would be correct. For any keen student of false flags and high-profile mass shootings in recent years, it was overtly obvious what kind of drama was playing out.The real story however, is how the entire US media transformed into one giant web of media disinformation amplification from the moment the false media reports and  official Tweets  from the US military hit the news wires   without even pausing to consider that they were all knowing, or unknowing (but certainly willing) participants within their media/press compartment of the so-called  Active Shooter  drill.JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016The mainstream media did their level best to use this falsely presented nonevent in order to reinforce the federal government s prime PR compliance directives; a running list of mindless Orwellian police state throw away slogans like,  See something, say something,  and  Shelter in place. The end result of all this is a public who are unnecessarily traumatized, or subjected to psychological stress, in effect terrorizing the public, as a result of poor media reporting and dereliction of journalism by a media profession who are all too happy to go along with a high TV ratings draw of a  Active Shooter  narrative.Rather amazingly, one reporter from CBS News even admitted that the national  lockdown  scare did not even interrupt that day s drill and that their on-base Active Shooter exercise would continue throughout the day. This should provide as much evidence as one would need to deduce that the media scare was indeed part of the drill itself, although this concept might prove just too difficult to grasp for any US mainstream news anchor or reporter. Watch the CBS report here:  What happened is a common thing, it s just, you know, it s sort of the times we live in  there were two personnel carrying rifles, long guns, someone in the medical center saw that and phoned in there was a shooter on the base Williams then brushed the misreporting off as  normal,  before also parroting the tired mantra,  When you see something, say something.  Watch as a confused Williams tries to rationalize the day s over-the-top media debacle: Luckily, it did not, but yesterdays event does raise some very crucial questions about the highly reactionary and irrational nature of our security-obsessed media, and a police state  fusion  apparatus which spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer funds each year in order prepare for some ubiquitous  threat  which statistically does not actually threaten very many Americans and yet   seems to overly-dominate media coverage, as well the operating budgets government agencies and first responder cohorts nationwide.The following is a short video which every American should watch, which explains some of the more worrying aspects of America s new obsession with domestic hyper militarized responses   in preparation for what seems like an endless stream of  mass shooting  and  domestic terror  events: Support our work and Become a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 1, 2016",century wire yesterday media country base home president air force airliner shooter situation media orange mode drill news shooter emergency call law enforcement gunman base fact distress call staff member grow facility country secure security media event shooter crisis fact base shooter exercise morning media crisis panel security justice media base situation analyst story event time media part part hour drill event fact brainer case student profile mass kind drama story media web media amplification moment media news knowing unknowing media press compartment shooter drill report shooter personnel place base media level order government compliance list police state something something shelter place end result public stress effect public result media dereliction journalism media profession draw shooter reporter news scare day drill base shooter exercise day evidence media scare part drill concept news anchor reporter report thing sort times personnel someone center shooter base mantra something something watch day media event nature security media police state fusion apparatus millions taxpayer funds year order prepare threat media coverage operating government responder following video obsession hyper preparation stream mass shooting terror work member

4829, SCOTUS Won’t Uphold NC’s Voter Suppression Law And McCrory’s Whining Like A Spoiled Brat About It,"SCOTUS returned a split 4-4 decision on North Carolina s repressive voter ID law, which means the lower court s ruling that it s unconstitutional stands. North Carolina cannot use that law in November as a basis for turning people away from the polls, and, predictably, Governor Pat McCrory is unhappy with this. His statement on the matter reads more like a toddler whining about being punished for being bad than anything: North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a common-sense voter ID law Even without any support from our state s attorney general, we were pleased that four justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. B-O-O H-O-O. Our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for this because McCrory s a delusional twit. Whose rights are being violated without this repressive law in effect? This law is what violates people s basic voting rights.The lower court held that this particular law was actually a voter suppression law, enacted with the intent to suppress minority votes. Why? Probably because North Carolina is a swing state, so every vote really does matter, and they can t have too many people voting Democratic, especially in a presidential year, now can they?No, they can t. Republicans lose power when too many minorities vote. The horror.What McCrory is missing is that, yes, 30 other states have voter ID laws of some sort, but several of those states have seen part, or all, of their laws struck down as well. Those states include North Dakota (home of the attempted six-week abortion ban), Texas, and Wisconsin. Other states Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, Virginia, Ohio and Georgia have litigation on their laws pending.SCOTUS hasn t ruled on all of these cases, and they may not, depending on what else there is to be heard from other states. To hear McCrory talk, however, one would think that all of the courts in the entire country had ruled specifically against North Carolina when other states must have worse laws. These laws don t protect  one person, one vote,  though. They protect Republicans.So what, exactly, did SCOTUS refuse to grant a stay on? North Carolina tried to tighten restrictions on acceptable IDs, for one. That inevitably harms poor minorities. It can also harm young people, who like to vote Democratic more than Republican.They also reduced early voting, another blow to the minority community; eliminated both same-day registration and out-of-precinct provisional ballots; and they eliminated pre-registration for 16- and 17-year olds that indicates an intent to vote when they turn 18.McCrory can cry about this all he wants   this is a major victory for everyone who believes in civil rights. The law will stay off the books for November, helping to keep the state in play for the presidential election, ensuring that many more voices are heard, and hopefully meaning that McCrory will lose his job.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2016",split decision voter id law court cannot use law basis people statement matter toddler anything voting integrity person vote sense voter id law support state attorney general justice right voter hearts peanut butter twit law effect law people voting court law voter suppression law intent minority state vote matter people year power horror voter id sort part home week abortion ban litigation talk country person vote refuse stay people voting blow minority community day registration registration year intent victory everyone law state play election job image chip

22305,Obama Signs Star Wars II Defense Bill: Hypocrisy of Blaming Trump for “Arms Race”,"21st Century Wire says While politicians and news media alike are accusing Trump of pushing an  arms race  in his December 22nd Tweet about strengthening America s nuclear capability, the Obama administration made a landmark change to the policies governing space based weapons under the guise of missile defense. Why is the mainstream media silent on what Obama just did? Not only does this potentially damage relationships with other military powers such as Russia and China but is being called a massive waste of money. Leading defence scientists said the idea that a space-based system could provide security against nuclear attack is a fantasy   Tyler Durden Zero HedgeAs politicians and mainstream media blast Trump s apparently incendiary tweet regarding nuclear arms, none other than President Obama just signed legislation that, by striking a single word from longstanding US nuclear defence policy, could heighten tensions with Russia and China and launch the country on an expensive effort to build space-based defense systems.Oh the irony  Following Trump s tweet The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016The mainstream media has lambasted the president-elect for  endangering the world  and  starting another nuclear arms race.  However, that same mainstream media appears mute in their response to what President Obama just did The National Defence Authorisation Act, a year-end policy bill encompassing virtually every aspect of the US military, contained two provisions with potentially momentous consequences. As AP reports,One struck the word  limited  from language describing the mission of the country s homeland missile defence system. The system is said to be designed to thwart a small-scale attack by a non-superpower such as North Korea or Iran.A related provision calls for the Pentagon to start  research, development, test and evaluation  of space-based systems for missile defence.Together, the provisions signal that the US will seek to use advanced technology to defeat both small-scale and large-scale nuclear attacks.That could unsettle the decades-old balance of power among the major nuclear states.Huge bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress approved the policy changes over the past month, with virtually no public debate.Although the White House had earlier criticised the changes, it stopped short of threatening a veto. On Friday, Obama signed the legislation.Leading defence scientists said the idea that a space-based system could provide security against nuclear attack is a fantasy It defies the laws of physics and is not based on science of any kind,  said L. David Montague, a retired president of missile systems for Lockheed and co-chair of a National Academy of Sciences panel that studied missile defence technologies at the request of Congress. Even if we darken the sky with hundreds or thousands of satellites and interceptors, there s no way to ensure against a dedicated attack,  Montague said in an interview.  So it s an opportunity to waste a prodigious amount of money. He called the provisions passed by Congress  insanity, pure and simple. Republican Congressman Trent Franks, who introduced and shepherded the policy changes in the House, said he drew inspiration from former president Ronald Reagan s Strategic Defence Initiative of the 1980s, which was intended to use lasers and other space-based weaponry to render nuclear weapons  impotent and obsolete.  Known as  Star Wars , the initiative cost taxpayers US$30 billion, but no system was ever deployed.Philip E. Coyle III, a former assistant secretary of defence who headed the Pentagon office responsible for testing and evaluating weapon systems, described the idea of a space-based nuclear shield as  a sham . To do this would cost just gazillions and gazillions,  Coyle said.  The technology isn t at hand   nor is the money. It s unfortunate from my point of view that the Congress doesn t see that. He added:  Both Russia and China will use it as an excuse to do something that they want to do.

7954," Police: Kalamazoo Spree Killer Was Uber Driver, Picked Up Customers Throughout The Night","In a disturbing twist to an already-terrifying story, the man believed to be behind the spree killing in Kalamazoo, Michigan is reportedly an Uber driver who continued to pick up fares between his murder rampage.The suspect, identified as Jason Dalton by police, went on a shooting spree at several different locations that left six people dead and another two injured. An 8-year-old child is said to be one of the victims. A 16-year-old continues to fight for her life in a local hospital. The Kalamazoo County Undersheriff told reporters that so far there is no known motive, just a guy with a gun who spent the night murdering innocent people. In summary, what it looks like is we have somebody just driving around, finding people and shooting them dead in their tracks. But perhaps there was a warning sign, and police may have missed it.In a Facebook post reportedly created just an hour before news of shootings began to fly in, a Kalamazoo woman wrote a lengthy complaint about an Uber driver named  Jason  who was acting aggressively, driving erratically, and appeared to be either on drugs or mentally unstable. The post has since been deleted but it was captured by several news outlets.Police and state prosecutors now say they are looking into the post.UPDATE: Prosecutors confirm they are looking into whether this Facebook post is indeed about the Kalamazoo shooter. pic.twitter.com/kS8K7vrYk9  Luke Stier (@LukeStier) February 21, 2016In the message, the woman says her fiance got into an Uber with the man and was instantly terrified by his behavior. He was driving VERY erratically. They sideswiped a car blowing through a stop sign at Henderson castle and West Main Hill, and the driver continued driving. Then this man proceeded to drive 80mph down west main swerving in and out of oncoming traffic.She went on to say that she called 911, but the operator  didn t seem all that concerned. Uber later confirmed that Jason Dalton did indeed work for their company and that he had passed their background check.Statement from Uber after police confirmed to @woodtv that #KalamazooShooting suspect Jason Dalton was Uber driver. pic.twitter.com/97b3mSclPF  Danny Hopkins (@danny_hopkins) February 21, 2016Dalton has been arrested and a gun has been recovered from his vehicle. So far police have no motive for what drove him to kill seemingly at random.In a sick  coincidence , Michigan s Republican-led legislature is currently pushing to drop the requirement that Michigan gun owners get concealed carry permits and take a safety course in responsible gun use saying those burdens are an example of government overreach.

3085, Trump Just Told His Most INSANE Inauguration Lie Yet And Is Getting Torn APART For It (TWEETS),"President-elect Donald Trump is currently trying to drown out all his insecurities after Meryl Streep absolutely gutted him in her Golden Globes speech on Sunday night. So far, he s spent Monday trying to trash Steep on Twitter, take credit for jobs he didn t create, and now he s trying to hype up his own inauguration. Of course, he s failing miserably at all of these   but he just got called out in a major way.Apparently oblivious to the fact that the whole country knows his inauguration is an embarrassment because no respectable celebrity wants to perform for him, Trump told an insane lie about how popular his inauguration was going to be   despite the fact that his parade has been significantly shortened due to its unpopularity. Trump actually said that so many people would be attending his inauguration that all the dress shops in Washington were sold out! He said in an interview with The New York Times: We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars. All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. Everyone is shocked by this statement   especially the shopkeepers in Washington, who actually have tons of evening gowns available! In an amazing fact-check by The Washington Post, VP and manager of Friendship Heights  Neiman Marcus store Martha Slagle was quoted debunking Trump s lies: Definitely not. You have more than a thousand evening gowns to choose from. Slagle also said her store was  stuffed with beautiful gowns  and that other smaller stores  always have dresses  because stores stock up ahead of the inauguration in case there is a high demand (however, there doesn t seem to be). As if this weren t humiliating enough for Trump, he s been getting destroyed on Twitter for this, and it s absolutely hilarious:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTrump is a pathological liar and psychopath.

13993,HEARTWARMING: Support For Socialism On College Campuses Much Less Than Media Would Like Americans To Believe,"Proof that sanity still exists on college campuses.Capitalists on campus won t have to stand by any longer while communists and socialists celebrate May Day, as they ve appropriated the holiday. Turning Point USA offered free materials to students with a comprehensive plan for the Socialism Sucks Day of Action.More than 500 campuses are participating in the counter-celebration on Monday.  I want the American Dream. Socialism only takes away my chance to start a multi-billion company in my apartment,  Turning Point USA s Josh Thifault declared.  It s important that we stick to the values that made our country great   capitalism and freedom. Some students have caught on to what Venezuela has learned the hard way. Venezuela s brewing company, responsible for 80 percent of its beer supply, began to shut down its last plant on Friday, according to The Wall Street Journal. In addition to how Venezuelans  like to celebrate,  there is concern because the beer factory also provided jobs. The country has suffered food shortages and power outages, and can no longer afford to print its own money. Venezuelans are also learning that  socialism sucks  and are petitioning to recall President Nicol s Maduro.In stark contrast to the student activities in other parts of America, May Day was celebrated with violence in Seattle. At least nine were arrested for pelting officers with rocks, batons, and molotov cocktails, which injured at least five officers. The violence has been an annual trend in Seattle for May Day, as Yahoo!

163, This 2016 Hannity Tweet Is Now Like A Knife In The Back For Trump,"No one on earth has been a bigger cheerleader for Donald Trump than Fox News  Sean Hannity. In the wake of Monday s indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Manafort s top aide Rick Gates and with a guilty plea of former economic advisor to Trump, George Papadopoulos, it appears the house of cards is beginning to collapse.Hannity, though, is ready with the pro-Trump propaganda. Immediately after the news of the indictment hit, Hannity was ready with his defense of Trump which means he s blaming Hillary:Not that there wasn t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal. We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.Not surprisingly, Trump s statements are mirroring Hannity:Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017  Only, Manafort was part of the Trump campaign during many of these alleged crimes and Hannity knows it. In fact, in 2016, he tweeted it:While a Sean Hannity tweet certainly won t stand up in a court of law, Hannity has long been the media sycophant for the Trump administration.

76, WATCH: Nicolle Wallace Takes Trump To The Woodshed For Backing Pedophile Moore,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Nicolle Wallace for endorsing an accused child molester.Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual assault by several women, most of whom were teens at the time. One woman was 14-years-old.Age of consent laws apparently did not matter to Moore, who was the district attorney during the time period in which most of the assaults allegedly occurred. Moore own former colleagues have confirmed that Moore preyed upon teenage girls and he was even banned from a shopping mall because he kept creeping on teen girls.On Tuesday, Trump finally spoke out about Moore and the allegations. And what he said was sickening.Trump accused Moore s opponent Doug Jones of being  soft  on crime before saying he d rather have an accused child molester in the Senate instead of a Democrat. Then he defended Moore the same way he defended Vladimir Putin during his trip to Asia. Well, he denies it, Trump said.  Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn t happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. Trump s words were so disgusting that MSNBC s Nicolle Wallace took him to the woodshed. I have this physical feeling of just being repulsed listening to   be it a figure head, he is the head of the Republican Party and I have described myself as a nonpracticing member, but I don t know what other word to use other than repulsed, that the head of the Republican Party said essentially threw his weight behind someone accused of stalking and engaging in sexual activity with a 14-year-old. There s nothing normal about throwing your weight behind a child molester. So when he says, this president says  he denies it, he denies it  I almost heard in him,  I denied it too.  He s almost projecting on to Roy Moore his own circumstance. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump was accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women during the campaign. He called all of them liars at the time. And it looks like that s coming back to bite Trump on the ass.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 21, 2017",trump ass child senate candidate assault teens time woman age consent matter district attorney time period shopping mall trump trump opponent crime child senate democrat way trip trump look happen feeling listening figure head head party member word head party weight someone activity year nothing weight child molester president circumstance video assault dozen campaign time trump ass image

2026," Woman CORNERS GOP Senator Trapped On Flight, DEMANDS Explanation To Trumpcare (DETAILS)","A Republican Senator found himself in a tough position when he was trapped on a flight with an American citizen who wanted answers about the disgusting repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Oklahoma resident Kendall Brown noticed that she was on the same flight as Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) on Thursday evening, and decided to take him up on his claim that he would  listen to all voices  if anyone had questions about the GOP s new health care bill. Brown had previously sent letters, emails, and tweets to Lankford, but so far she had been unable to get a response to her questions. However, now that she realized Lankford was trapped on the same airplane with her, she decided this was a great opportunity to get some answers.Once Brown noticed Lankford, she posted a photo of him to her Facebook page, and soon people were begging her to ask him questions. Brown first tried to get Lankford s attention on Twitter, asking him to chat with her about Trump s disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare:  However, Brown still didn t get a response. Twitter users even began to suggest that Brown try to approach him in person. Brown opted to write him a note, and by the time she was finished she must have gotten Lankford s attention because he actually approached her!Lankford asked Brown  specifically  what her question was and she said: I want to share my story with you and I want to have my voice heard on why the ACA is important to me. The conversation ended with an agreement to speak sometime in the near future about the GOP s bill at length.UPDATE: I spoke with @SenatorLankford and gave him this. I m very hopeful we ll be able to get coffee this week & look forward to chatting! pic.twitter.com/AtbRwkJm6P  Kendally Brown ? (@kendallybrown) March 24, 2017While Brown doesn t think Lankford will meet her in person, she hopes they might chat on the phone. She is passionate about addressing her concerns with Lankford, because earlier that day Lankford said in an interview that he would  listen to all voices    something that Brown doesn t think he truly means, considering he hasn t held a town hall on the topic yet. She said: He pretty specifically isn t listening to all voices right now and that s why I approached him. I know there are a lot of people out there that have just as compelling stories about why they need the ACA. So, I had an obligation to approach him, not just for me but for everyone. As Brown s story has gotten more attention, her social media accounts are now full of stories from Americans stating how Obamacare helped them. Brown says she is going to print these stories out and give them to Lankford so he can see how disastrous the repeal and replacement of Obamacare might be.Featured image via Kendally Brown Facebook",News,"March 24, 2017",senator position flight citizen disgusting repeal replacement resident brown flight sen evening claim anyone health care bill response airplane opportunity photo page people attention twitter trump plan response twitter try person note time attention question share story voice conversation agreement future bill update coffee week pic twitter march person phone day interview something town hall topic lot people obligation everyone story attention media repeal replacement image
949," Trump Erupts During Speech To ‘Honor’ Veterans, What He Did Is Beyond Disrespectful (VIDEO)","On Saturday night, during a speech to honor veterans in Washington, Donald Trump once again perfectly demonstrated what a petulant child he is and how little he cares about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.Trump was speaking at the  Celebrate Freedom Rally , where he should have been thanking and praising the veterans in attendance. Instead, he completely derailed and went off on one of his characteristically self-centered rants, proving that he is incapable of acting presidential and focusing on anything but himself for more than a few minutes.While some might hope that Trump chose to stop honoring veterans to make an important announcement, most Americans know that wasn t what happened. Instead, Trump stopped his speech to rant about the  fake media  and bragged about how he d won the election (conveniently leaving out the fact that he lost the popular vote by literally millions).No one understands how Trump went from commending veterans to talking about the media and his presidency, but here s his awful rant: We will not let them because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House but I m president and they re not. The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used a hatchet. And the people saw it right from the beginning. The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf our great American people. It will never happen. Their agenda is not your agenda. Considering that Trump had spent his entire Saturday attacking the press, from CNN to MSNBC, he clearly needed to get this out of his system   and it was in extremely poor taste to do it at this event. Trump s insensitivity, immaturity and self-centeredness continues to embarrass the country, and every American who supported Trump should be ashamed.

7272, Ted Nugent Insults Women Everywhere By Disgustingly Listing Why Men Prefer Guns (IMAGE),"Ted Nugent is once again degrading a segment of the population and this time he targeted women.In a Facebook post devoted to his love of his guns, all of which he has undoubtedly f*cked repeatedly, the conservative rocker listed the reasons why men prefer their guns over women. You can trade an old 44 for a new 22,  Nugent wrote as reason number ten on the offensive list, which then became even more cringe-worthy as it continued.Nugent went on to explain how  You can keep one gun at home and have another for when you re on the road,  and even went so far as to say that women don t act normally all month long like guns do even though PMS is a normal bodily function that all women go through in their lives.In his top reason, Nugent lamented that he can t make women shut their mouths like keeping a gun silent with a silencer.Here s his full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Top ten reasons men prefer guns over women-#10   You can trade an old 44 for a new 22.#9   You can keep one gun at Posted by Ted Nugent on Thursday, March 24, 2016This isn t the first time the Donald Trump fan has acted like a complete asshole toward women.According to Media Matters,  Nugent has a lengthy history of misogynist commentary, including calling women  worthless bitch,   worthless whore,   toxic cunt,   fat pig,  and  dirty whore. And in a disgusting defense of Trump, who is in the middle of trying to portray himself as the best candidate for women, Nugent went on a tirade against Fox News host Megyn Kelly in which the Motor City Madman said: I often turn on Fox just to look at her. Sometimes when I m loading my [gun ammunition] magazines, I like to just look at her. And I usually sit naked on the couch dropping hot brass on my stuff. Not only does Nugent prefer guns to real women, he also prefers teen girls over women as well. He wrote and performed a song about raping a 13-year-old girl in 1981. Two years earlier, Nugent suckered a 17-year-old girl s parents into making him her legal guardian so he could have sex with her.In short, not only is Nugent a coward when it comes time for real men to take action in defense of their country, he s terrified of strong independent women who think for themselves.

5477, GOP Convention Chaos Ensues As Reince Priebus Meets With #NeverTrump Delegates,"Anyone with a brain knows that Donald Trump is an embarrassment to the United States on the world stage at best, and dangerously unqualified to hold the office of the presidency at worst. Despite these facts, many in the GOP establishment have lined up behind the billionaire who unexpectedly became their presumptive nominee. However, there is a problem. There are GOP delegates who are doing all they can to deny Trump the nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland, which is just days away.Because of the apparently inevitable convention floor fight, the Rules Committee meeting that began at 8:00 AM as scheduled was suddenly halted once a delegate put forth the idea of a rule that would disallow lobbyists from joining the Republican National Committee (RNC). After that, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus scuttled away into a private meeting with Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and some of the #NeverTrump delegates. Also present was Colorado delegate and  Free the Delegates  leader  Kendal Unruh, who wants the RNC Rules Committee to unbind the delegates and allow them to vote against Trump, no matter what the voters in their state decided.There were surely clashes in this meeting, as fierce #NeverTrump types like Unruh were in that impromptu secret meeting with people such as Platform Committee member Jim Bopp, who vehemently opposes any and all efforts to stop Trump. There was also former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who seems to wish to dismantle the amount of power the RNC has altogether.In other words, just days before the GOP Convention, the event that is supposed to be the party s big coming out, there is utter chaos, and it is all because of Donald Trump. The illustration of just how chaotic it all has become is all in the excuse that was given to the press for the abrupt disruption of the Rules Committee session: a printer had jammed and they were making sure that got fixed first. Absolutely hilarious, to Democrats, at least.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"July 14, 2016",anyone brain trump embarrassment world stage office presidency establishment billionaire nominee problem nomination convention days convention floor committee meeting delegate idea rule committee chairman meeting senator mike lee delegate leader committee trump matter state meeting impromptu meeting people committee member trump attorney amount power days convention event party chaos illustration excuse press disruption committee session printer image mark

Among a host of other successes, the United States negotiated a reduction of over $285 million off the 2016-2017 final budget. In addition to these significant cost savings, we reduced the UN s bloated management and support functions, bolstered support for key U.S. priorities throughout the world, and instilled more discipline and accountability throughout the UN system. The inefficiency and overspending of the United Nations are well known. We will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of or remain unchecked. This historic reduction in spending   in addition to many other moves toward a more efficient and accountable UN   is a big step in the right direction. While we are pleased with the results of this year s budget negotiations, you can be sure we ll continue to look at ways to increase the UN s efficiency  while protecting our interests,  said Ambassador Haley.THE UNITED STATES CARRIES THE BURDEN OF THE UN BUDGET:MAGA!

6412, Donald Trump’s Longtime Butler Calls For Obama To Be Killed In Unhinged Facebook Rant,"If a man s character really is about the company he keeps, then what does it say about Donald Trump that his longtime butler (yes, he has a longtime butler) and newly appointed  in house historian  for the Trump family just called for President Obama to be killed?Anthony Senecal, who looks like a cross between Batman s butler Alfred and the monopoly guy, took it upon himself to post a lengthy, unhinged rant on Facebook. It s safe to say he is not a fan of Obama or basic grammar.To all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed  president  !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!! Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!! Now comes Donald J Trump to put an end to the corruption in government !!!! The so called elite, who are nothing but common dog turds from your front lawn are shaking in their boots because there is a new Sheriff coming to town, and the end to their corruption of the American people (YOU) is at hand !!!! I cannot believe that a common murder is even allowed to run (killery clinton) OR that a commie like bernie is a also allowed to also run !!!! Come on America put your big boy pants on this election you have a choice GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE !!!! Thank you !!!!To summarize, Senecal wanted Obama to be kidnapped by America s own military and executed in his first term. He seemed to desire similar fates for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as well.And having won a second term, Senecal decided Obama alternatively needed to be  hung [sic] for treason. via FacebookMother Jones couldn t believe that Senecal would actually write that, and called him up to ask if his Facebook account had been hacked. Instead, he tersely confirmed,  I wrote that. I believe that. In other posts, Senecal has agreed with his boss that Obama is not a U.S. citizen and routinely only refers to Obama as  zero (O)  or creative epithets. When asked why he was calling for Obama to be killed, Trump s close friend replied: I cannot stand the bastard. I don t believe he s an American citizen. I think he s a fraudulent piece of crap that was brought in by the Democrats. Like many of Trump s closest associates, Senecal appears to be a complete and utter lunatic. These friends are now expecting a place for themselves in Trump s White House. Trump, who once flatly stated that he would make an exception in his Muslim ban for his Middle Eastern business associates, is clearly the type of guy who doesn t mind throwing a bone to his yes-men.In a gushing piece on Senecal published by the New York Times a few months ago, Trump s butler tellingly referred to Donald as  the king.  And this chilling anecdote:Mr. Senecal s admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits. On March 6, as Mr. Trump made his way through the living room on his way to the golf course, Mr. Senecal called out  All rise!  to the club members and staff.

9795,"ANGRY LEFTIST CAUGHT On VIDEO Stealing Student’s Trump Hat…DEMANDS School Makes Him Stop Wearing Hat: “F*** your f***ing freedom of speech, boy!”","***WARNING***This video will make your blood boil. The exchange between this Hispanic woman, (who we re pretty sure is not a legal citizen, based on her comment to the victim, when she screamed,  F*ck your laws!  after he cited his right to free-speech) and the victim is stunning. Over and over again, this ill-informed and unbelievably angry student makes up her own facts with absolutely no basis whatsoever.  Saying things like the signature Trump hat that reads  Make America GReat Again  represents  the genocide of a bunch of people  and  America was never great  and of but of course,  You stole this land!  Just another ungrateful immigrant who is likely one of Obama s  Dreamers. According to Campus Reform, here s how the unbelievable exchange went down:A Trump-supporting student at the University of California, Riverside had his MAGA hat stolen by a peer who demanded that administrators refuse to allow him to continue to wear it.A video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform shows an enraged female student taking the hat to the school s Student Life Department as Matthew Vitale fruitlessly attempts to explain to the young woman that the hat is his property. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t,  she continues as several staffers look on. Are you people not going to do anything? She is stealing my property,  Vitale pleads, though the altercation went on for several more minutes. We will need to return his property to him, but we can talk about  one university employee begins to explain before being abruptly cut off by the student thief. How about we talk about not letting him wear this sh*t on campus?  the thief retorts, while Vitale later tells a growing presence of administrators that  the fact that you people haven t gotten this back for me is sad and wrong. The altercation continued for several minutes until the hat was relinquished to an administrator who then returned it to Vitale, though not before his fellow student got in the last word.

6072," The PGA Just Gave Donald Trump A Big Middle Finger, And He’s P*ssed","Long before Donald Trump owned the Doral Golf Course   in 1962, to be exact   it became the home to the PGA World Golf Championships. Now, the tournament is moving to Mexico, one of the countries the presidential candidate rants the most about on the campaign trial, and the billionaire is not happy, not at all.Supposedly, it s not a political move. It is purely economic. The auto manufacturer, Cadillac, pulled out of sponsorship, so they have to leave Trump s resort and head to cheaper grounds.Fox News asked Trump about the move, and he didn t waiver from his antagonistic and xenophobic campaign rhetoric. Cadillac s been a great sponsor, but they re moving it to Mexico,  Trump said in a Tuesday night interview on Fox News.  They re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. They re moving it to Mexico City,  he continued.  And I m saying, you know, what s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what s going on with our country. For Cadillac, it all boiled down to money. The cost to them for sponsorship is well above $10 million for a single tournament. Beyond that, people just don t care that much anymore. The tournament has lost its luster,  said Erik Compton, a PGA Tour player who lives in Miami.  The community just doesn t seem as involved. Source: ESPNWhile this isn t political, Trump obviously takes it very personally   as he should. While this wasn t intended to be a Donald Trump snub, almost any country would have been better for Trump than Mexico, the country against which Trump wants to build a giant wall. It s also a country Trump has accused of intentionally sending its criminals our way: The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this,  Trump wrote.  Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.

14563,OBAMA TO VISIT MOSQUE WHERE RADICAL IMAM Condones Suicide Bombings…Even MORE Unbelievable Is List Of Muslims Who Committed Horrific Acts Of Terror Against Americans Who Prayed There,"Our Imam In Chief told America he was a Christian when he wanted us to elect him in 2007. His Black Liberation Theology Pastor of hate later revealed that Barack only used the church as a way to boost his status as a community organizer. He s been openly mocking Christianity for years now and now, of all the mosques in America he feels compelled to visit, it just happens to be one with a radical Imam and ties to several terrorists who have committed atrocities against Americans.All is forgiven with ignorant liberals who believe terror organization CAIR, when they say Obama just wants to send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. President Obama is set to speak next week at a mosque which was led for over a decade by an Imam who justified suicide bombings in some circumstances and who helped found a mosque with ties to Al Qaeda.The President will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday and deliver remarks there, the White House confirmed on Saturday. This will be the first time the President has paid an official visit to a mosque during his seven years as President. However, Obama has toured mosques while on overseas trips. The president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity,  White House spokesman Keith Maley said, confirming reports.  As the president has said, Muslim Americans are our friends, and neighbors; our co-workers, and sports heroes   and our men and women in uniform defending our country. The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) which has been declared a terrorist organization in the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation s Hamas-funding operation welcomed Obama s decision. For a number of years we ve been encouraging the president to go to an American mosque,  said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper.  With the tremendous rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. But critics of Obama s decision may question his choice of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where Mohamad Adam el-Sheikh, a native of Sudan and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, led the institution for eighteen years as its Imam.Before becoming Imam there, el-Sheikh helped found the Muslim American Society, an outfit created by Muslim Brotherhood members.In 2004, he told the Washington Post, commenting on Palestinian suicide bombers:  If certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle. El-Sheikh also helped found the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque, which was once led by the deceased infamous Al Qaeda terrorist Anwar Al Awlaki.When he left the Islamic Society of Baltimore, El Sheikh became the Imam of Dar Al-Hijrah, following Awlaki s escape from the U.S. after the September 11 attacks.The Dar Al-Hijrah mosque was founded thanks, in part, to a large grant from Saudi Arabia s Embassy in the United States, which allowed for the large facility to accommodate some 5,000 Muslims.Dar Al-Hijrah, which is located right outside Washington, D.C., is connected to several high-profile Islamic terrorists who prayed there, including Major Nidal Hassan   the Ft. Hood massacre jihadi, two September 11 hijackers, and an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jan 31, 2016",imam chief liberation theology pastor hate church way status community organizer imam terror organization message inclusion respect president week mosque decade imam mosque president society house time president visit mosque president president nation diversity house spokesman president sports men country council organization conspirator holy land foundation operation decision number president mosque spokesman hooper rise sentiment country message inclusion respect decision choice society el native member brotherhood institution imam imam society outfit brotherhood post suicide rule principle el dar al mosque al al society imam dar al escape dar al mosque thanks part grant embassy facility al profile hood massacre conspirator world trade center news
5002, Racist Florida Woman Tells Black People ‘You Should Have Stayed In Africa’ In INSANE Rant (VIDEO),"A racist white woman in Florida is surely furious after her African-American neighbors posted a video of her dissolving into a hate-filled mess outside her home on a residential street in Tallahassee, Florida. The video was apparently recorded in March, but the teens who captured the magical moment in which this classy, white, pink bikini-clad lady unleashed a stream of verbal diarrhea all over the sidewalk, posted the footage online recently.The woman, who is apparently drunk, begins by making fun of the African-American females  bodies. When a male in the back says  black don t crack, baby,  things went from zero to racist instantly. Black don t crack?  the likely Trump voter responds.  Black IS crack. Crack IS black! But she wasn t done there. The unidentified Cracker-American told the  black b*tches  (her cute nickname for them): You all should have stayed in Africa. And you can go back there, it s free. You know you can go back to Africa, if you want to. And you can take your Washington and Jefferson last names. One of the teens decided to remind her she is being recorded    don t say nothing else    but our intoxicated white friend was in full-Trump mode. We re gonna take over these neighborhoods,  she says, continuing her slack-jawed diatribe.  Martin Luther King was a sl*t! He was a sl*t who was f*cking white people. Martin Luther was f*cking white people the day he died. Ultimately, the lady s hate-filled frenzy became so irritating for her daughter, who was forced to stand in the background and attempt to ignore her mother s idiocy, had to step in. The daughter screamed  Mom, will you stop  as she grabbed her hand and tried to pull her back. It s ridiculous that your own child has to tell you to stop,  one of the teens said, and it truly is.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 18, 2016",racist woman video dissolving hate mess home street video march teens moment pink bikini clad lady stream diarrhea sidewalk footage woman fun male back crack baby crack trump voter crack cracker nickname teens nothing friend trump mode take slack martin king people people day lady hate frenzy daughter background attempt mother idiocy daughter hand child teens image capture
20701,FLASHBACK: ESPN Female Reporter Still Employed After Being CAUGHT ON VIDEO Berating Garage Attendant…Curt Schilling Fired After Sharing Conservative Views On Facebook,"Leftist Disney owned ESPN has a strange way of determining who is and isn t the type of host they want to be the face of their network.  ESPN just fired baseball great Curt Schilling for sharing an opinion that was contrary to that of leftist Disney owned ESPN when he shared this meme on his personal Facebook page:Schilling added,  A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don t care what they are, who they sleep with, men s room was designed for the penis, women s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic. ESPN then fired Schilling, announcing,  ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated. Asked about the controversy on local radio, Schilling explained,  To be in a place where people actually believe I m a racist or I m transphobic says to me that something has gone horribly askew somewhere. This wasn t the first time Schilling felt the heat from ESPN for his political views. He got slammed for retweeting a graphic that read,  It s said only 5%-10% of Muslims are extremists. In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. How d that go?  Schilling added,  The math is staggering when you get to true # s.  This was too much for ESPN, which had to step in to defend ISIS, and promptly suspended him from broadcast.Schilling made the horrible mistake of speaking truth in a place where only leftist falsehood is tolerated. ESPN has no problem firing a beloved host for speaking out against radical Islam and the LGBTQ-WXYZ Mafia. ESPN seems to have a soft spot however for female reporters like Britt McHenry (seen in video below) who berate and bully women who she considers to be less fortunate and important than her. Watch here:McHenry was given a one week suspension for her horrific and condescending behavior.ESPN host Stephen A. Smith spoke about former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice beating his then-girlfriend, and stated,  We also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation. Not that there s real provocation, but the elements of provocation, you got to make sure that you address them, because we ve got to do is do what we can to try to prevent the situation from happening in any way. And I don t think that s broached enough, is all I m saying. No point of blame.  He was suspended for one week. Schilling suggesting that women be protected from men invading their restrooms, however, was a fireable offense.In the aftermath of the same incident, ESPN host Max Kellerman told a charming story about how when he was dating his now-wife, they were both drunk; she slapped him, and he slapped her back. That carried a short suspension. Kellerman is now back on the air regularly.None of these people committed the ultimate crime: stating that men and women are biologically different and should pee in different places. ESPN, of course, also stumps for more coverage of women s sports, which suggests a question: why not simply open up all women s sports to men, in the name of equality for people of all genders? Or wouldn t that comply with the logically incoherent leftist positional chart?To see more examples of people still working at ESPN who should ve been canned: Daily Wire",left-news,"Apr 21, 2016",way type host face network baseball curt opinion page schilling man man matter men room penis company curt schilling conduct employment controversy radio schilling place people racist something time heat math broadcast mistake truth place falsehood problem host spot video watch week suspension horrific host spoke ravens ray rice provocation provocation provocation situation way point blame week men offense aftermath incident host story wife suspension air none people crime men course coverage sports question sports men name equality people comply chart people wire

22010,"Message for Progressive Left: ‘If You Want to See Real Nazis, Come to Ukraine’","Ever since last month, the US media and the left wing politicians have been up in arm about alleged  rise of Nazism in America.  By now, the coverage has been incessant and beyond hysterical, as pundits and  antifascist  activists claim that a viable white supremacist movement is threatening to take over the country   which is a media-driven alternative reality. What America s mainstream media establishment will not mention is the US government s own role, particularly that of the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton s State Department (and funded by her campaign financier George Soros) in helping to fuel the scourge of Nazism in eastern Europe, in the Ukraine. Likewise, Republicans and so-called  conservatives  will not want to mention party luminary Senator John McCain s own personal role in promoting Ukraine s Far Right parties and helping shoe-horn them into power in 2014 after a successful US-backed coup d etat and putsch, and the disastrous junta which has followed.The following open letter was posted by Aleksandr Gontar from Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, skillfully articulates the current farce in the United States and the feigned righteous indignation from the progressive left over the recent staged political altercation in Charlottesville, Virginia I always considered myself as a person with left-wing views, but looking at what is happening in the US I can t escape the thought that the American left, in its majority, is the dumbest and most useless  comrade  on the planet. As a minimum, to profess liberal views and at the same time to call oneself  leftist  is a bit silly.The desperate fight of American comrades against  Nazis  in general is comical. They are shocked by a torchlight procession in Charlottesville, while regular torch processions in the capital of Ukraine, which they so fervently support in its  fight for democracy , don t shock them. I speak as well about simple red-blue rainbow plankton, as well as about the famous  fighters  against oppression a la Tom Morello (whom I respect as a musician) and other celebrities, cosplaying Che Guevara with a red star on the cap.  A nightmare, Nazis are in America! They hoisted the colors of the confederates and shaved their heads! OH MY GOD . American  Nazis  are the same clowns as American  anti- fascists , by the way.Kids, come into The Ukraine, we will show you Nazis. Real ones. Who kill people  kill massively, proceeding from the racial theory. They kill in savage ways like the SS did in the 40 s. We will show you a whole State that erects monuments to the ideologists and performers of the Holocaust, of Jewish riots, of the genocide of Poles. Who sweep away monuments to the liberators of mankind from Nazism. A State with a Nazi  Ministry of Truth,  repressions against dissent, promotion of racial hatred in schools, on TV, in children s books. A State in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs supervises a website that incites the committing of murder of unreliable citizens, openly publishing all their personal information as well as members of their families.So, when you will have such things in America, we will talk. When you have, instead of a car crashing into a crowd of anti-fascists, these anti-fascists like cattle are herded into the local House of Trade Unions and will be burned with Molotov cocktails (finishing off with steel poles those who try to escape), when the FBI creates a website on which it will publish the addresses of those who criticize Trump and the White Race, and the organized alt-right will start to go to these addresses, who, after your murder, will be called  patriots  and will be released, so then we will believe in your whining about Nazis.And for now, suck on it, Mr American anti-fascists.This letter was originally published at Stalker Zone, translated by Ollie Richardson and Angelina Siard.READ MORE ALT RIGHT NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ALT RIGHT FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"September 5, 2017",month media wing arm rise coverage movement country media reality media establishment government role administration state department campaign financier scourge likewise party senator role shoe power coup junta letter farce indignation left altercation person thought left majority comrade planet minimum time bit fight procession torch capital support fight democracy speak blue plankton oppression la morello musician che star cap nightmare colors anti way people theory savage ways state holocaust genocide mankind state ministry truth promotion state ministry murder information car crowd cattle house trade steel trump race alt right murder anti letter stalker zone news century wire alt work member
8203, Planned Parenthood Tells Carly Fiorina To Go F*ck Herself On The Way Out The Door (TWEETS),"If you have not heard, lying,  baby parts -obsessed windbag Carly Fiorina has dropped out of the presidential race. This is, of course, completely unsurprising given her poll numbers, which have traditionally been firmly in the gutter ever since it became common knowledge that the felons who created her favorite propaganda videos had heavily and deceptively edited them.On Wednesday, Fiorina joined fellow (former) 2016 hopeful Chris Christie in dropping out of the race. While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,  Fiorina said as she pretended she has accomplished anything more than helping convince a right-wing terrorist to shoot up a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado.As part of her outgoing message to  girls and women across the country,  Fiorina made it clear that females should not feel they have  to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you re a woman  (*cough*HillaryClinton*cough*).Planned Parenthood, the organization Fiorina has chosen to spend nearly every waking hour maligning, also had an outgoing message for the failed former Hewlett-Packer CEO. It wasn t  Bye, Felicia,  but it might as well have been. Farewell to @CarlyFiorina,  the women s health organization said in a tweet.

7531, Douchebag of the Day: Louie ‘Self Loathing Jews’ Gohmert,"Nothing pisses me off more than a Republican professing their undying love for Israel and the Jewish people. I m old enough to remember the distant past of the early 2000 s when the phrase  The Goddamn Jew Media  and  Those fucking Jews in Hollywood  were bandied about by conservatives. Why, I even recall a time when the front runner for the Republican primaries actively courted the KKK and neo-Nazi vote. Oh wait, that s happening right f*cking now.As a Jew myself, I find it amazing that conservatives can keep a straight face when praising Israel. Especially southern Republicans that were raised on a steady diet of Antisemitism. Should Israel ever elect a liberal government, we d be right back to Republicans despising Jews. Even Sheldon Adelson s billions wouldn t be enough to hide their disdain for us.But in the meantime, we re witness to the spectacle of not only Republicans pretending to love Jews, but Republicans having the balls to call some Jews  self-loathing. Earlier this week on  The Joyce Kaufman Show,  Rep. Louie Gohmert criticized President Obama and his Jewish supporters over a Wall Street Journal report about the administration s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dismissing the president s Jewish allies as self-hating.The Texas Republican said of Obama:  He s never been able to stand Israel. He s never been able to get along with people who actually stood for Israel. Now he gets along fine with the Israel-haters,  he continued.  But, and it breaks my heart, but there are some children of Israel who just apparently seem to be self-loathing when it comes to Israel   but yeah, those folks he gets along with fine. I have repeatedly anointed myself The World s Jew. I eat bacon. I celebrate Christmas. I mix meat and dairy. I literally only know Passover is coming when the supermarket puts matzoh bread on sale. Yet, the idea that I am a self-loathing Jew because I don t support the murderous right wing regime turning Israel in a full-fledged apartheid state is deeply offense. It s even more offensive coming from a person pretending not to hate Jews in the first place.The conflation of  Israel  and  Jew  is a deliberate and calculated move to shield Israel from criticism by leveling accusations of Antisemitism. But that doesn t exactly work on the millions of Jews like me around the world that are appalled at the violence and hatred perpetrated by Israel s government. So people try to label us self-loathing Jews.But I say that the only Jews who truly despise themselves are the ones that are rushing to embrace the same genocidal rage that brought us the Holocaust.In the meantime, Louie Gohmert can choke on a matzoh ball.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.",News,"March 12, 2016",nothing love people past phrase media time front runner vote wait face diet government disdain spectacle week president street report administration approach conflict president allies self republican people heart world bacon meat dairy passover supermarket bread sale idea self support wing regime apartheid state person place conflation deliberate move criticism work millions world violence government people rage holocaust ball image gage
9511,JIM BEAM Fans Call For Boycott After Spokesperson and Liberal Actress Brags About Taunting VP Mike Pence For Defending Life,"The decision of actress Mila Kunis to make monthly donations to abortion business Planned Parenthood in pro-life Vice President Mike Pence s name has generated a call for a boycott of Jim Beam on Twitter.Jim Beam global brand spokesperson Kunis told Conan O Brien Thursday that she donates to Planned Parenthood in Pence s name to protest his pro-life policies. O Brien asked Kunis to explain her  prank: I apologize if I m offending anybody. It s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do. And so as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says like,  An anonymous donation has been made in your name.  I don t look at it as a prank, this is like, I strongly disagree, and this is my little way of doing it. It s a peaceful protest.  Breitbart NewsThe new face of Jim Beam, the iconic bourbon brand, might not be quite what you expect. While a rough-around-the-edges cowboy or country rock star might seem to fit the bill Jim Beam has used Kid Rock at times in the past its newest spokesperson is the petite and beautiful Mila Kunis.The 30-year-old actress, who says she is a big fan of bourbon in general, is featured in two new 30-second Beam ads, as well as five other videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to more than three minutes.

13792,COMMUNIST VIETNAMESE LEADER THANKS U.S. Anti-War Activists For Helping With Their Victory Only Days Before Obama’s Visit,"Obama s historic Embracing the Communists Tour wouldn t be complete without a stop in Vietnam All on the American taxpayers dime, of course In the weeks leading up to Memorial Day and President Barack Obama s scheduled trip to Vietnam, a prominent Vietcong communist leader privately thanked American anti-war activists for helping defeat the U.S.-allied government in Vietnam in the 1970s, saying protest demonstrations throughout the United States were  extremely important in contributing to Vietnam s victory. For Vietnamese guerrilla leader Madam Nguyen Thi Binh, who sent the private letter from Hanoi dated April 20,  victory  meant the communist takeover of South Vietnam. The letter addressed veteran American anti-war activists who gathered in Washington, D.C., at a May 3 reunion of radical  May Day  anti-war leaders.The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained a copy of the letter at the meeting.Binh, now age 90, originally served as the highest ranking Vietnamese delegate to the Paris Peace Talks that imposed a ceasefire in the country in 1973.The  Vietcong  was a ragtag group of communist guerrillas who were allied with the official communist government in North Vietnam. The country was cut in two in 1954, with the south seeking to build a democratic state allied to the West.Binh s frank admission highlights a secret side of the communist s effective lobbying influence in the United States. Rather than live in the southern part of the country, which for decades she represented as a diplomat, it appears after the war Binh was living in Hanoi, the original capital of North Vietnam.In her letter, she extolled the American anti-war movement, saying it was  a key component  that advanced the communist takeover of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people have great appreciation for the peace and antiwar movements in the United States and view those movements  contribution as important in shortening the war,  she wrote and which was read to an assembled group of  May Day  anti-war activists in Washington, D.C.The  May Day tribe  consisted of thousands of radical anti-war protesters bent on shutting down Washington, D.C., in May 1971 through three days of massive civil disobedience. More than 12,000 protesters were arrested, for filling the streets to block feds from getting to work.The Nixon administration was so fearful of violence against federal employees, it deployed 5,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division and thousands more from the Marine Corps barracks to protect the 14th Street Bridge, a major thoroughfare into the nation s capital from Virginia.The protesters rallying cry was,  if the government won t stop the war, we ll stop the government. The war temporarily ended in 1973 when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed that imposed a ceasefire on all parties.That ceasefire was abruptly broken in 1975, however, when the North Vietnamese forces launched a surprise  Spring Offensive. Leading the offensive were hundreds of T-54 and T-55 heavy Russian tanks that left secret sanctuaries in neighboring Cambodia and flooded into South Vietnam. Regular North Vietnamese troops spearheaded the offensive, along with guerrillas tied to the Vietcong, which also called themselves the National Liberation Front of Vietnam.By the time the Russian tanks were about to drive into Saigon, a liberal Congress filled with anti-war lawmakers already had hamstrung their South Vietnamese allies. Congress cut military aid to Saigon by 50 percent and handcuffed the South Vietnamese military facing the communist onslaught by barring any U.S. air support or other meaningful military assistance to the government.The offensive was relatively quick, trapping hundreds of thousands of pro-American Vietnamese troops and millions of civilians who had trusted Washington and openly supported the United States.The lasting images of those dark, chaotic days were captured by American news networks, which showed the panic in the capital city.Harrowing pictures depicted U.S. helicopters frantically trying to ferry thousands of panic-stricken Vietnamese citizens and U.S. officials off the roof of the American Embassy. The videos depicted Vietnamese clinging from helicopters in a desperate effort to escape the onrushing communist army.The defeat ultimately triggered an international humanitarian crisis where at least 800,000 Vietnamese  boat people  fled their communist conquerors. Many bravely undertook perilous journeys in small boats across the Gulf of Thailand to escape the new communist warlords. An unknown number of refugees drowned in the exodus.After the communists defeated the South Vietnamese army, more than 1 million South Vietnamese citizens who had supported the United States were left behind and imprisoned in  re-education camps.  About 100,000 faced summary execution by the communist victors.Bill Cowan, who was a Purple Heart Marine platoon leader in Vietnam, told TheDCNF that U.S. troops were demoralized when the U.S. media only highlighted anti-war protesters and not the heroism of many of the Vietnamese who were trying to keep their country free. The media fueled the anti-war movement, empowering the protestors, the North Vietnamese, and the Vietcong,  he told TheDCNF. It was rare to have a  good news  story about what was happening there,  Cowan said. I recall a reporter coming to interview me at the village I was living at and apologizing after she was done by saying,  You know, this story will probably never see the light of day. My editors will quash it because it has too many good things in here about what you guys are doing.  Cowan told TheDCNF.Fred Rustmann, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was deployed in Vietnam for two years and later assigned to cover the Paris Peace Talks where Binh was the chief Vietcong delegate, called her  a great propagandist. She was really the propaganda arm of the Vietcong. And she was very effective. She was living in a villa in Paris in the southern suburbs, which was a very communist, socialist neighborhood,  Rustmann told TheDCNF in an interview. He said ironically Binh spent more time in Paris than in Vietnam.In Paris,  she was regularly interviewing with leftist news organization. She had these leftist kids and try to influence them. I believe she met several times with Jane Fonda. Binh actually recalled in her latest letter many meetings she had with American anti-war activists. She wrote,  The first time I met representatives of the American anti-war movement was at a week-long conference held in Bratislava in 1967, with the attendees of about forty Americans. Before parting, we were shaking hands, holding hands,  she recalled in her letter, adding,  During the war years, I also met many other Americans in different places organized by U.S. citizen groups opposed to the war. Obama visited Vietnam last week for a three-day trip, and hailed its communist leadership and downplayed the human rights problems that persist.Hours before Air Force One touched down, Vietnam had scheduled national  elections  for its one-party National Assembly. Reminiscent of previous old communist regimes from the Soviet Union days, the state-run press reported that 98.77 percent of the public  voted  in the election.Only one sentence in Obama s main speech to the Vietnamese public made any reference to human rights problems in the country.Vietnamese government officials also blocked dissidents from meeting with Obama or his advisers when the American delegation arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said it shows the meeting was  the source of significant discomfort  for Vietnam s rulers.

22523,DALLAS “ATTACK” DIALECTICS: Summer of Uncle Sam,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAs the recent events (and subsequent incoherent media narratives) in Dallas continue to unravel, familiar patterns have already emerged that once again paint a now familiar picture of large-scale planning. We are now expected to believe this highly coordinated, professional  sniper  operation, whose numbers and details have now significantly changed, were conducted by the likes of a former vet and unknown accomplices for the purposes of targeting  white people,  and in particular, police.The new Judge Dredd-style execution by Robot! Doesn t this all sound like a scripted move?Immediately given the symbolic title  Michael X to affiliate the suspect with Malcolm X, the entire scenario, from the revised proclamation of cell terrorist to  lone wolf,  now smells of sub-par Hollywood script-writing   especially the ludicrous climax of  hidden IEDs  followed by police deploying a bomb-carrying Robocop R2D2-like executioner as the only rational means of finally halting the crazed assassin.As we will see, the event also echoes prior known false flags and staged scenarios, as well as fitting a general pattern of Soros-style color revolutions and agitation propaganda, on top of the fact that the evolving official story is preposterous.While it may appear contradictory at first glance, the notion that such an event could fit the  progressive  mold of a color revolution is not far-fetched.Consortium News details numerous Soros-funded groups that have called for soft-power coups and regime changes through numerous fronts that include  social justice  causes, as well as right-wing groups like  Right Sektor  in the Ukraine. 21stCenturyWire comments: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as Micah X to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event) a military-trained marksman and US Army veteran was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a robot carrying a bomb. Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed safe for the public to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7/7 ala London 7/7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7/7 was the police s  worst loss since  9/11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event. Hollywood dramas that go live!Ukraine is of particular significance given the similarities between the false flag scenario of the Maidan sniper and the 7/7 purported racially-motivated event in Dallas. For both Right Sektor s Ukrainian Nationalists and Black Lives Matter s Alinsky-style Revolutionary there is a similar modus operandi of background financing and manipulation. In a piece I authored last year, I compared these similar tactics and discussed the think tank and  soft power  meta-strategy involved in geopolitical re-engineering, both domestically and abroad.Keep in mind that according to even mainstream fixture The New York Times most  terror plots  are hatched and aided by the FBI. The Soros-style NGO and soft power approach has seen the aiding of both far left and far right with the overall intent of duping progressives into war.  I wrote concerning NGOs and think tanks identity politics  and radicalization, an international operation for  change  being engineered out of New York: In the case of black youth, the Occupy-style thug culture of hip hop and rap easily combines with the radical Jihadism of intelligence agency creations like ISIS.  Both groups share a similar sense of being oppressed minorities, and both are utilized as foolish dupes of the same western establishment, dancing according to the whims of their foundation puppeteer masters.In case you were wondering, this is how the foundations and think tanks provoke minority groups with similar, but rebranded ideologies of invented revolution, particularly through the mainstream (and alternative) news cycle s scientifically precise emotionally manipulative stories that are intentionally chosen, crafted, cropped and created for the foundation/think tank revolutionary agenda.Patsies and provocateurs.This same technique is now being used for gender as a whole, as feminism,  women s rights,   gender rights,  equality, etc., now make up a large portion of the total news feed.  Increasingly taking on a clickbait style, the endless gender oppression articles are another technology for social re-engineering under the guise of appealing to the female populace.Females are undeniably more susceptible to emotional appeals and advertising deception, the same marketing styles of ad campaigns for endless hygiene products now mirrors the mindless, gender-based  stories  of oppressed trans teens and eternally victimized and  oppressed  western women (who have the highest living standards in the world).  While western women conduct their war on the patriarchal power by sharing these retarded stories on their iPads, they are just as much the dupes of the same foundation/think tank techniques as the low IQ ISIS  recruits  and the ghetto mobs.On the other side of the dialectic are the equally duped  right wingers  who still champion the Bush Dynasty and so-called American  freedoms,  the great envy of all the world that must be protected at all costs from an absolutely impossible, fabricated foreign invasion by ISIS. Constituting the new boogey-man in the patriot/tea party mythos, the invasion of the western intelligence created and backed  ISIS  is the phony  bad man  parallels the phony bad man  of the thugs (the 1%, which is actually anyone middle class), and the bad man  of the narcissistic American female, the patriarchy.All of these  bad men  are invented bad men, manufactured and created by the foundations and think tanks to manipulate your specific population niche.  The establishment has recruited and used dumb, low IQ, prison-convert, Muslim mind-controlled bots for decades, just as the system has used dumb, low IQ females as poster children for  gender revolution. The  Sniper  Effect Unknown Snipers  are a classic tactic of Western-influenced regime changes, including Romania in 1989 in regard to Ceaucescu, which is particularly relevant to our situation, as the coup there involved a revolt against police.  Sniper death squads in Romania aided by western intelligence would thus be a perfect parallel to anti-police engineered  sniping  in Dallas.Other events where snipers were involved in regime change and staged agitprop include the  Arab Spring,  Yeltsin s counter-government in 1993, Venezuela in 2002, Thailand in 2010, and more recently, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Libya and Syria.  Supposed unknown snipers, like terrorists, provide a useful function for existing regimes or foreign powers to conveniently concoct and steer events by pinning blame on patsies.Same strategy of controlled, radical opposition in a game of obvious dialectics.Like Operation Gladio where from the 50s to the 80s, left-wing  radicals  were blamed for Euro-terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of NATO intelligence and P-2 affiliated masonry lodge, similar patterns are seen in today s  terror cells  and  lone wolf shooters.  Some wondered why I originally mentioned the masonic apparel in the original post, but this is because Gladio used P-2 and secret societies can function as networks for organizing and arranging provocateurs, much like the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS.  In short, sniping events, just like  false flags,  are run by and advantageous to the state, not lone wolves and terror cells.Indeed, it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically, with the FBI-hatched terror plots. Terror in these instances functions to exacerbate a  strategy of tension  to smear opposition, promote undue fear, and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater.  Dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of  conspiracy theorist  James Boulware, a  lone wolf shooter  who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings (which are quite clearly manufactured), and now we are told Micah X has a  manifesto    a must have for your daily shooter starter pack.Highly dubious James Boulware Dallas  Shooting Fusion  DrillsAs noted in my original video, at least two large-scale, multi-agency DHS supervised  fusion  drills in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area preceded the 7/7 event by only a week.  One drill even included  three shooters and bombs,  a narrative now fed into the mainstream media concerning the Dallas sniping event. Given every major terror event of recent recollection has been preceded by a drill of the same scenario, it should be obvious to question the Dallas event, as it fits the same patterns as prior  terror. The familiar narrative of Dallas now includes  IEDs  hidden in mysterious locales, a dubious claim inserted into the narrative of James Holmes   booby-trapped  apartment, for example.  The date and locale for the event is also suspicious, being in the vicinity of the JFK assassination as well as on the anniversary of the London 7/7 bombing, another staged event.We are supposed to believe  Micah X  learned his sniping and IED skills in the military and subsequently coordinated a professional hit man operation to target random white police over the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling that occurred that day!  Mass media claimed the supposed shooter was angry about events that transpired that day, and subsequently had time to perform reconnaissance and establish sniper spots for that day s Black Lives Matter Protest.Lunacy does not end there, as the standoff with police then involved the preposterous claim of utilizing and  bomb-bot  to blow the suspect up, as he supposedly refused to cooperate.  Are bomb-bots now standard procedure?  Were the mainstream narrative of this event true (and it certainly is not), wouldn t law enforcement choose to gas the subject or subdue him, to gather information about his so-called terror cell?  Instead, the public was fed a fantastical Robocop storyline to add tabloid juice to this manufactured event, as we have seen in so many.Patsies, dupes and provocateurs. Black power  groups are notorious for being infiltrated by federal agents and provocateurs, and the New Black Panther Party is a shining example.  Allowed to consistently call for the death of all whites (which is illegal), this fake front group is allowed to continue to agitate and play on public fears, like other  terror groups  and racial identity movements.  Like the KKK or Elohim City and McVeigh, the black power and Nation of Islam movements have been exposed as phony government fronts many times, often identified by their outlandish and outrageous calls for violence.Most famously, this was seen in the COINTELPRO operation, with FBI informant Richard Aoki arming the Black Panthers to make them appear distastefully radical.Photo-op. Patty Hearst and the theatrical SLA  abduction. The Saul Alinsky-style approach of manufacturing radicals for self-destructive social  change  that marks this event also has precedent in two other previously contrived  terror  attacks: The Alinsky-inspired Bill Ayers Weather Underground event, and Patty Hearst SLA staging.  Both events were manufactured operations that served to solidify mass opinion against anti-war movements, while the SLA event (in which reportedly 6 died, while Patty Hearst was not even in the building) became the basis for America s adoption of SWAT teams   the Hearst soap opera kidnapping was even followed by a television show called  SWAT  that aided in the rise of America s acceptance of the  Warrior Cop. This fact, as well as the long-term federalization of local police refutes the faux right-wing narrative that Obama and company are  anti-cop. Seen in this light, the Dallas event is ably summed up in its effectiveness for the establishment by Patrick Henningsen: The Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an us against them dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist. Pop culture promotion of supposed anti-establishment agitation and  revolution.  In reality, it is top-down social engineering and psychological warfare.Given the government admission that much of modern history has been manipulated and contrived through false flags and staged events, is it sensible to take the Dallas event at face value?  We are constantly reminded in every terror  event to  never forget  9/11, but a much more apt recollection would be to never forget the admissions and examples of fake and staged news, as well as individuals who supposedly die in three separate  terror  events being still alive show the lunacy of the fact there is no law or regulation upon the government and private infotainment news agencies barring them from manufacturing events.  Rather, the pattern 21Wire recognized and exposed in the recent Andrews Air Force Base s phony  live shooter  drill-gone-live scenario serves as the exemplary form of how these events are engineered   especially given the drills preceding the 7/7 Dallas event.Naturally, the  alt right  will seize upon the event as proof of a racial attack, but this simply plays into the establishment s desire for a helter skelter  race war and a  summer of chaos,  all of which was prepared for symbolically through Beyonc s militant  Black Panther  Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February.  The  race war  is not fought with bats and maces in the streets, but through the toxic culture itself with its insidious programming for each racial group.As we have seen in past events,  gun control  is once again the unanimous cacophony, while the labeling of  Black Lives Matter  as a  terrorist  group only serves to set further precedence for anyone critical of the establishment as an  extremist  or  terrorist.

17528,SENATOR GILLIBRAND Pulled Strings So Muslim Athlete Who Molested 12-Year Old Girl Could Come To U.S. After His Visa Was Denied,"Democrat Senator Kristen Gillibrand (NY) likes to think of herself as a champion of women. After multiple women came forward to accuse fellow Democrat Senator Al Franken of sexual assault (photos were also supplied as evidence of one of the accuser s claims), Gillibrand finally called for Franken to step down. Was Gillibrand s call for her fellow Senator to step down part of a larger plan to appear neutral, as she then attacked President Donald Trump for unfounded allegations against him only months before the election?  Isn t it kind of hypocritical for Gillibrand to call anyone out of sexual misconduct after she fought to bring a Muslim athlete to upstate New York who molested an innocent 12-year old girl while he was in America?The media CHEERED when NY Democrat Senator s Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer helped a 24-yr old Muslim man enter the U.S. after he was denied entry The media was strangely SILENT, however, after he molested a 12-yr-old upstate NY girl while she was with her family at an event celebrating the Muslim athlete. Yesterday, it was discovered that the Islamic extremist who killed 9 people and injured dozens of others, when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in New York City, entered our country on a  Diversity visa  that was the brainchild of none other than the Democrat Senator from NY, Chuck (I always put diversity before our nation s security) Schumer An Indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of U.S. lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the World Snowshoe Championship in New York has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor.It was a long journey for Indian snowshoe champion Hussain and his coach to the World Snowshoe Championships in Saranac Lake, New York last weekend.The US embassy in New Delhi rejected Tanveer Hussain s application for a visa so he could compete in the World Snowshoe Championship last month, Fox News reported.Local officials then appealed for help to Schumer and Gillibrand, and their offices reached out to the New Delhi embassy, which let Hussain successfully reapply for a visa.Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, an outspoken opponent of President Trump s position on stricter immigration policies for immigrants and visa holders coming into the United States, bragged about getting around Trump s temporary travel restrictions to bring convicted pedophile Tanveer Hussain to New York on his Facebook page:Schumer s office told Fox he often intervenes to help international competitions. As we often do when local communities ask for help, at the request of Saranac Lake we helped to navigate the visa process so these athletes could compete at a local competition. The charges against one member of the group, who is accused of a serious crime and abusing our visa program, are extremely troubling. If he s found guilty, he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,  a rep said.Gillibrand s office offered a similar response, adding that the charges are  extremely serious. Hussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. Although India is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States was turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.   National PostTanveer Hussain was indicted in August 2017, by an Essex County grand jury for allegedly having inappropriate contact with a 12-year-old Saranac Lake girl earlier this year.Tanveer is pictured below surrounded by young teenagers at Saranac Middle School. Taneer is pictured in center-left with his arms around a young girl.The grand jury returned the indictment charging Tanveer Hussain with one count of first-degree sexual abuse and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, a report in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise quoted a press release from Essex County District Attorney Kristy Sprague as saying.The reckless and irresponsible acts of Democrat legislators like Senator Chuck Schumer, perfectly illustrates why Trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants.Hussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying.

5659," Bill Maher Brutally Mocks Trump On Facebook, Hilarity Ensues (SCREENSHOTS)","Donald trump is lonely these days. Several prominent conservatives and other assorted right-wing loonies have decided that Trump is just a bit too insane and racist for them to associate with. The Koch brothers, Mia Love, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and a rapidly growing list of figures representing the Stupid Part of America have bowed out, refusing to share a building with their nominee.Trump has trouble getting anyone to attend, let along speak at his convention. Everyone has to make their own choice, but at this point, 70 percent of the American public doesn t like Donald Trump. That s as toxic as we ve seen in American politics,  said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist who was partially responsible for the 2012 GOP convention. Normally, people want to speak at national conventions. It launched Barack Obama s political career. Naturally, the repulsion felt by Trump s own party is too much for comedian Bill Maher to resist. Friday morning, Maher decided to poke a bit of fun at The Donald. Wow  # Trump  cant get anyone to show up at his convention!  Maher said.  I m sure this isn t the first time he hasn t been able to make someone come. Goodnight! Then the denizens of Facebook joined in, having quite a bit of fun at Trump s expense:          Unfortunately for Trump, they re probably all right. Not only is the 2016 GOP nominee encountering difficulties getting people to  come  to his convention, he has tiny hands and tiny other stuff that he felt the need to embarrass the country by spending months offering defenses for them. Since he is a detestable, orange, racist xenophobe with a penchant for douchebaggery, he probably didn t do the other thing either.Unfortunately, it seems like Trump is not going to be successful in unifying his party or pleasing a woman at any point in the near future.

12991,SCOUNDREL HILLARY SUPPORTER STARTS “TrumpLeaks” Campaign…Desperate Move!,"Hillary Clinton ally David Brock is offering to pay for new information on Donald Trump, hoping that damaging audio or video on the Republican presidential candidate will be submitted to his super PAC.Brock, founder of the left-wing Media Matters and operator of Correct the Record super PAC, recently posted the plea on Correct the Record s website and is referring to the project as  TrumpLeaks,  NBC News reported.Brock asked for video or audio of Trump that has yet to be released. One of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of a candidate s views, ideas, and temperament over time,  the website states. In making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. There are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended. Brock s super PAC goes on to say they can offer compensation to anyone who has new video or audio that has been obtained legally.Read more: WFB",politics,"Sep 17, 2016",brock information trump audio video candidate pac brock founder left media operator record super pac plea record project news brock video audio trump election measure candidate temperament time choice president public world regard access form television radio video candidate brock pac compensation anyone video audio
1529, BOMBSHELL: FBI Admits They Are Directly Investigating Donald Trump,"Donald Trump thanked outgoing FBI Director James Comey for informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,  but it seems that The Donald is lying. The shocking firing of the man who was investigating Trump came just after the former FBI chief requested additional resources for the investigation  a sign that things were not going well for Trump and his accomplices. But you know what else is a sign that things aren t going well? The FBI just confirmed that they are investigating Trump directly despite his claims to the contrary.An open records request from The Sparrow Project reveals that there is an  active ongoing investigation  into Trump. The organization requested disclosure of any and all records, including investigative records, mentioning or referring to Donald J. Trump s statement on 27 July, 2016 [regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton s State Department emails],  Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,  and  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. The FBI dragged its heels on the request, prompting a lawsuit demanding that the FOIA request be fulfilled. The Bureau had initially refused to confirm nor deny the existence of any records related to the request, but that changed in the agency s legal response, which confirms an  active, ongoing investigation  and says the FBI is concerned that any release could  reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. It s worth noting that the requested records were not related to Trump s associates or Russian accomplices   the request solely related to him and his demand that Russia hack Hillary Clinton.Things are bad for the Russia administration   and they are only going to get much worse after Trump s attempt to interfere with the investigation.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"May 10, 2017",trump director investigation firing man trump chief investigation sign trump sign request sparrow project ongoing investigation trump organization disclosure trump statement secretary state department press request lawsuit demanding request bureau existence request agency response ongoing investigation release enforcement request demand hack russia administration trump attempt investigation image
23319,"MISSING DETAILS: Orlando Shooting 911 Transcripts Questioned, Survivor’s Story Challenged","Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire The FBI have finally released the written transcripts from shooter Omar Mateen s supposed 911 call   and now apparently unredacted. Meanwhile, another story of survival at Pulse nightclub is called into question.Will this tell us anything new about this event, or will it just prompt even more questions? NIGHT OF TERROR?   A serene setting following the Orlando shooting attack on June 11th (Image Source: twitter)Shaky Storyline, Missing DetailsWhile the focus on Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s 911 transcripts is over what was included and what was not, and while the national media argue endlessly over the need for more gun control in the US   the most important aspect of the FBI supplied transcript seems to have gone virtually unnoticed. There s no discussion of an actual shooting occurring inside of the Pulse nightclub.While the report has a basic outline of  America s largest mass shooting  it fails to account for any of the shootings said to have occurred within the Pulse nightclub, with no mention of individuals being shot at or reportedly shot at in the FBI s official narrative. It s as if they just left out the biggest piece of the puzzle.This has become an all to common theme, as media press conference rituals shape a narrative within the first hours of a mass casualty event and even if that story turns out to be mostly false, the media runs with it anyway, whether or not law enforcement information and crime scene analysis belies the original narrative pushed by media. The most clear example of this happened during the aftermath of the WTC 1993 bombing, where major media outlets exposed it as an FBI run sting with their operators in control   yet still, media anchors called it an al-Qaeda led attack.So when you consider what happened in Orlando, one should question the lack of shooting details- why is this aspect of the story left open for interpretation when every other part of the official timeline appears to be accounted for?While the media conveniently overlook this important detail, the implications of this could be very significant in determining who shot who, and when.Interestingly, the description of the Orlando shooting even includes mention of the Orlando Police Department pulling an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse  dressing room  to evacuate victims, a multi-call crisis negotiation, the alleged shooter s outrageous claims of a  bomb-laced vest  and authorities breaching the back wall of the nightclub with an explosive charge   and yet, no mention of additional shots fired at patrons inside the club?Here s a portion of the FBI s summary of events that excludes any mention of shots fired within the interior of the club itself: Based on OPD radio communications, there were no reports of shots being fired inside Pulse between the initial exchange of gunfire between responding officers and shooter, and the time of the final breach. During this time, the shooter communicated with an OPD 911 operator and an OPD crisis negotiator, and OPD radio communications reported that victims were being rescued. Here s a more basic chronology of the Orlando shooting, as told by the FBI: 2:02 a.m.: OPD call transmitted multiple shots fired at Pulse nightclub. 2:04 a.m.: Additional OPD officers arrived on scene. 2:08 a.m.: Officers from various law enforcement agencies made entrance to Pulse and engaged the shooter. 2:18 a.m.: OPD SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) initiated a full call-out. 2:35 a.m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse.3:03 a.m.: Second crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately 16 minutes. 3:24 a.m.: Third crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately three minutes.4:21 a.m.: OPD pulled an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse dressing room window for victims to evacuate.4:29 a.m.: As victims were being rescued, they told OPD the shooter said he was going to put four vests with bombs on victims within 15 minutes.5:02 a.m.: OPD SWAT and OCSO Hazardous Device Team began to breach wall with explosive charge and armored vehicle to make entry.5:14 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that shots were fired. 5:15 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that OPD engaged the suspect and the suspect was reported down. The Orlando shooting details state multiple shots [were] fired at Pulse nightclub at 2:02 am, as Additional OPD officers arrived on scene,  at 2:04 am, with law enforcement engaging the shooter at 2:08 am   there is no other mention of shots fired until police exchange fire with the alleged suspect after breaching the wall at 5:15 am.Question: Would it really be possible for Mateen to have accurately shot over 100 people, take hostages and engage in a fire fight with officers in just a 6 minute time frame?This scenario is hardly likely, if not impossible.Additionally, what happened during the apparent crisis negotiation from 3:24 am to 4:21 am, why have the FBI chosen not to elaborate on those details?Matten s weapons of choice during the apparent attack were a Sig Sauer MCX .223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistol    and according to the official story, was far more accurate than most well-trained law enforcement agents, defying statistical averages as examined by the Rand Corporation.Let s take another look at the extensive Rand study involving the NYPD, here are the following statistics as it relates they firearm accuracy: According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training, between 1998 and 2006, the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent . When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time.Another aspect of the Orlando shooting attack was the possibility that many club goers could have been injured by authorities, something that also seemed to be absent from the official story. Here s a passage from WFAA8, an ABC affiliate discussing this point: Orlando Police Chief John Mina and other law enforcement officers offered new details about the shooting, including the possibility that some victims may have been killed by officers trying to save them. I will say this, that s all part of the investigation,  Mina said.  But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, the backdrop was a concrete wall, and they were being fired upon. Police also used an explosive charge and a Bearcat armored vehicle to breach the wall as civilians were allegedly holed up in a bathroom. This has led some critics to consider the possibility that non-combatants could have become collateral damage during the SWAT siege at Pulse.Political Fallout & Media EngineeringAlso of note regarding the Orlando shooting event, was the obvious attempt to ramrod new ready-made gun legislation (struck down just two days ago)   just over a week after the incident.Back in November of 2012, it was reported that the White House, along with other Democrats were already busy rewriting old gun-ban legislation just prior to the Sandy Hook shooting. The Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2007, otherwise known as H.R. 1022 of the 110th Congress, it introduced an early list of gun-bans and restrictions but was dropped due to lack of public support. A similar set of laws failed after the Oregon campus shooting in 2015.While big media has been busy trying to sell the public on the most tragic shooting in America. They ve also been attempting to fill in a series of unexplainable blanks by seemingly re-writing the Orlando narrative, with a wave of contradictory information. In essence, the corporate media has boiled down two choices in the motive for the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting   suggesting it s either a hate crime or terrorism.And since then it s become problematic to blend certain elements of the official story in the Orlando shooting case, prompting Attorney General Loretta Lynch to state the motive may never be known in the alleged crime   after key aspects of the 911 transcript were redacted and a decision was made to block audio from the 911 call.No motive, no audio, redacted transcripts and conflicting reports of the shooting, isn t that convenient.The whole episode immediately recalls the much fabled death of Bin Laden and the political and media fiasco that followed the Abbotabad raid in Pakistan   all of which failed to reveal any real forensic evidence, as President Obama withheld post-mortem images of Bin Laden, including  video  of the sea burial of the purported terror leader.The fact is, none of the media s grandstanding or politicized hyperbole has offered anything in terms of actual evidence   as the public has been deliberately steered towards multiple storylines   while politicians go through another gun control/gun reform ritual on the Senate floor.  QUIET EMERGENCY?    A calm scene at Orlando Regional Medical Center hospital prior to apparent Pulse nightclub victims arriving for medical attention. (Image Source: twitter)Orlando s Staged Elements & False ClaimsRecently here at 21WIRE, we discussed much of the corporate media s theatrical depiction of the Orlando shooting and the widespread characterization of the event, which has been reduced to two categories   that of a  lone gunman  and a saddened community centered on the sociopolitical ramifications of the incident, rather than an in-depth forensic analysis of the alleged crime itself.In addition, we outlined some of the various Hollywood and media connections observed in the aftermath of the apparent Orlando shooting attack, as it was revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is also client of the mass casualty and crisis actor staging company called CrisisCast.As if that wasn t enough, we re also now being told that alleged Pulse nightclub  survivor  Clint Lampkin s account of the shooting has been called into question by media. The following is a YouTube clip from Wochit news reviewing the inconsistencies found by the CBS-affiliated television station WHNT-TV The following was released by FOX6 on June 21st, examining WHNT-TV s findings over the weekend that have since been removed from the network s website: On Saturday, hundreds of people in Alabama were captivated by an impromptu speech by Clint Lampkin, a man who claimed to be a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. I was in the bar when it all happened,  Lampkin told the crowd at the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service in Huntsville.  It s been hard on me  seeing people get shot. Lampkin said the hate he witnessed first-hand is still overwhelming. It s really strong. I mean not just for my friend but all the others that lost their lives. It s hard you know. It really is. It s really sad,  Lampkin says.Continuing, the recently published article outlined the contradictory nature of Lampkin s comments made during a memorial service and a Facebook post on his personal account on the morning after the shooting:(Left side screen shot of Lampkin s strange comment after the Orlando attack) But now, Lampkin s story is being called into question.One of Lampkin s Facebook friends sent WHNT a screenshot of one of Lampkin s Facebook posts from June 12, which shows he shared the story about the shooting and wrote:  Glad I wasn t at that one. Lampkin told WHNT his Facebook account was  hacked  and that he never made that post. He still claims he was at the Pulse Nightclub the night of the shooting. I have really bad anxiety attacks, so I just kinda, I don t know, my mind is just gone,  he told WHNT.WHNT asked for other details surrounding the night of the shooting, and Lampkin gave the same response   that the trauma he witnessed has somehow erased his memory and made it difficult to remember the name of the friend who was allegedly shot dead: I did lose a friend that got shot,  he told the crowd on Saturday. WHNT asked Lampkin for the name of his friend who died inside the club. He answered that he had only known each other for a short time and didn t remember the victim s name.  Lampkin s Facebook profile states that he s an associate at Tobacco Warehouse and a cashier at Arby s. CEO of Free2Be and organizer of the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service, James Robinson, has subsequently fielded calls claiming Lampkin s story is untrue.This again has become another unexplained and unresolved aspect in the Orlando shooting event.Rehearsal Drills Train the PublicThe staging of inter-agency drills often precedes an area stricken by a tragic event. Here at 21WIRE, we ve documented a number of drills taking place in the days, months, years, in a nearby city leading up to a dramatic mass casualty incident.As we previously reported Orlando s Orange County had been running a number of  mass casualty  drills in recent years.As stated before, these emergency response drills often take place prior to a real-life active-shooter scenario. The Orlando Sentinel reported the drill on October 2nd, 2015, one day after the Oregon shooting, an event that also saw drills prior to a shooting at Umpqua Community College. Here s a passage of the Sentinel s report: During the Emergency Nurses Association s annual meeting on Friday, a mock shooter blew himself up, killing and injuring 100 local volunteer actors. There was blood, screams and moans, wounds and dead people   all fake   to create a realistic training environment for more than 40 nurses who had signed up for the exercise.They quickly began tending to  patients,  assessing the extent of their injuries. The  NBC-affiliated WESH2 in Orlando stated that  Nurses attending to mock patients knew they were in for a drill, but they had no idea it would be a mass casualty/active shooter test. Was the Pulse nightclub shooting a drill gone live, with both real and unreal elements?  HEAVY MAKE-UP    In another plot twist, an alleged ex-lover of Mateen s named  Miguel  has re-energized the hate crime narrative pushed by media.(Image Source: xaluan)According left-leaning latin American broadcast TV outlet Univision: Omar Mateen, the Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was  100 percent  gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months. I ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,  he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish on Tuesday. He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, he said:  It s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man. The man said he had approached by the FBI and been interviewed three times in person by agents. Univision was unable to independently verify his account. The FBI confirmed to Univision that it had met with him. Suddenly, the alleged shooter Omar Mateen is a gay lover scorned, and not an ISIS-inspired terrorist? Note here that  Miguel  could be seen wearing a very expensive, complex Hollywood-level make-up facade, and one could easily deduce here that  Miguel  is an actor of sorts, if not a professional.It should also be noted that Univision, who collaborate heavily with CNN on a number of sensational and politicized stories, led the way in spoiling the crime scene of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen s apartment in Orlando   accessing his property and fiddling with the suspects belongs on camera only days after the Pulse nightclub event. This media segment was clearly staged, not least of all because at that time law enforcement announced they were conducting a  terrorism  and mass-murder investigation. If that were the case, then the suspect s home would have been classed as a crime scene and its contents considered as evidence.Judging by Univision s immediate media access to the property, it should be fairly obvious, as it was after the exact same San Bernardino media fiasco last December, that the apartment would not have been deemed a real crime scene in an international or domestic terrorism investigation. Watch: For over a week, the public has been drip fed information about the Orlando shooting attack   much of which has led to even more questions. To major media, the event is all but a forgone conclusion tightly wrapped up with all the fear-inducing talking points on both the left and right side of the political aisle without clearly looking at the alleged crime itself.In fact it seems, that the media has sought to draw the viewer away from the incomplete Pulse nightclub story line, a narrative that as of yet   has failed to explain the connection of a crisis staging company (CrisisCast) to that of the alleged shooter s security company (G4S), as well as many Hollywood/acting/media connections discovered, such as Luis Burbano, Shawn Royster Santiago, Patience Carter, Omar Mateen, Francesca Hunt and Brian Mitchell   add to that, those who witnessed multiple shooters or any shooting within the interior of the nightclub, in addition to the mismatched tweets and Facebook posts that displayed inaccurate time frames or cult of personality types such as Clint Lampkin, whose story just doesn t add up.We re now told that the FBI is continuing to build a timeline of Mateen s whereabouts before the attack, stating he paid for entry at Pulse then subsequently disappeared for a two-hour period between when he left the club and returned. It s anyone s guess what will be next in the Orlando shooting story.END OF PART 3Stay tuned for more Orlando shooting updates SEE ALSO: CASTING CRISIS: Orlando s Actors, Agents and Casualty Role PlayersREAD MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 22, 2016",century wire shooter call story survival question anything event night terror setting attack june image source twitter focus shooter media need gun control aspect transcript discussion shooting pulse report outline mass mention shot piece puzzle theme media press conference narrative mass casualty event story media law enforcement information crime scene analysis media example aftermath media run control media lack aspect story interpretation part media detail description mention police department air unit dressing room call crisis negotiation shooter bomb wall charge mention club portion summary mention interior club radio pulse exchange gunfire shooter time breach time shooter operator crisis negotiator radio chronology shooting call scene law enforcement entrance shooter tactics call shooter operator crisis negotiation call crisis negotiation call air unit dressing room window shooter swat device team wall charge vehicle entry radio communication radio communication suspect suspect state scene law enforcement shooter mention police exchange fire suspect wall question people fire fight minute time frame scenario crisis negotiation choice attack caliber rifle auto pistol story law enforcement rand corporation look rand study statistics accuracy rand corporation study york police department firearm training rate percent fire police percent time aspect attack possibility club something story passage affiliate point police chief mina law enforcement shooting possibility part investigation mina swat backdrop wall police charge vehicle wall bathroom possibility damage siege media note event attempt legislation days week incident house gun ban legislation hook assault ban law enforcement protection act congress list gun support set campus media public shooting series wave contradictory information essence media motive pulse hate crime terrorism story case attorney lynch state motive crime transcript decision audio call audio episode death bin laden media raid evidence president withheld post bin video sea burial terror leader fact none media hyperbole anything evidence public towards gun control gun reform ritual senate floor emergency scene center hospital attention image source twitter media depiction shooting characterization event lone gunman community incident depth analysis crime addition media aftermath attack world security firm man pulse client mass casualty crisis actor company survivor clint account shooting question media following clip news television station following june weekend network people impromptu speech clint man survivor pulse bar crowd rocket city service people hate hand friend article nature service post account morning shooting shot comment attack story question june story shooting glad account post pulse night shooting anxiety mind night shooting response trauma memory name friend friend crowd name friend club time victim name profile associate tobacco warehouse cashier organizer rocket city service story aspect event rehearsal staging inter agency area event number place days city mass casualty incident orange county number mass casualty emergency response place life shooter scenario sentinel drill day event shooting community college passage sentinel report emergency association meeting mock shooter volunteer blood wounds people training environment exercise extent drill idea mass casualty shooter test drill plot twist ex lover hate crime media image source broadcast outlet gunman pulse massacre percent gay grudge men man lover idea thing truth terrorism opinion revenge interview man sex virus story responsibility citizen gay man man times person account shooter lover note level facade actor number way crime scene shooter apartment property fiddling camera days pulse event media segment time law enforcement terrorism mass murder investigation case suspect home crime scene contents evidence media access property san media fiasco apartment crime scene terrorism investigation watch week public information media event conclusion fear left side aisle crime fact media pulse story line connection crisis company shooter security company media patience carter hunt shooting interior addition time cult personality clint story whereabouts attack entry hour period club anyone guess story end part shooting crisis casualty role news century wire member
9075,POLITICS FIRST: LEFTIST PARENTS Of Former Combat Marine Running For GOP Senate Seat Max Out Donations To His DEMOCRAT Opponent,"The heartbreaking story of two parents who put their leftist ideology before their own son The parents of GOP Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson have maxed out their campaign contributions to the Democrat he s challenging, CNN reported Monday.Each of Nicholson s parents gave $2,700 to Sen. Tammy Baldwin s (D-Wis.) campaign in December, the largest amount they can give during the Democratic primary.Nicholson s mother, Donna, has been documented as giving thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years. However, this is the first gift either of his parents have made to Baldwin s campaign since Nicholson announced his own bid. My parents have a different worldview than I do, and it is not surprising that they would support a candidate like Tammy Baldwin who shares their perspective,  Nicholson said in a statement to CNN. I m a conservative today not because I was born one, but because of the experience I earned as a Marine in combat, my experience as a husband and father, my choice to be a Christian, the schools I chose to attend and the decision to pursue the career that I have,  he continued. Regardless of who may disagree with my life decisions, I would not trade these experiences for anything, and they will always guide my views as Wisconsin s next U.S. Senator. Nicholson announced in July that he would be running in the GOP primary for Baldwin s seat.He faced questions about his political views over his past position as president of the College Democrats of America and his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2000.However, Nicholson told Politico last year that he permanently changed parties after he served in Iraq in 2007. I knew what we were doing there,  he told Politico.  We were stabilizing that country. We made incredible amounts of progress.

5721, WATCH: Media Critic DESTROYS CNN For Hiring Trump’s Campaign Manager,"It s no secret that people are furious over the fact that CNN hired Donald Trump s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, just three days after he was fired from his position in Trump s presidential campaign. CNN felt the full force of the outrage during a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources.Before the panel discussion began, host Brian Stelter launched into the controversy surrounding Lewandowski s hiring. Stelter points out that Lewandowski has been consistently hostile to reporters during his job as Trump s campaign manager, he has been accused of battery by former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields   with video evidence to support the claim   and the fact that Lewandowski may very well have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump.During the discussion, Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik did not hold back his feelings about CNN s newest paid commentator. When asked how he feels about the hiring Zurawik said, I hate it. We are at this time in history where I think a lot of people feel that the media elites and political elites are in bed together and they re the losers. The people in America feel they are the losers. Zurawik says that he thinks that Lewandowski s hiring is particularly troubling to people because he fully embraced the tactics of McCarthyism during his time in the Trump campaign. The other thing I do want to say about getting information about the process from Lewandowski. Brian, if the folks at CNN, who I think have the best political reporters on television   if you guys need to pay him to tell you what s going on inside the Trump campaign, give your money back, you re not earning your paychecks.

22286,Washington Post Deceives Public & Profits From Fake News,"21st Century Wire says The Washington Post has been caught lying and deceiving the public twice in the last few weeks pushing the unfounded mainstream media meme that Russia invaded the U.S. electric grid and another claiming that Russia is behind the explosion of so-called  fake news. Considering that the power grid story was proven to be a fake news story that WashPost had to later retract  We have to consider the legitimacy of any further claims the outlet has against Russia as particularly dubious.The Intercept has some interesting analysis on how outlets such as WashPost not only deceive the public, push false state sponsored talking points but also how they profit financially from this collusion. Glenn Greenwald The InterceptIn the past six weeks, the Washington Post published two blockbuster stories about the Russian threat that went viral: one on how Russia is behind a massive explosion of  fake news,  the other on how it invaded the U.S. electric grid. Both articles were fundamentally false. Each now bears a humiliating editor s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: The first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom.The second story on the electric grid turned out to be far worse than I realized when I wrote about it on Saturday, when it became clear that there was no  penetration of the U.S. electricity grid  as the Post had claimed. In addition to the editor s note, the Russia-hacked-our-electric-grid story now has a full-scale retraction in the form of a separate article admitting that  the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility  and there may not even have been malware at all on this laptop.But while these debacles are embarrassing for the paper, they are also richly rewarding. That s because journalists   including those at the Post   aggressively hype and promote the original, sensationalistic false stories, ensuring that they go viral, generating massive traffic for the Post (the paper s executive editor, Marty Baron, recently boasted about how profitable the paper has become).After spreading the falsehoods far and wide, raising fear levels and manipulating U.S. political discourse in the process (both Russia stories were widely hyped on cable news), journalists who spread the false claims subsequently note the retraction or corrections only in the most muted way possible, and often not at all. As a result, only a tiny fraction of people who were exposed to the original false story end up learning of the retractions.Baron himself, editorial leader of the Post, is a perfect case study in this irresponsible tactic. It was Baron who went to Twitter on the evening of November 24 to announce the Post s expos  of the enormous reach of Russia s fake news operation, based on what he heralded as the findings of  independent researchers.  Baron s tweet went all over the place; to date, it has been re-tweeted more than 3,000 times, including by many journalists with their own large followings:Russian propaganda effort helped spread fake news during election, say independent researchers https://t.co/3ETVXWw16Q  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 25, 2016But after that story faced a barrage of intense criticism   from Adrian Chen in the New Yorker ( propaganda about Russia propaganda ), Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone ( shameful, disgusting ), my own article, and many others   including legal threats from the sites smeared as Russian propaganda outlets by the Post s  independent researchers    the Post finally added its lengthy editor s note distancing itself from the anonymous group that provided the key claims of its story ( The Post   does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot s findings  and  since publication of the Post s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list ).What did Baron tell his followers about this editor s note that gutted the key claims of the story he hyped? Nothing. Not a word. To date, he has been publicly silent about these revisions. Having spread the original claims to tens of thousands of people, if not more, he took no steps to ensure that any of them heard about the major walk back on the article s most significant, inflammatory claims. He did, however, ironically find the time to promote a different Post story about how terrible and damaging Fake News is: Pizzagate  shows how fake news hurts real people https://t.co/cOh7RZ4RqK  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 26, 2016WHETHER THE POST S false stories here can be distinguished from what is commonly called  Fake News  is, at this point, a semantic dispute, particularly since  Fake News  has no cogent definition. Defenders of Fake News as a distinct category typically emphasize intent in order to differentiate it from bad journalism. That s really just a way of defining Fake News so as to make it definitionally impossible for mainstream media outlets like the Post ever to be guilty of it (much the way terrorism is defined to ensure that the U.S. government and its allies cannot, by definition, ever commit it).But what was the Post s motive in publishing two false stories about Russia that, very predictably, generated massive attention, traffic, and political impact? Was it ideological and political   namely, devotion to the D.C. agenda of elevating Russia into a grave threat to U.S. security? Was it to please its audience   knowing that its readers, in the wake of Trump s victory, want to be fed stories about Russian treachery? Was it access and source servitude   proving it will serve as a loyal and uncritical repository for any propaganda intelligence officials want disseminated? Was it profit   to generate revenue through sensationalistic click-bait headlines with a reckless disregard to whether its stories are true? In an institution as large as the Post, with numerous reporters and editors participating in these stories, it s impossible to identify any one motive as definitive.Whatever the motives, the effects of these false stories are exactly the same as those of whatever one regards as Fake News. The false claims travel all over the internet, deceiving huge numbers into believing them. The propagators of the falsehoods receive ample profit from their false, viral  news.  And there is no accountability of the kind that would disincentivize a repeat of the behavior. (That the Post ultimately corrects its false story does not distinguish it from classic Fake News sites, which also sometimes do the same.)And while it s true that all media outlets make mistakes, and that even the most careful journalism sometimes errs, those facts do not remotely mitigate the Post s behavior here. In these cases, they did not make good faith mistakes after engaging in careful journalism. With both stories, they were reckless (at best) from the start, and the glaring deficiencies in the reporting were immediately self-evident (which is why both stories were widely attacked upon publication).As this excellent timeline by Kalev Leetaru documents, the Post did not even bother to contact the utility companies in question   the most elementary step of journalistic responsibility   until after the story was published. Intelligence officials insisting on anonymity   so as to ensure no accountability   whispered to them that this happened, and despite how significant the consequences would be, they rushed to print it with no verification at all. This is not a case of good journalism producing inaccurate reporting; it is the case of a media outlet publishing a story that it knew would produce massive benefits and consequences without the slightest due diligence or care.THE MOST IRONIC aspect of all this is that it is mainstream journalists   the very people who have become obsessed with the crusade against Fake News   who play the key role in enabling and fueling this dissemination of false stories. They do so not only by uncritically spreading them, but also by taking little or no steps to notify the public of their falsity.The Post s epic debacle this weekend regarding its electric grid fiction vividly illustrates this dynamic. As I noted on Saturday, many journalists reacted to this story the same way they do every story about Russia: They instantly click and re-tweet and share the story without the slightest critical scrutiny. That these claims are constantly based on the whispers of anonymous officials and accompanied by no evidence whatsoever gives those journalists no pause at all; any official claim that Russia and Putin are behind some global evil is instantly treated as Truth. That s a significant reason papers like the Post are incentivized to recklessly publish stories of this kind. They know they will be praised and rewarded no matter the accuracy or reliability because their Cause   the agenda   is the right one.On Friday night, immediately after the Post s story was published, one of the most dramatic pronouncements came from the New York Times s editorial writer Brent Staples, who said this:Now that this story has collapsed and been fully retracted, what has Staples done to note that this tweet was false?

19759,Did OPRAH Just Leave “Nasty” Hillary Wishing She Wouldn’t Have Endorsed Her? [VIDEO],"Four months ago, Oprah, the woman who made her fortune off preying on women s emotions and counting on their inability to think for themselves, gave Hillary s vagina an endorsement. She gave women absolutely no credible reason to support her, but reminded them, when you walk into the voting booth the choice is clear, one candidate has a vagina and the other one does not: Regardless of your politics, it s a seminal moment for women. What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom! It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world. What Oprah s essentially saying to women who hang on her every word is that it doesn t matter if you or your husband don t have a job. It doesn t matter if you live in a town supported by coal that Hillary promised to destroy. It doesn t matter that Hillary left our nation s top secret classified emails exposed for anyone in the world to see, simply because she believed she was above the law, or that every other person in the history of our government has been punished for less serious breaches of our national security.  Much like she tried to convince her viewers in 2008 that American needed a black President, she s now trying to convince her viewers they need to elect our first woman for President. Am I the only woman who finds Oprah s dumbing down of women to be an insult to my intelligence? Yesterday, Oprah weighed in on the election and gave an endorsement for Hillary that was an insult to the intelligence of every woman still clinging to her failed network. She essentially told them, you may not be smart enough to follow the news or to understand the seriousness of the content of the emails being leaked that prove Hillary was using her position as Secretary of State to funnel money into her Clinton Foundation. You may not even be smart enough to understand the seriousness of the recent videos released by James O Keefe of Project Veritas that show Democrats admitting to committing massive voter fraud for decades and inciting violence at Trump rallies. You may not even be smart enough to know these people featured in the undercover videos admit that Hillary and the DNC are fully aware of, and are funding their illegal activities. Yes, these same people are tied to Hillary who admit on tape they were responsible for the unprecedented violence a horrified America witnessed at Donald Trump s rally in her hometown of Chicago But let me tell you, that nasty woman you see on TV just ignore what you see, because, as Oprah states,  She s not coming over to your house! You don t have to like her,  she said.  You don t have to like her. Watch Oprah below. She apparently couldn t offer her female viewers one concrete reason to vote for Hillary, so instead she focused on reasons to overlook her negatives and vote for her anyhow. Is this really an endorsement that will help Hillary Clinton win with thinking women or will they just use her endorsement to point out to other women that Oprah couldn t even think of one good reason to vote for Hillary other than the obvious argument used for the low information voter she has a vagina.Here s a video of Hillary speaking down to a young reporter in Oprah s beloved Africa. Maybe Oprah s decided that it s okay for women in positions of power to talk to women like this, as long as you don t invite them over for dinner:",left-news,"Oct 22, 2016",woman fortune inability endorsement reason voting choice candidate vagina one politics moment ceiling ceiling boom anything leader world word matter husband job matter town coal matter nation top secret anyone world law person history government security president woman president woman insult intelligence yesterday election endorsement insult intelligence woman network news seriousness content prove position secretary state money foundation seriousness project voter fraud violence trump people people tape violence trump rally woman house watch offer reason vote anyhow endorsement win endorsement reason argument information voter vagina video reporter power dinner
3316, Newt Gingrich Admits Trump Is No Longer Draining The Swamp,"It s no secret that Trump s  drain the swamp  shtick was just that -B.S. Since being elected last month, Trump has ben naming the dirtiest, swampiest monsters to head his cabinet and Administration. Bankers, donors, politicians galore are lining up to turn the United States into a fascist regime for the rich and powerful.Yet, somehow, his voters don t believe it for a second. They re still convinced he s going to drain the swamp, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to tear him down.Only New Gingrich, and his all-knowing wisdom, inadvertently has exposed Trump for the fraud he really is. Talking to NPR s  Morning Edition,  the former Speaker (who left in disgrace), told reporters that Donald Trump will no longer be using the  cute  slogan of  drain the swamp  because it s not going to happen:I m told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn t want to use it anymore   [He had] written what I thought was a very cute tweet about  the alligators are complaining,  but somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.And just like that, another Trump promise   and one of his biggest   goes down in flames because the elite Republicans (which includes Gingrich) don t want to hear it anymore. So that makes Trump either a liar or a turtle-on-a-fencepost. Or both. Gingrich added that  he s in a different role now, and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. Not only is he being  more dignified  than th alligators, he s giving them government positions   like the Treasury Department, the SEC, and even the Transportation Department.And just like that, Trump drops another thing people trusted him with.

23253,SHOUT! POLL: Do the ‘White Helmets’ Qualify for a Nobel Peace Prize?," 21st Century Wire asks Currently throughout the western media exists a major public relations push to raise the profile of supposed  NGO  in Syria known as the  White Helmets  in advance of the upcoming Nobel Peace Prize award on Oct 7th in Oslo, Norway. Recently, streaming giant Netflix released a documentary film to much fanfare, about this alleged  first responder  group in Syria called the White Helmets. They produce many of the emotional images seen on western media about the Syrian conflict, and also claim to have saved 60,000 lives from  Assad s bombs  since 2013. What many people are not aware of, however, is that this group has been financed by NATO member states to the tune of at $60 million so far, and they are embedded exclusively in terrorist-held areas of Syria.

Entice Love, a 26-year-old mother of two from Sacramento, who works at the ranch told The Guardian:  I m for Hillary because she s cracking down on domestic violence.Many of them chose their profession, which is illegal in the other 49 U.S. states, to get health insurance for themselves and their families.Some suffer health problems that require expensive medication. Taylor Lee, a 26-year-old from Houston, told The Guardian her job at the Moonlite Ranch helped her keep up with payments for epilepsy pills   which cost $10 a piece.However she admitted she was pushed to vote for Hillary, but will be caucusing for rival Sanders.

13761,LOL! POLITICO Publishes Article Blaming TRUMP And His Supporters For Horrific Violence Committed Against Them,"This ridiculous article by Politico, who pretends to be a non-biased source for news is sadly, what passes as journalism today. We ve taken the liberty of highlighting the article in places where POLTICO has gone out of their way to blame Trump and/or his supporters for the violent protesters (many of whom are paid by leftist organizations). Our comments can be found in parenthesis following the highlighted copy.Outside Donald Trump s campaign rallies in recent days, protesters have gathered and, increasingly, clashed violently with Trump supporters and police. Inside, Trump is going to new rhetorical extremes in his attempts to delegitimize a Mexican-American judge. Together, (Together? Does anyone else find it to be slightly ridiculous that the person writing this piece would honestly think anyone believes Trump and the violent anti-Trump protesters were working together?) they re forming an increasingly combustible atmosphere as the campaign enters the summer and temperatures here climb into triple digits.Trump has in the past vowed to become more  presidential  after dispatching his primary foes, and many political observers hoped tensions would decrease as Trump pivoted to appeal to broader swath of voters in the general election.Instead, the end of the primary has seen a steady rise in tension, fueling fears that the convention in Cleveland next month will surpass the turbulence of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.Tense standoffs involving police, protesters and Trump supporters are common sights at campaign rallies, and violence has occasionally flared up, but there has been an uptick in the scale and frequency of violence over the past two weeks during the candidate s swing through the West. Most of the violence has been directed at police officers and Trump supporters outside rally venues, but on Friday, one local leader who condemned the violence also partly blamed Trump for it. (Of course, it s Trump s fault that the Left is paying people to riot and to attack innocent people along with the law enforcement officers who are hired to keep the peace.) While it s a sad statement about our political discourse that Mr. Trump has focused on stirring antagonism (Trump s fault) instead of offering real solutions to our nation s challenges, there is absolutely no place for violence against people who are simply exercising their rights to participate in the political process,  said San Jose Mayor Sam Riccardo, a Democrat, in a statement on Friday. In another statement, Riccardo said Trump s rhetoric is no excuse for violence and that city police would investigate and prosecute offenders. She said no protesters had applied for permits to demonstrate. In Albuquerque, where demonstrators shattered windows at the site of Trump s rally on Tuesday, police made three arrests and have an outstanding felony warrant for another demonstrator that includes eight counts of aggravated battery on a police officer, according to Albuquerque Police public information officer Tanner Tixier. He added that police were working four to five other cases that could lead to more arrests.Tidier also shot down as  conspiracy theories  rumors that anti-Trump demonstrators were illegal immigrants or paid agitators. (Because this public information officer knows each and every protester, and whether they ve been paid or are legal citizens of the United States.) They re just general local criminals. I don t even think they knew what they were protesting,  he said.The Mexican flag has been a common sight at recent protests in the West, which is home to many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. Trump, meanwhile, began insisting during the past week that the judge presiding over one of the lawsuits against Trump University, Gonzalo Curiel, could not be fair because of his Mexican heritage. The statement   condemned by House Speaker Paul Ryan, editorial boards and legal watchdogs   can only inflame tensions out here. Muriel, the son of Mexican immigrants, was born in Indiana. (Because if Paul Ryan condemned Trump, the whole Republican party must be against him right?)Despite the warning signs, there is little indication from the Trump campaign or anti-Trump demonstrators that they plan to change course, making continued unrest likely in the months ahead. (In other words, there is no indication Trump plans to change his policies in order to appease illegal aliens and leftist thugs.)Entire article can be found at Politico",politics,"Jun 4, 2016",article politico non source news journalism today liberty article way trump parenthesis copy trump campaign days police trump judge anyone person piece anyone trump anti trump campaign summer trump vowed primary trump swath election end primary rise tension convention month turbulence convention tense police trump campaign violence scale frequency violence candidate violence police trump rally leader violence trump course fault left people people law enforcement peace statement discourse trump antagonism trump fault nation place violence people process mayor sam democrat statement statement rhetoric excuse violence city police site trump police felony warrant demonstrator battery police officer police information officer tanner police conspiracy trump information officer protester flag sight west home week judge trump university heritage statement house speaker editorial son party warning indication trump campaign trump course indication trump order article politico
6148, This Touching Moment POTUS Shared With A Hiroshima Survivor Is Why He’ll Be So Sorely Missed (VIDEO),"President Obama s trip to Hiroshima would come and go without an official apology to the Japanese people for dropping hellfire on them to end World War II. The official position of the U.S. government is that the bombings were a necessary evil to end a war with no end in sight, ultimately saving lives and bringing the world back to peace. Just because the President wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be.While the president s speech was eloquent, reminding us that the people of Hiroshima were just like you and I, it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world. In this video by ABC News, you can see President Obama intently listening to the man s story through a translator. At one point the man begins to break down and our President, obviously working off of pure decency and instinct, put his arm around the man and gave him a hug.The Japanese are a proud people who prefer the bow and the handshake, but the elderly gentleman who had been to hell and back seemed grateful that the President of the United States would show him such compassion:Conservatives, who have been demonizing the president s plans to visit the site for weeks now are out in force, condemning the action as an apology rather than a human being connecting with another human being in a display of true compassion, something their shallow, selfish minds can t quite reconcile with. Anne Coulter, for example, tweeted this bit of assholery before the President hit the podium in Hiroshima:For someone ""born in Hawaii,"" you'd think Obama would prefer visiting Pearl Harbor. pic.twitter.com/F3z1UwHVy9  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 27, 2016Leave it to someone as crass as Coulter to take something as simple as a trip to a friendly state and turn it into the ugliest thing possible.

23006,BREAKING: Trump’s Travel Ban Halt Upheld by 9th Circuit Court,"21st Century Wire says Today the 9th Circuit Court of appeals has ruled to uphold the halt on allowing enforcement of President Trump s Executive Order banning travel from seven countries in the Middle East. Even as the mainstream media is touting it as a  win  for left wing activists and the democrats who have their heels dug in against  all things Trump,  many readers will find that it is not much of a surprise to hear that the case will be headed to a further round of appeals. It may be difficult for the courts to continue holding up this stay against the Executive Order as their primary argument is that the order is a  Muslim ban.  Anyone who s read the actual Executive Order Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US will find it fairly clear that there is no such language in the EO. RT explores this breaking news further in the report below with some embedded commentary from Lionel Media. RT We hold that the government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,  the appeals court s decision said.Government lawyers were put to the test by the three-judge panel, arguing in favor of enforcing the travel ban while litigation over it is ongoing.The 9th Circuit Court was not ruling on whether the order was constitutional or not. The issue at hand was whether it would be enforced while legal challenges made their way through the judicial system.Large parts of the executive order had been suspended by US District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle, who incurred President Trump s fury on Twitter. Trump called him a  so-called judge  who  opens up our country to potential terrorists  and puts the country in  peril. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Trump s gripes with the judicial branch of government were echoed by DOJ lawyer August E. Flentje. When asked on Tuesday by Judge Michelle T. Friedland whether he was arguing  that the president s decision in that regard is unreviewable,  Flentje responded in the affirmative.Washington Solicitor General Noah Purcell, who also represented Minnesota, seemed to express similar feelings when he argued to keep the travel ban in place by telling the appeals court that if they did not  abdicate  their check on the executive branch, they would  throw the country back into chaos. The three judges also argued amongst themselves over whether or not the travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries constituted a Muslim ban. Judge Richard Clifton argued that the countries affected by the executive order  encompass only a relatively small percentage of Muslims. I have trouble understanding we re supposed to infer religious animus,  he said.Washington State argued against the DOJ and claimed that the ban was based on religion after former Trump advisor, Rudy Giuliani, claimed on Fox News that Trump had asked him how to pass a legal Muslim ban.Wash.: Well, the Pres called for complete bans on Muslims entering the country. That's what adviser said on TV. #WAvTrump  Brian Goldman (@briangoldman) February 7, 2017 Wash.: We can infer animus from public statements of Pres and top advisers   intent to ban Muslims. #WAvTrump  Brian Goldman (@briangoldman) February 7, 2017Washington also cited the many lawful permanent residents who were impacted by the executive order, some of whom were detained in airports after trying to reenter the country legally. While the executive order has since been rewritten to exclude lawful permanent residents, Washington argued that it was a sign of  bad faith.

11008,BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN Reveals The Shocking Truth About His Rock Anthem “Born In The USA”,"The truth about Springsteen is so disappointing (see below) but this one takes the cake!Bruce Springsteen has been a sellout all these years. He s not the person he portrayed himself to be to the American people.He just revealed he nearly gave up  one of his most iconic anthems Born In The USA, admitting he believed it was too insincere and  glib . He said he doesn t  feel comfortable  singing the song. It s almost like he s apologizing for appearing to be patriotic. Are you thinking what we re thinking? He sang that song so many times but never felt ok singing it? That s the difference between Springsteen and someone like Lee Greenwood. Lee Greenwood has always been a passionate and fearless supporter of America and the American way. Springsteen is just a phony Speaking at a Q&A session with Tom Hanks at the Tribeca Film Festival, the 67-year-old rocker opened up to the Oscar-winning actor, insisting that it was E Street Band guitarist Stevie Van Zandt who convinced him to keep the 1984 hit.Springsteen s memorable tune was written in part tribute to friends who had served in the American Army during the Vietnam War and the ironic treatment of the veterans upon their return home. He divulged:  Stevie [Van Zandt, longtime guitarist in the E Street Band] convinced me to keep that song. I remember at the time thinking it s too glib. It s too glib. I think I still think that. But Stevie said,  No, no, no   it s about the band, the brotherhood of the band, the fans. The New Jersey native   who has been married to Patti Scialfa since 1991   added that he gave his musical peer the  benefit of the doubt  but still doesn t feel quite comfortable with the song.Adding:  I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We ve played it an awful lot ever since. But I was always a little frightened of it. And the whole record I always have mixed feelings about.  Despite his feelings, the epochal song has received much praise throughout the years and was ranked 275th on Rolling Stone s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time as well as placed on RIAA s Songs of the Century.The fan favorite and title track of his 1984 album of the same name inspired famed photographer Annie Leibovitz s iconic photo of Springsteen s backside against the backdrop of an American flag for the record cover. Commenting on the concept in 1984, the Medal of Freedom recipient told Rolling Stone:  We had the flag on the cover because the first song was called  Born in the U.S.A. , and the theme of the record kind of follows from the themes I ve been writing about for at least the last six or seven years.Read more: Daily MailSPRINGSTEEN JUST RELEASED A SONG THAT BASHES PRESIDENT TRUMP Bruce Springsteen aka  The Boss  is showing all of his fans just how out of touch he is with his latest song. He s been a fervent anti-Trump guy and has been very outspoken against President Donald Trump. His new protest song refers to Trump as a  con man . What a way to disrespect the leader of our nation! has Bruce Springsteen employed thousands of Americans? It s interesting that Trump just delivered one of the best ever speeches to the builders union. Please watch the video provided below of what a real working man does for his crew. It s an awesome speech that totally discounts everything Springsteen is trying to say to bash Trump. Shame on him!The 67-year-old rocker released his and Joe Grushecky s anti-Trump song, called  That s What Makes Us Great,  and it is a direct comment on the president and his administration, according to Pitchfork.Springsteen s part of the song goes as follows: Don t tell me a lieAnd sell it as a factI ve been down that road beforeAnd I ain t going back.And don t you brag to meThat you never read a bookI never put my faithIn a con man and his crooks.  During an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gushecky talked about writing the song in January after Trump was sworn-in as president I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,  Grushecky said.  I sent it to him and he liked it. I said,  What do you think about singing on it?  He gave it the Bruce treatment. In February, Springsteen said he was an  embarrassed  American during a concert in Australia. On the same tour he attacked Trump s first travel ban as  un-American. Tonight we want to add our voice to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,  Springsteen told the crowd.  America is a nation of immigrants. This is fundamentally un-American. What a bunch of bull! Springsteen has lost his roots and his sense of the working man. If he cared to know anything about President Trump then he would know Trump s bringing back American jobs. He s working hard to get the steel industry up and running again. He just held a  Buy American, Hire American  event promoting keeping jobs in America. What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America! The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see..

13217,FEDERAL JUDGE Goes On Rant About Cops Killing Blacks….Declares: “Black Lives Matter!”…Blames Deaths Of Cops On Cops,"This is a great story for anyone who doesn t understand the power one liberal judge can wield from the bench. U.S. District Judge Robart, who is presiding over a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to adopt reforms to address federal allegations of police bias, rebuked the Seattle police union for holding up reforms as it bargains over a new contract, The Seattle Times reported. The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,  the judge said, according to the paper. To hide behind a collective-bargaining agreement is not going to work,  he said.Kevin Stuckey, who recently became president of the Seattle Police Officers  Guild, said the union is prepared to sit down with the city and reach a deal.Judge Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, said proposed police reform legislation should include putting a civilian in charge of police oversight, shutting down a police-led disciplinary board and creating a civilian position of inspector general.Judge Robart threatened to call a hearing and override the city s bargaining process with the union if he concluded the union was interfering with reform, The Times reported. The judge ended Monday s hearing by citing a statistic that claimed 41 percent of the shootings nationwide by police were of blacks.  Black lives matter,  he said, drawing an audible reaction in a courtroom, The Times reported.Judge Robart added that the recent targeted shootings of police officers across the country signaled the importance of strengthening police and community relations.Commissioner Enrique Gonzalez said he s  very encouraged that a federal judge has actually said that black lives matter, because now we know that not only is this movement happening in the streets   even a federal judge has acknowledged that people of color have been on the receiving end of police brutality and this needs to change,  The Stranger reported.

2139," House Intelligence Committee: Trump Lied About Obama, Absolutely Zero Evidence Of Wiretapping (VIDEO)","Less than 24 hours after Trump s press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was  extremely confident  that his accusations against Obama for wiretapping Trump Tower would be proven correct, the House Intelligence Committee scheduled a press conference to say they found zero evidence that this happened. Absolutely zero.House Intel Chair Devin Nunes has been a strong Trump supporter and has repeatedly flirted with launching a full-fledged investigation into Trump s claims that Obama spied on him. Instead, after a week of complete nonsense, Nunes said he and his committee are confident there was not  an actual tap of Trump Tower.  This directly contradicts Trump s unfounded accusation:How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Despite repeated calls to provide evidence, Trump has not done so. Nunes said in light of the lack of evidence, he isn t buying it.GOP House Intel Chair on Trump's claim:  We don t have any evidence that took place   I don t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower  pic.twitter.com/Ojco3ZFJ1f  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 15, 2017Trump has failed to provide any details about the allegations he made against Obama. According to a timeline of events and also staffers within the White House, Trump got his information   which would implicate Obama in a major felony   from a story run on white nationalist website Breitbart, which, in turn, had lifted the conspiracy theory almost verbatim from a conservative radio host named Mark Levin. Neither Breitbart nor Levin bothered to offer any proof for these allegations. (In fairness, neither probably expected that their Obama hit job pieces would find their way into the president s early morning tweetstorms and their regular readers, eager to hate Obama, don t typically require evidence for their outrageous claims.)So it s painfully obvious that Trump is a unrepentant liar, but being a Republican hack meant Nunes couldn t let it go at that. He had to try to paint Obama as sinister in other ways. Rather than admit his president is a liar who made these allegations without a shred of proof, Nunes expanded his definition of  spying  to include the  incidental collection of Americans that were possibly tied to Trump s campaign.  He hoped this would mean Americans would see that as an intrusion of Trump s privacy.Which is extremely weird because that only goes to show the uncomfortable relationships between Trump and the Russians during the campaign. The very fact that their were  incidental collections  of information on Trump s staffers was because those staffers (think Michael Flynn) were communicating with Russian operatives who were under surveillance. This would be like having a chat with an ISIS leader then being mad that the CIA listened in.Ironically, that makes Trump and his goons look much worse than either Obama or the CIA.So how does Nunes sleep at night knowing he s supporting a president who is   at best   a pathological liar? He said he s not sure Trump was being  literal  when he accused Obama of the worst political crime since Watergate:House Intel Chair Devin Nunes:  Are you going to take the tweets literally?

8284, Watch The EXACT Moment Marco Rubio Saw His Presidential Hopes Die On Super Bowl Sunday (VIDEO),"Marco Rubio might have been flying high after the results from Iowa, but he well and truly crashed hard at Saturday night s ABC GOP debate in New Hampshire. Like Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson before him, Rubio watched his Presidential hopes die.There s no way to sugar coat this one   Rubio choked. He likely over-rehearsed, came prepared with his lines all ready, but was then totally unable to respond to spontaneous questions during the debate. The result? He churned out the exact same line four times in a row, word-for-word, within minutes, unable to expand on his soundbite.Someone had clearly told Rubio to hit Obama hard, and so he had to keep saying that  Republicans need to dispense with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing.  It landed the first time he said it, but then he just couldn t stop saying it. It was truly awkward to watch, and you could see the panic in his eyes. Think about a child in the school play who forgets their next line, so just keeps repeating the last one over and over to a silent audience. That.Further down the panel, Chris Christie smelled blood and went in for the kill. He has maintained an attack on Rubio for being too polished and inauthentic, and this played right into that. But instead of Rubio taking the opportunity to come back at Christie with a counter-attack, he literally went back and repeated his Obama line again. We re not kidding. Watch.As AL.com s post-debate roundup puts it:Instead of responding, Rubio repeated the same statements and made Christie looked like his criticism was spot on. It was a strange exchange and one that seemed to taint the rest of Rubio s debate   he ended up repeating himself over and over and looked lost. He did better later in the debate but it could very well be Rubio s Howard Dean moment.The morning after the debate, with all eyes on Rubio to rally back, the candidate may well have killed his campaign. Appearing on ABC with George Stephanopoulous, Rubio was asked to respond to critics of his  robotic  performance. His answer looked great first time: I would pay them to keep running that clip. Because that s what I believe passionately. It s one of the reasons that I m not running for re-election in the Senate. I m running for president. But then Stephanopoulos followed up with a rebuttal: But you re getting pounded for repeating that speech. And then it all fell apart. Because Rubio had scripted one line, and one line only, to respond to critics that he scripts his lines. So, he went on repeat again. I hope they keep running it,  he replied.  And I m going to keep saying it because it s true. And then he said it again. It s what I believe and it s what I m going to continue to say, Because it s one of the main reasons why I am running. If you watch the video closely, you might just be able to spot the exact moment where Rubio realizes his Presidential hopes just died.

6661, Rape Deemed Legal In Oklahoma Because You Can’t Substitute Force With Intoxication Under The Law,"The definition of rape came under fire in Oklahoma Wednesday when a the state s high court ruled that a girl who had accused a boy of sexually assaulting her was too drunk to be a reliable witness and dismissed the charges against the boy she says raped her while she was either too intoxicated or unconscious. She was 14 at the time of the assault and he was 17.The boy claims that the girl, who was four times past the legal limit to drive, engaged in a consensual oral act with him. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with him, stating that  force can t be substituted with intoxication under the [forced sodomy] law.  Prosecutors are furious, because the boy gets a walk, and while the court also said,  We will not, in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense, enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language,  it stated it in an  unpublished opinion,  meaning the case can t be cited as precedent.That means that nothing has changed. The court has given its opinion on what some poor drunk teenage girl forever changed because a poor decision led to a boy who is legally an adult in many states raped her and got away with it. By saying it isn t precedent means they certainly don t want to close the door on the fact that people are raped, just not for this girl, who they obviously believe could have possibly been responsible for such a thing at 14-years-old. They don t make good decisions when they re stone cold sober, nevermind when you ply them with booze.From what s available, the boy, who had a friend with him, gave the girl a ride home because she was so drunk. He dropped his friend off first, who would testify that the girl was drifting in and out of consciousness, and somewhere between there and the girl s house his DNA ended up all over her and she has no memory of the encounter. The court said they wouldn t create a crime to prosecute one offender because the forcible sodomy law says you have to use force, not alcohol or by that logic, date rape drugs, to incapacitate and force yourself on your victim.Interpreting law is what a high court does. Does somebody really have to tell these idiots that rape is about control, not sex? Maybe they saw this one kid as some believable victim of a circumstance beyond his control, but what they ve done is fostered a rapist and given plenty of other young abusers -in-training a new something to think about. Until Oklahoma either changes the law or replaces the imbeciles on its high court who interpret it, it s a breeding ground for predatory behavior.Featured image from okhouse.gov",News,"April 28, 2016",definition rape fire state court girl boy witness boy time assault boy girl times limit act court force intoxication sodomy law boy walk court order prosecution person enlarge statute meaning language opinion case precedent nothing court opinion teenage girl decision boy adult precedent door fact people girl thing sober booze boy friend girl ride home friend girl consciousness girl house memory encounter court crime offender sodomy law force date rape victim law court rape control victim circumstance control rapist plenty something law court breeding ground behavior image
5055, WATCH: Brian Stelter Slams Sean Hannity For His Disturbing Lies About Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"Brian Stelter just called out Sean Hannity during a segment of CNN s Reliable Sources on Sunday morning for some of the ridiculous claims he has made this past week about Hillary Clinton s health.In case you didn t know, there has been a strange right-wing conspiracy going around that Hillary Clinton has some severe health problems. Hannity has been the leading propagator of the claim. Hannity had the cojones to claim that evidence for his allegations was provided by an Associated Press reporter named Lisa Lerer.Lerer called Hannity out on his fictitious claims, definitively proving that Clinton is not, in fact, suffering from seizures and that Hannity had made the whole story up. Here is a snippet from Lerer s must read conspiracy debunking article: The conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity opened a 6-minute Thursday night segment titled  Hillary s Health  by saying,  as speculation swirls about Hillary Clinton s health,  citing a headline from the right-wing news site Drudge Report.Hannity repeatedly played the muffin shop footage, describing what Clinton was doing as  this sort of twitching thing that she does in front of reporters that was really bad  and then as  a violent, violent, repetitive jerking of the head. Seemingly as  proof  that something was amiss with Clinton, Hannity exclaimed:  Watch the reporter, like, pull back as she   the reporter got scared. And she keeps doing it. What is that? Fox News never contacted me to ask that question. For the record, I wasn t scared for a moment. During the segment on Reliable Sources, Stelter calls Hannity s reporting  reckless,  and says that  Last time I checked. Fox still has the word  news  in its name. Even for Fox News, Hannity s  reporting  is pathetic. This is the type of conspiracy you might expect to read on a right-wing  news  site like World Net Daily. I suppose this just means that the right-wing media is more desperate than ever to try and smear Clinton.You can watch the segment below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hImyTr0-4MFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"August 14, 2016",segment morning week health case right conspiracy health propagator claim evidence press reporter fact story snippet conspiracy article fox news host minute night segment health speculation health headline wing news site drudge report muffin shop footage sort thing front violent head proof something reporter pull reporter news question record moment segment reckless time fox word news name news type conspiracy wing news site world wing media segment watch image video

12915,OBAMA Made CHRISTIAN Pastor Pay For His Own Ticket Home After Iran Got Secret $1.7 Billion Ransom For His Release,"Just when you thought there was nothing Barack Hussein Obama could do to shock you this Christian pastor s story is revealed. How much money does an American who spends 3 1/2 years in an Iranian prison leave with? Enough for a one-way ticket home to the U.S?Iranian president Hassan Rouhani spoke before the United Nations General Assembly Thursday despite protests from Iranian-Americans who feel Iran s human rights situation has worsened after sanctions were modified earlier this year.Pastor Saeed Abedini, one of four American hostages released from Iran in January, shared his disbelief of Rouhani s annual speech during an interview with FOX Business Network s Trish Regan. I was just telling people that imagine leader of ISIS come to the United States after 30 years of all the executions that they did and leaders of the world shaking his hand. It s unbelievable,  Abedini said.Iranian-American Pastor Saeed Abedini, who spent three-and-a-half years in Iranian prisons before being released in January, claims that the United States government wouldn t pay for a return flight home even though his family faced serious financial issues.Abedini said he and other hostages were left to fend for themselves after flying from Iran to Germany when they were released after the Obama Administration s $400 million payment to Iran.The United States  sent Iran $400 million in debt plus $1.3 billion in interest, and the money was disbursed as a ransom payment for four American hostages of the Islamic regime, a top Iranian commander said Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, the U.S. paid the Iranian regime $425 million dollars per American hostage, according to the commander.After spending a few days in a hospital in Germany, Adedini was surprised to hear that he needed to buy his own plane ticket home. We were actually all shocked because I came out; I just had prison clothes and [they] just told us you need to buy your own ticket. Abedini said he was physically and psychologically tortured in the Iranian prison to the point where his stomach was bleeding for months from all the beatings.

9799,LOL! SNARKY WHITE YAHOO Sports Writer TRASHES Black NHL Player P.K.Subban For Saying He’ll “Never Kneel During National Anthem” Because He Has “Too Much Respect For American Flag”,"How very bold of the white Yahoo sports writer Greg Wyshynski, who affectionately refers to himself as  Puck Daddy  to call out one of only a handful of black men in the NHL for not standing up for the Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, that disrespects our flag, and our veterans in one fell swoop Wyshynski writes: P.K. Subban said on Tuesday that he will  never  kneel during the national anthem to protest something politically.Subban performed at a fundraiser on Tuesday night at Zanies Comedy Club in Nashville, to benefit Comedy Cares. He told the audience that he would  never  take a knee during the national anthem because he has too much respect for the American flag. His comments were sent to us by two eyewitnesses and confirmed by the Predators. Subban, who is Canadian, is considered the most prominent black player in pro hockey.Earlier in the day, the Nashville Predators announced that, as a team, they would not engage in any protests during the national anthem. This came less than two days after hundreds of NFL players, coaches and executives showed solidarity in rebuking President Donald Trump s comments that players who protested police brutality against African-Americans during the national anthem were  sons of bitches  who deserved to lose their jobs.Said CEO Sean Henry, to the Tennessean: When this all came about, we wanted to get together with our team because everything we do is collaborative. When we say what we re going to be doing, it really is a  we.  Everyone had input on it. We are honoring the anthem and the flag and the country by standing during the anthem. We invite our fans to do so with us.  It is also our way of honoring what else it stands for, and it does provide for the freedom for others to express their views and protests in a manner in which they feel comfortable doing. We just think there s proper forums for all. Our games have become this unifying celebration, so we have decided that we re all going to stand together to honor the country and all that comes with it. According to Seth Dean, a Predators fans who attended the comedy fundraiser event, Subban took the stage and said  he will continue to stand, respect, and sing along with U.S. anthem.  At one point, he pointed out a friend of his in the crowd who was a law enforcement officer from Boston.From Dean: He also addressed why he always shuffles his feet during anthem. He first said it could be ADD but he was never tested. Then he mentioned just being pumped up by crowd and excited to support USA even as a Canadian. He even jokingly suggested we should all stand and sing anthem there at Zanies (which didn t happen). He obviously wasn t going to go against Lavy s proclamation that players were going to stay standing, especially with his coach in the room, but he made his support for anthem as unequivocal as he possibly could. In an email to Yahoo Sports, Hailey, another attendee, described the scene in more detail:Tonight was a comedy fundraiser at Zanies in Nashville, for which Ryan Hamilton was the headliner. As my attendance was spontaneous, I was pretty excited when PK Subban was the first  comedian . Much to my surprise, his allegedly  impromptu  set ended with a tense promise from PK that despite his previous dancing antics during the national anthem, he would NEVER kneel during the national anthem, followed by a long rant about his  respect  for the American flag.

178, BREAKING: The First Charges Have Been Filed In Mueller’s Russia Investigation,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller appears to have turned something up in his investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal. The first official charges have been filed according to CNN, and someone may well be taken into custody in just a few days. While the House and Senate seem to be throwing in the towel on their investigations, and Republicans including Trump himself are ramping up their calls for investigations into Hillary and Uranium One, Mueller is still doing his job.CNN has an exclusive story on this. The charges are currently sealed by order of a federal judge, and Mueller s office would not comment. However, they say: Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are. Mueller was appointed special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The original investigation was into whether Trump obstructed justice in firing Comey, but lately, he and his team have been interviewing everyone from Paul Manafort to Michael Flynn   both of whom have known ties to Russia and pro-Russia groups.Mueller s office has also been looking into a meeting between Don Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian attorney who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr. even said he  loved it  when he said he d take the meeting. He promptly lied about it, saying it was about adoptions, and then released emails proving he lied.Since it s not clear what the charges are or who they re against, there are all sorts of possibilities. The dominoes clearly are starting to fall, and Trump s increasingly loud focus on Hillary and Democrats shows that he s running ever more frightened.Featured image via media library",News,"October 27, 2017",counsel something investigation trump russia scandal official someone custody days house senate towel trump job story order judge office anyone custody counsel trump director investigation trump justice team everyone russia office meeting trump attorney information meeting focus image media
15080,FBI SAYS DEM PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER HILLARY Could Face 10 Years In Prison…FBI Furious As Obama Interferes With Investigation,"The corrupt covering for the corrupt. Chicago politics at its best Hillary Clinton could be prosecuted in federal court for failing to tell President Barack Obama about her private email server at the time she was running it, according to a veteran FBI agent. Obama said flatly during a  60 Minutes  interview on Sunday that  No,  he did not know Clinton sidestepped security protocols with her a home-brew email setup while she was his secretary of state.The FBI agent who spoke with DailyMail.com has had a 20-year career in federal law enforcement and serves in a supervisory capacity in a domestic FBI field office.He said on Friday that failing to put Obama in the loop could be enough to send her to prison for ten years. Via:Daily MailEver since he opined that the police had  acted stupidly  prior to the infamous and embarrassing  beer summit , Obama has shown himself eager to interfere with ongoing investigations for political reasons. When thuglet Trayvon Martin provided an good example of why jumping and beating down a stranger is a bad evolutionary strategy, Obama jumped on the race-baiting bandwagon saying if he had a son, that son would look like Martin. When the Justice Department was looking into the illegal use of the IRS to harass opponents of the administration, Obama said  there is not even a smidgen of corruption.  When deserter and failed turncoat Bowe Bergdahl was released by the Taliban, Obama had his hippie parents over for a Rose Garden ceremony even though he was known at the time to be a deserter. Now Obama has interjected himself into the investigation into the fate of top secret documents illegally stored on Hillary Clinton s private server. From his 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft on October 11:Steve Kroft: Do you think it posed a national security problem?President Barack Obama: I don t think it posed a national security problem. I think that it was a mistake that she has acknowledged and  you know, as a general proposition, when we re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data. And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it. I do think that the way it s been ginned-up is in part because of  in part  because of politics. And I think she d be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly. But Steve Kroft: What was your reaction when you found out about it?President Barack Obama: This is one of those issues that I think is legitimate, but the fact that for the last three months this is all that s been spoken about is an indication that we re in presidential political season.Steve Kroft: Do you agree with what President Clinton has said and Secretary Clinton has said, that this is not  not that big a deal. Do you agree with that?President Barack Obama: Well, I m not going to comment on Steve Kroft: You think it s not that big a deal President Barack Obama: What I think is that it is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public. And they can make their own judgment. I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America s national security was endangered.Steve Kroft: This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers.President Barack Obama: Well, I  there s no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We don t get an impression that here there was purposely efforts  on  in  to hide something or to squirrel away information. But again, I m gonna leave it to This can only be seen as an attempt by Obama to tell the federal prosecutors who will ultimately decide what, if any, charges should be made in this case that there is nothing to see here:Those statements angered F.B.I. agents who have been working for months to determine whether Ms. Clinton s email setup had in fact put any of the nation s secrets at risk, according to current and former law enforcement officials.Investigators have not reached any conclusions about whether the information on the server had been compromised or whether to recommend charges, according to the law enforcement officials. But to investigators, it sounded as if Mr. Obama had already decided the answers to their questions and cleared anyone involved of wrongdoing.The White House quickly backed off the president s remarks and said Mr. Obama was not trying to influence the investigation. But his comments spread quickly, raising the ire of officials who saw an instance of the president trying to influence the outcome of a continuing investigation   and not for the first time.A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Ron Hosko, a former senior F.B.I. official who retired in 2014 and is now the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said it was inappropriate for the president to  suggest what side of the investigation he is on  when the F.B.I. is still investigating. Injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact-finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the F.B.I. s mouth and makes them fear that no matter what they find, the Justice Department will take the president s signal and not bring a case,  said Mr. Hosko, who maintains close contact with current agents.Several current and former law enforcement officials, including those close to the investigation, expressed similar sentiments in separate interviews over several days. Most, however, did so only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.Contrary to what Hillary s campaign is saying, we now have it on pretty good authority that the FBI is conducting an investigation under the part of the Espionage Act that pertains to gross negligence in the handling of Defense information. That information, at a minimum, is the two Top Secret Keyhole satellite derived documents discovered by the Intelligence Community IG though it could be any of the over 400 emails containing classified information that have been uncovered so far.(f) Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer  Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

5342, The Ridiculous Reasons Obama’s Half-Brother Is Voting For Trump (VIDEO),"The right is giddy over the fact that President Obama s Kenyan half-brother Malik says he plans to vote for Donald Trump. They shouldn t be. His reasons for voting for the braggadocios billionaire are even worse than the reasons for most Americans.Malik Obama lives in Kenya, but he is eligible to vote in the United States because he sometimes lives in Maryland and he worked there. Rupert Murdoch s New York Post claims that Malik is registered to vote in the United States.Malik is the oldest of the Obama brothers; he s related through their father, but the two men have different mothers. The older Obama, 58, has spent most of his life as a Democrat, but likes Trump s slogan of  Mak(ing) America Great Again.  He doesn t like Hillary Clinton s email scandal, and he has more than one personal bone to pick with his younger brother.About Trump: I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,  Malik Obama told The Post from his home in the rural village of Kogelo.  Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him. About Hillary Clinton and the email situation: She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,  said Obama.The third reason makes one question whether Malik had been a Democrat at all. The man who reportedly has as many as 12 wives hates the idea of marriage equality. I feel like a Republican now because they don t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,  he said.Then, it gets a bit more personal. The elder Obama says that he was close, personal friends with ousted and assassinated dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn t make things any better in Libya,  he said.  My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard. Malik has an even more personal beef with his brother. It s about money. Malik is in charge of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, which named after the Obamas  father. The foundation was set up to help people in their native village in Kenya, but it hadn t registered with the state of Virginia, from which it was run. Shortly after the story became public, the IRS approved the foundation s tax exempt status. Fingers pointed at President Obama, but Malik insists his brother didn t help at all, and for that, he seems to resent him. My brother didn t help me at all,  said Obama.  He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn t supported me at all. Oh, and the President also refused to intervene in his older brother s foray into politics, when he ran for governor of his Kenyan county. Malik partly blames his brother for his loss.Here s the video:Trump, in the meantime, is loving it. Wow, President Obama s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016None of this should be terribly surprising. Despite the fact that the two men were best men at each others  weddings, Malik got on the birther train. He even questioned whether the President actually shared a father with him. Of course, we can also go birther, asking if Malik is actually registered to vote.Featured image via New York Post screenshot.",News,"July 24, 2016",right fact president half brother malik trump billionaire york post malik malik father men life democrat slogan ing scandal bone brother trump trump heart malik post home village slogan situation custodian information reason question malik democrat man idea marriage equality stand sex marriage bit elder dictator brother secretary state regard malik beef brother money malik charge foundation foundation people village state story foundation tax status president malik brother help brother oh president older brother foray politics governor county malik brother loss video trump president brother malik president everybody trump fact men men malik train president father course malik image york post
14934,TED CRUZ Demands We Put Immediate Halt On Plans To Bring Refugees With Terror Ties To America,"Thank God America has people like Ted Cruz in our Senate, who are unafraid speak out against the enemy, and fight for the safety and security of our nation. Now, if we could only get our  Commander in Chief  to accurately identify and confront the enemy America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. This is an evil that does not discriminate between French, German or American, Christian, Muslim or Jew, soldier, football player, or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious, totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies, and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary. We must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS  ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris, we need to take immediate, commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means. Such steps, however, are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not  violent extremism.  It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America that it is, in effect, signing your own death warrant.

7750, WATCH Trevor Noah’s Takedown Of Iowa GOP’s Chilling Proposal To Let Kids Have Guns,"The Daily Show, be it under the hosting of Jon Stewart or Trevor Noah, has never been subtle about its disdain for the GOP s idiocy. However, Tuesday night s episode was more chilling than almost any we ve ever seen, since it addressed a terrifying bill that is being proposed by House Republicans in Iowa   a bill that would let children have guns. Host Trevor Noah was understandably incredulous at the fact that this is even a thing. First, Noah addressed the fact that kids can already use hunting rifles, but not handguns, with adult supervision. He began by comparing this lunacy to the notorious hatred between Justin Beiber fans ( Beliebers ) and New Direction fans ( Directioners ): Beliebers vs. Directoners just got a whole lot more interesting. Noah then turned his attentions to kids who like to hunt: Some kids do like hunting. It s those kids who only like the first five minutes of Bambi. But then, things got downright scary, when Noah played a clip from a news station that detailed the intentions of Nathan Gibson, a gun nut who has been letting his kids use handguns since they were 5, even though it is illegal. He s now trying to make his illegal and dangerous actions with his own children the law of the land in the state of Iowa. Just to get this straight: Some guy picked up the phone and called a lawmaker and said  Hey, uh, my kids need guns.  And they were like,  Done!  And every day in America there s parents calling lawmakers saying,  Hey, my kids died because of guns.  And they re like,  Uhh, can you hold? Noah went on to described the absurdity of all of this in terms even a fool could understand (though I doubt the fools falling in line behind this dangerous nonsense will care). He began by asking,  Do you know what children are?  and showed clips of crying, tantrum-throwing kids. Who watches that and says,  Uh, I like that, but it s missing something.  After that, the clip was repeated, this time with gunfire. He ended on a chilling note: Oh, and by the way, that was under adult supervision. You do realize that. That kid was doing that under adult supervision. I love that the adult was like,  I m just gonna video this. Watch the video below:And this is why we should not allow gun nuts to make laws. They truly are insane. Thank you, Trevor Noah, for telling it like it is.

6243, This Attack Ad Accidentally Reveals What’s Really Behind The Bathroom Laws,"If you ve ever wondered why suddenly, now, Christian conservatives are making a huge stink over where people go to the bathroom, grab a match and take a look at this attack ad in Texas.Mail piece says @BriscoeCain is  well known  to those who frequent gay bars in Montrose section of Houston #TxLege pic.twitter.com/fqMH682gWz  Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016On its face, it looks like a pretty standard below the belt political attack ad. It might make a candidate an asshole and a bigot to spread unfounded rumors that your opponent is gay, but on the next page is where the real insight into the Republican party is: Irony: Mailer against a Hotze-backed candidate, @BriscoeCain, says he should be kept out of men s bathrooms #TxLege pic.twitter.com/wLOzL3nQRY  Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016The transgender bathroom laws that are popping up across the country are not specifically about transgender people. Once the Supreme Court ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land, anti-gay bigots had to take their fight elsewhere. Besides, gay marriage might not be so bad if you don t actually have to see people *gasp* holding hands or *I feel faint* kissing. What s a better way to keep people out of the public than to ban them from using public restrooms?If you think this is a bit of a stretch, think about the bathroom laws themselves. Imagine a very masculine looking man, who happened to have been born with a vagina. Do women, who already see predators around every corner, really want to share a bathroom with him? Should a woman, feminine in every way except for what s between her legs, be forced to use the men s room? Of course not. Anti-LGBT conservatives don t want them to use the bathroom at all, just like Briscoe Cain s opponent doesn t want him in bathrooms.Yes, this is just one person, but this guy (unfortunately, not a Republican) feels that gay people should have their own bathrooms. You know, separate, but equal.Here are a few more charmers:Keep the freaks, perverts, and Fags out of the bathrooms!! https://t.co/owUwDcjhGz  Lisa Smith (@JuliaKi96952130) May 9, 2016 i m not against gender neutral bathrooms, but can we get a faggot only restroom?For all the fags.

5153," After Republicans Gut Zika Funding, Rubio Says Infected Women Can’t Have Abortions","Republicans claim to be  pro-life,  but one needs only observe to realize that they simply like babies   as long as they are in the womb, that is. Sure, they repeatedly cut funding from programs that feed poor children and actively work to deny kids health care and other necessities   but they sure love promoting abstinence-only sex  education,  which actually increases unwanted pregnancies, and depriving women of the ability to decide whether or not to abort a fetus.Zika is believed to cause severe birth defects like microcephaly, which causes severe brain and skull deformities and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first year alone. As the GOP wants to deprive poor women of health care, if they had their way these expenses would be crippling. This doesn t even take into account the extra care a child would need, the exhaustion involved in caring for a critically-ill baby, or a number of other factors that would cause someone with the Zika virus to make the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy.The state of Florida is currently facing a Zika crisis, but that doesn t stop Senator Marco Rubio from sticking to his guns on abortion. To him, women should never be allowed to have one, even in the cases of rape and incest   and not even if the mother has contracted the Zika virus. He told Politico on Saturday: I understand a lot of people disagree with my view   but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I m going to err, I m going to err on the side of life. Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it s a lifetime of difficulties,  Rubio added.  So I get it. I m not pretending to you that that s an easy question you asked me. But I m pro-life. And I m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life. No matter how much the child suffers, right, Marco?Rubio himself voted to fulfill President Obama s request for funding, so he is aware that there is an issue. He s not hiding from that. But his belief in a book written by a bunch of men who couldn t figure out where the sun hides at night, as well as his devotion to the very party that actively fights to keep women sick, prevents him from accepting the fact that women have the right to make their own health care decisions   including terminating a pregnancy if they have the Zika virus.Meanwhile, as Republicans continue to hold funding hostage over gutting the Clean Water Act and letting truckers drive for longer hours without a break (yes, seriously), Rubio and his ilk will continue to fight against women s right to choose an abortion to save the child from a lifetime of suffering.Featured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle",News,"August 6, 2016",life womb work health care abstinence sex education ability fetus birth microcephaly brain year health care way account care child exhaustion baby number someone virus decision pregnancy state crisis stop senator abortion rape incest mother virus politico lot people view life protection context condition question side life condition lifetime question life life life law irrespective condition life matter child marco president request issue belief book bunch men figure sun night devotion party fact right health care pregnancy virus hostage water act yes ilk abortion child lifetime suffering image
15878,WELCOME TO AMERICA: Most Refugees Are On Food Stamps…And That’s Not All!,"A strikingly high percentage of refugees to the United States use some form of public assistance, according to a government report to Congress.The Office of Refugee Resettlement s Annual Report to Congress for FY2013 reveals that nearly 4 of 5 refugees were on food stamps.Additionally, nearly half were on some form of cash assistance and more than a half were on medical assistance. More than 20 percent were on Supplemental Security Income, more than 22 percent were in public housing and nearly 20 percent were on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).The report noted that many households received more than one type of assistance and the data dealt with refugees who arrived in the U.S. between March 1, 2008 to February 28, 2013.To be sure, assistance use varied among region of origin.Refugees from Africa and the Middle East were the heaviest users of cash assistance at 61.9 percent and 68.3 percent respectively. Latin American refugees only used cash assistance at a rate of 8.1 percent and South Asia used about 42.7 percent. Data for Europe and the former Soviet Union was not available.The use of food stamps   or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   also varied with 88.9 percent of refugees from Africa, 91.4 percent of Middle Eastern refugees, the Middle East, 72.9 percent of South Asia, and 36.7 percent of Latin American refugees using the benefit.Overall, according to the report just 50 percent of refugee households in the five year window were self-sufficient. Approximately 50 percent of all sampled refugee households in the 2013 survey were entirely self-sufficient (subsisted on earnings alone),  the report reads.  About 39 percent lived on a combination of public assistance and earned income; another eight percent received only public assistance.

21256,SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED To Step Foot On American Soil: How Female Terrorist Used Fake Info To Get US Visa,"CAN WE JUST STOP ALLOWING Muslim Refugees and visitors into U.S. from countries who hate us already? How about we focus on the 1% of Pakistani s who are Christian that face daily persecution at the hands of Muslims?UPDATE: Tashfeen Malik posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS before her deadly attack. She used a fake address on her passport.Via ABC:For the visa application, the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown, ABC News discovered today, does not exist. Malik received a her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said.Tashfeen Malik, the female terrorist involved in the San Bernardino attack should have never been granted an American visa if the Immigration and Nationality Act holds any weight.Malik, who was found to have a Pakistani passport, obtained the K-1 visa in Islamabad, Pakistan. However, American visa laws that are meant to detect potential terror threats trying to infiltrate the country should have blocked the female jihadist from obtaining that visa.As the Center for Immigration Services notes, Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that  individuals who appear likely to overstay their temporary visas and try to settle permanently in the United States are not to be issued one. The regulation is meant to detect individuals seeking a visa who do not have permanent families in their home country and whether or not they have enough money to travel back to their home country once their visa is expired.This screening process is meant to expose individuals trying to to get into the country for the purpose of resettling permanently and overstaying their visa, as so many do.Nonetheless, Malik was able to obtain a visa in Islamabad despite the screening process which should have detected the fact that she was a young woman resettling in the US to potentially raise a family with her radical jihadist husband Syed Farook.Malik passed her DHS screening:Under Section 214(b), Malik should have been denied a visa, as there was ample evidence that she would overstay her visa.But, Malik could have obtained her visa the same way the 9/11 hijackers obtained theirs: through the  Visa Express  program.As reported by The Hayride, the Visa Express program allowed 9/11 hijackers Abdulaziz Alomari, Salem al Hamzi, and Khalid al Midhar to obtain their visas in Saudi Arabia without even being interviewed by consular officials at the American consulate.The terrorists simply obtained their visas by sending officials their applications and supporting documents through a designated travel agency.This allowed the three terrorists to go undetected despite red-flags that they were single, young men with not enough funds to return back to their home countries once their visas expired.Likewise, if Malik gained her visa through the  Visa Express  program at the American consulate in Islamabad, it would explain how she was allowed to enter the country despite overwhelming suspicions that she would overstay her visa.The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) admits that there are so many visas given out each year around the world that it is impossible to conduct background checks on every single person.And, we all saw what happened yesterday in San Bernardino.Via: Gateway Pundit",left-news,"Dec 4, 2015",persecution malik pledge allegiance attack address passport application address news today malik card summer malik terrorist attack visa immigration nationality act malik passport visa visa terror country visa center immigration section immigration nationality act regulation visa home country money home country visa screening process country purpose visa visa screening process fact woman family husband malik section malik visa evidence visa malik way visa express program visa express program al al consulate travel agency men funds home malik visa visa express program consulate country visa immigration naturalization service year world background person yesterday gateway pundit
5491, Paul Ryan Gets Called Out At Town Hall And Gives THE DUMBEST Reason For Supporting Trump (VIDEO),"House Speaker Paul Ryan was put on the spot last night during CNN s town hall, when a Republican attendee asked him a question that most of us would love to know   how can anyone, Republican or not, justify standing by Donald Trump after all the horrible things he s said and done?Student Zachary Marcone, who stressed that he himself was a Republican but would NOT be voting for Trump, confronted Ryan by pointing out Trump s bigotry. Marcone said: It concerns me when the Republican leadership is supporting somebody who s blatantly racist and has said Islamophobic statements, wants to shut down our borders. Can you tell me, how can you morally justify your support for this kind of candidate, somebody who could be very destructive to our country? Ryan couldn t actually give Marcone a moral justification for why he continued to support Trump even though he d condemned several of the Islamophobic things Trump has said in the past. Basically accepting Marcone s description of Trump as a racist Islamophobic candidate, Ryan s only response was that carrying out the Republican party s agenda was more important to him than protecting America. Ryan fired back with notable irritation in his voice: That basically means you re going to help elect Hillary Clinton. And I don t think Hillary Clinton s going to support any of the things that you stand for, if you re a Republican.  So according to the Speaker of the House, subjecting America to a blatantly racist and Islamophobic idiot isn t as bad as having Clinton leading the country   even though she is far more qualified to do so and Ryan admitted that several of Trump s proposals were  wrong  and  don t reflect the view of fellow conservatives and Republicans.  Ryan said: She represents a third Obama term. I don t think that s good for America; I think that s the wrong direction. So, yes, things have been said that I, too, disagree with. Then I ll make that point, then, but I m going to go fight for the principles and these solutions that I believe in. And the candidate that I think is so much more likely to put those into law, because I know Hillary Clinton won t do that. It is a binary choice. It is either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. You don t get a third option. It s one or the other and I know where I want to go.

3013, WATCH: Michael Steele CALLS OUT Trump For Attacking Civil Rights Icon Rep. John Lewis,"Former RNC chair Michael Steele did not mince words when he called out Donald Trump on Saturday.Rep. John Lewis, who nearly sacrificed his life fighting for voting rights in Selma, Alabama during the Civil Right Movement, remarked on Friday during an interview with Chuck Todd that he doesn t believe Trump is a legitimate president. I believe in trying to work with people,  Lewis said.  It will be hard. It s going to be very difficult. I don t see this president-elect as a legitimate president. Of course, Trump s ego couldn t handle the truth so he lashed out in the most embarrassing way.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Trump literally accused Lewis of being  all talk  and  no action. Unlike Trump, Lewis has spent his life fighting for equality and civil rights. He was even nearly beaten to death for it. Meanwhile, Trump has never fought for a damn thing except for himself.Trump s attack on Lewis also coincides with Martin Luther King Day weekend, which made his attack all the more offensive, and Steele put Trump in his place during an appearance on MSNBC. Number one, don t tweet that. Number two, don t go there. And number three, try and step back and appreciate what s being said,  Steele advised Trump.  You can put it in a partisan context. You know,  He s a Democrat, I m a Republican. He s black, I m white.  It goes to what you were just saying, what s undergirding that? Steele then reminded Trump that if he really wants to heal wounds and bridge divides that he needs to include African-Americans. Instead, Trump just widened that divide by attacking a civil rights legend. If you re looking to heal and bridge, and bring people of America together, well, we re a part of that. As black folks, we re apart of that. Our expectation is, not only will you attempt that same effort that you would to white folks in other communities, but that you will show respect for our leadership, those who do represent our interests. You know, the tweet is unnecessary. John Lewis has a walk that very few people in this country, least of all Donald Trump, have ever walked. In short, Lewis walked the walk while Trump does nothing but talk.Here s the video via Twitter.

8285," Jeb Bush Finally Got The Best Of Trump, Until Trump Hushed Him Like A Toddler (VIDEO)","If you have the stomach to actually follow the Republican debates that seem to happen every other day now, you know that Jeb Bush has a singular mission at this point in his campaign: Attack Donald Trump. Bush, long considered the establishment favorite to win the Republican nomination, has been pushed around by Trump since the very first debate with very little success at firing back.That s not for a lack of trying. Bush, whose natural posture is slumpy and whose speech is frumpy, can t help but look like a bullied kid when he tries to defend himself against Trump. His debate performances have been so lackluster he was even scolded publicly by his Mommy, who probably wishes she had another Dubya right about now. The dumber brother obviously got all of the charisma.This latest round of  attack each other and say Hillary Clinton  a lot   also known as a  debate    saw Jeb finally come up with a successful attack against Trump. When Trump started talking about the government taking private property by eminent domain to construct roads and bridges, Jeb fired back with a story about Trump s attempt to take the property of an elderly woman in Atlantic City by eminent domain so he could provide a nice parking lot for limousines outside one of his casinos.Jeb had the crowd fired up. Finally, an exchange between Trump and Jeb was going his way. That is until Trump was offered the opportunity to respond. As Trump tried to  make America great  his way out of yet another sordid detail of his past, Jeb chimed in, interrupting him mid-sentence, only to be shushed by Trump, who had already twice asserted that Jeb  wanted to be a tough guy. After his shushing of a grown man, which admittedly was a bit hilarious, Trump got his share of boos, hitting back hard with  that s all of his supporters and special interests.

A very offensive depiction of police hands in the U.S. Capitol complex, and Missouri Rep. William Lacy Clay is drawing heat for placing it there.For several months the painting, called  Untitled #1,  has hung in the House building connecting hall, depicting police as animals seemingly engaged in the act of brutalizing minorities.  BPRIn February 2015, Democratic Congressman Clay suggested that prosecutors are responsible for fixing outcome of racially charged cases that involve cops when he claimed that in Ferguson and in Garner s death  we saw an all-too-familiar pattern of local prosecutors who work hand-in-hand with police every day, essentially prewiring the grand jury process to produce a known outcome. In a released statement, Clay said,  Members of Congress support student art competitions in our districts but we do not select the young artists and we do not judge the artwork. I had no role in selecting the winner of this student art competition and I would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression. The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship. The young artist chose his own subject and the painting will not be removed. He also told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that the painting was  the most creative expression that I ve witnessed in the last 16 years.

6430, It’s Happening: Trump Says Rudy Giuliani Will Head ‘Commission’ To Figure Out How To Ban Muslims,"As the creeping realization that Donald J. Trump is, in fact, the Republican nominee slowly dawns on conservatives, there has been a new push to re-frame the candidate as more  presidential  and more  serious  than people had originally thought. This requires a level of mental gymnastics that would qualify for the Olympics. While Trump s backers   and some in the media   continue to insist Trump is  shifting  towards maturity, he keeps emphatically insisting that he really is the racist, xenophobic blowhard he originally postured himself as.Consider this: Just one day after the newly elected mayor of London publicly humiliated Trump over his abhorrent plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Trump was on increasingly pro-Trump Fox News to announce his latest Big Plan for when he s president: A tribunal run by Rudy Giuliani with the sole purpose of working out what to do about the Muslim  problem. We have a president that won t even use the term  radical Islamic terrorism.  He won t use the term. He refuses to say the term, even after Paris where 130 people were killed or San Bernardino or any other place. It s a real problem. So we ll figure it out, and we will get it going. But we have to be extremely careful. In fact, I m thinking about setting up a commission perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani to take a very serious look at this problem. But this is a worldwide problem, and we have to be smart.Giuliani, famous for his handling of New York City s response after 9/11, has spent the last decade and a half growing increasingly fanatical. In recent years it s not uncommon to see him on Fox News complaining about black people and Muslims in ways that sometimes even make the conservative hosts blush.Giuliani is now Trump s go to guy on Islamophobia. When the candidate spuriously claimed that  thousands  of Muslim Americans were cheering on 9/11, Giuliani quickly rushed onto CNN to describe, in vivid detail, one such example. We had one situation in which a candy store owned by a Muslim family was celebrating that day, right near a housing development. And the kids in the housing development came in and beat them up.And, I think both facts were corroborated to be true. Because they were celebrating that the towers were coming down, some of the kids got really upset about it and they came in and did a pretty good job of beating them up. Except those  facts  were not true. What Giuliani was referring to turned out to be an anti-Muslim hate crime. Here s what really happened that day:Yesterday I saw first-hand how anger over the World Trade Center attack turns on Muslims who call New York home. At 4:30 p.m. on 116th St., five black teenagers stopped in front of the American Muslim Community of East Harlem site   a closet-sized candy store with a make-shift mosque in a back room. Tiny store owner Muhammad Chaudhry stood in the doorway. One of the teenage boys asked him,  Do you feel sorry for America? The kid then gave Chaudhry a knock-out punch in the face that sent him reeling backwards and onto the floor.This man, whose hatred for Muslims made him misremember a hate crime to fit his warped view, will now be tasked with solving Trump s fabricated Muslim  problem.  That is a very scary thought.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",realization trump fact nominee push candidate people level gymnastics trump media trump towards maturity racist blowhard consider day mayor trump abhorrent plan trump trump fox news plan president run purpose problem president term terrorism term term people place problem fact commission look problem problem handling york city response decade half fox news people ways candidate detail example situation candy store family day housing development housing development job hate crime day yesterday hand anger world trade center attack york home front community site closet candy store make shift mosque room tiny store owner doorway teenage knock punch face backwards floor man hate crime view trump problem thought image ralph
17273,LEFTIST PROF WHO WANTS “Earth Constitution” Will Speak At Vatican Rollout Of Papal Document On Phony ‘Global Warming’,"Why would the Vatican invite an aggressive leftist speaker to the rollout of the Pope s Papal document on phony  global climate change?  As a Catholic, the news about the Pope s support of these horrible leftists and their radical agenda is heartbreaking. Pray for our nation One of the speakers slated for the Vatican rollout of the long-awaited Papal document on climate change once said the earth is overpopulated by at least 6 billion people.The teaching document, called an encyclical, is scheduled for release on June 18 at Vatican City. Perhaps with the exception of the 1968 encyclical on contraception, no Vatican document has been greeted with such anticipation.The political left is hoping for a document that ties belief in global warming to a religious obligation. Climate skeptics have already started criticizing the document.The choice of Professor John Schnellnhuber, founding director of the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, as one of three presenters may be giving the left added hope and giving giving skeptics severe heartburn. He has been described as one of the more aggressive scientists on the question of man-made global warming.In a talk given to what s described as the  failed  2009 Copenhagen climate conference, reported in the New York Times, Schnellnhuber, who has advised German President Angela Merkel and is a visiting professor at Oxford, said of global warming:  In a very cynical way, it s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something  - namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people. Schnellnhuber is also author of what s called the  two-degree target  that says governments must not allow the temperature to rise more than 2 degrees higher than at the start of the industrial revolution. Any higher, the theory holds, and much life on earth would either perish or be gravely harmed.To deal with climate issues, he has also called for an  Earth Constitution that would transcend the UN Charter  along with the creation of a  Global Council elected by all the people on Earth  and a  Planetary Court..a transnational legal body open to appeals from everybody, especially with respect to violations of the Earth Constitution.

21102,SUPREME COURT AGREES TO TAKE ON Obama’s Un-American Plan To Shield Millions Of Illegals From Deportation,"So far, the Supreme Court has not prevented one single unconstitutional act committed by Obama. Is there any reason to believe they will stop the invasion of illegals to save America and the American worker?The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to review President Obama s plan to shield up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation, after lower courts blocked the president s sweeping executive actions from taking effect.The decision sets up an election-year clash over the controversial plan that many Republicans have likened to  amnesty. The justices said Tuesday they will consider undoing lower court rulings that blocked the plan from taking effect. The Obama administration had appealed to the Supreme Court last fall.The decision to review the case may be welcome on both sides of the aisle. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, of Utah, issued a statement praising the court for taking it on   and urging the justices to rule against the administration. President Obama s executive action is an affront to our system of republican self-government,  Hatch said.  The Constitution vests legislative authority in Congress, not the President. With his actions, President Obama has attempted to bypass the constitutionally ordained legislative process and rewrite the law unilaterally. The case probably will be argued in April and decided by late June, about a month before both parties  presidential nominating conventions. The issue of illegal immigration has taken a center-stage role in the Republican primary battle, as Donald Trump calls for a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and candidates spar over who is toughest on the issue.The immigrants who would benefit from the Obama administration s plan are mainly the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.But more than two-dozen mostly Republican-led states challenged Obama s executive actions after they were rolled out in 2014, and the plan has been tied up in litigation ever since.Critics say the plan is unconstitutional. Shortly before the administration took the case to the Supreme Court, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the states in early November.Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. later said in a court filing that allowing those rulings to stand would force millions of people  to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families. At issue is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which Obama said would allow people who have been in the United States more than five years and who have children who are in the country legally to  come out of the shadows and get right with the law.

4634, NYPD So Delighted With Cop Who Killed Eric Garner They Now Pay Him $120K,"Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes. There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests. Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records. He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime. An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation. Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released. This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge. So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com:  Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights. He was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the NYPD banned the practice. In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver. So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise.

It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump.Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country.  After that, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future line up to torture Trump in the Oval Office.The Ghost of Christmas Past is fired NBC host Billy Bush (Alex Moffat), of Trump s infamous  grab em by the pussy  tape. Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all! You have no idea how long I ve wanted to say this,  lock him up! Lock him up indeed. This entire criminal administration belongs in jail. It will go from Flynn, to Pence, to Trump Jr., and then to Trump himself   and then Hillary will really have the last laugh.",News,"December 3, 2017",everyone security adviser trump course night live trump excuse president midst holiday season classic carol fun trump alec mantle trump day ghost time clean good country present future line trump office ghost past host trump grab em pussy tape time shirtless beck bennet trump fact president help government ghost future version gift idea lock lock administration jail laugh
6383, A Congressman Wrote A Book Anonymously That Is Guaranteed To P*ss You Off,"84 pages of how the United States House of Representatives really works is set to be released by a small Minnesota publisher on May 24th. The tell-all, written by a sitting US congressman rumored to be a Democrat, confirms the storied we ve heard and adds a few new twists to how life as a  public servant  actually works opposed to the facade of friendly people in nice clothes who shake your hand and care deeply for your needs, whatever they may be.First let s start off by saying that like anything, there are exceptions to the rule. There s gonna be a district of good people somewhere who have elected a man or a woman who genuinely cares about their municipalities and their lives and improving them no matter what. There are far more, however, nefarious career con artists who have seen first hand through their families or learned coming up the ladder that congressional politics is, for the most part, all or nothing scumbaggery. They know the system and are bred for it. Confessions of a Congressman  set to be released May 24   AmazonThis particular congressman has decided that through anonymity he (says he s a he but could be a she?) will only honestly and openly describe the life of a US Representative at the expense of letting the people know exactly how he   and most of his colleagues   view the American public. DailyMail.com reports having seen the book, using these bullet points to describe the contents:As disturbing as that sounds, it isn t really all that far off from how many Americans already view congress. Their approval rating barely hits double digits. They do nothing. Partisan politics and campaigning have replaced governing in America. There are good people coming up with great ideas being squashed by people like this guy who buy their way through life one election at a time, hoping to someday get the call to the upper chamber where all that fundraising can be replaced with a few years of vacation in between. Maybe someday someone will find out you have the right look for a presidential run.It would be impossible to eliminate politics from government. Limiting the amount of time a particular politician can remain in office, however, would go far towards removing people like the selfish bastard who wrote this book and everyone else who has turned Capitol Hill into 535 ongoing campaigns.Featured image via Wikipedia/thirstynyc.com",News,"May 14, 2016",house publisher tell congressman democrat life servant facade people clothes hand care deeply needs anything rule district people man woman matter career con hand ladder politics part nothing system congressman congressman anonymity life representative expense people book bullet contents disturbing approval rating nothing politics governing people people guy way life election time call chamber vacation someone look run politics government amount time politician office towards people bastard book everyone hill image

20113,"MEDIA IMMEDIATELY REPORTS Alleged Killer Of Imam, Assistant Was Catholic…Takes Days To ID Religion Of Muslims Who Commit Acts Of Terror In US [VIDEO]","There is no question that the killing of any innocent human is a tragedy. So how is it that the media determines just how much of a tragedy each unjust killing is? When 13 US Army members were murdered by Nidal Hassan, a Muslim psychiatrist who worked on the same US Army base, why did it take the media so long to report about his allegiance to radical Islam or his cries of  Alluha Akbar  as he slaughtered and wounded unsuspecting military members? Should the media have kept his devotion to Islam from the public in order to protect members of his faith from unjust persecution?  Only months ago, Obama s Attorney General Loretta Lynch threatened to punish anyone who used what the DOJ considers  hate speech  against Muslims, but never mentioned Christians, Hindus or Jews. Why did the media identify the CATHOLIC faith of the Hispanic man who killed the NY Muslim Imam and his assistant within hours of his capture, while hiding the faith of Muslims who commit acts of terror against Americans? Why does the media and our government go out of their way to protect members of the Muslim community, while racing to  out  the alleged Catholic Hispanic killer?Where were the large crowds of Mulsims protesting the  hate  after 9-11 in NY? Where were they after the worst mass murder in American history by radical Muslim Omar Mateen in Orlando?The suspect accused of murdering an imam and his assistant in New York had  hatred  toward Muslims after 9/11, his brother has said   as police investigate whether he was hired as a hitman. Hispanic Oscar Morel, 35, of Brooklyn, was charged Monday night with two counts of second-degree for the killings of Imam Maulana Alauddin Akonjee and Thara Uddin after cops say they recovered what they believe is the gun at his home.Investigators found clothes similar to those worn by the gunman in surveillance video of the killing stuffed into the wall of the suspect s home along with the weapon.Police and the Queens District Attorney would not say why Morel has not been charged with first degree murder   but it may be because it will be easier to upgrade the charges at a later stage.Morel worked as a janitor at The New School, a private university in New York, and was brought up in a Catholic family.His brother Alvin told the New York Post his brother was furious after attack on the Twin Towers   but insisted it was only  temporary .He said:  The only time we ever felt anything was 9/11,  Alvin Morel said.  We felt that same anger. We all had a hatred. The New York Daily News also reported that detectives were working on the theory that somebody hired Morel as a hit man.Police have not yet speculated on a motive, though New York Police Department s chief of detectives said the possibility that the murders were a hate crime is  certainly on the table .After his arrest, more information about Morel and the shooting were revealed:Morel, 35, is Hispanic, went to Catholic school and worked as a private university janitorHe has been charged with second-degree murder and will be arraigned at Queens Criminal Court on Tuesday morningSecond degree murder means the killing was not pre-meditated, but the charges could be upgraded Morel told police he was in the area at the time of the slaying and admitted he was the man in the surveillance video   but said he didn t shoot anyone The NYPD have said:  We strongly believe this is the individual They expressed confidence after detectives found a gun and clothes similar stuffed into the wall of Morel s homeHis brother said he had animosity towards Muslims after 9/11, but it had subsided Alvin Morel also said his brother was a  good guy  and was in disbelief at what happened Muslims in the community where the imam and his assistant were killed say they have been harassed Residents in the Bangladeshi-Muslim community in Queens and Brooklyn have described harassment in recent months by people who shouted anti-Muslim epithets.But Morel s brother said:  We re Catholic-school kids   we don t do this. He s a good guy. He also added on Facebook:  I cant believe what has happened. I don t believe whats injustice. GOD help my brother mother father and my self. Boyce added:  We believe, because of the evidence we ve acquired thus far, that we strongly believe this is the individual. Some have said that the men being shot in the head could have been the result of a feud between Muslims and Hispanics.The arrest was announced just hours after about 1,000 people gathered under tents to praise Akonjee, 55, and Uddin, 64, in an Islamic funeral service where emotions ran high.The ceremony featured several speakers who said they believed the victims were targeted because of their religion. Some members of the congregation shouted,  Justice!  periodically throughout the service.After the ceremony, part of the crowd marched to the spot a few blocks away where the shooting took place.Mayor Bill de Blasio told those gathered that the entire city was  mourning with you. Some in the largely Bangladeshi Muslim community in Queens and Brooklyn have described harassment in recent months by people who shouted anti-Muslim epithets.Read more:Daily Mail",left-news,"Aug 16, 2016",question killing human tragedy media tragedy killing psychiatrist base media allegiance media devotion public order faith persecution attorney lynch anyone speech media faith man imam assistant capture faith terror media government way community catholic killer hate mass murder history suspect imam assistant york brother police investigate night degree gun home clothes gunman surveillance video stuffed wall home weapon police district attorney morel murder stage morel janitor school university york family brother york post brother attack twin time anything morel anger york news theory somebody morel hit man police york police department chief possibility hate crime table arrest information morel shooting morel school university degree murder court murder killing morel police area time slaying man surveillance video shoot anyone individual confidence gun clothes wall morel brother animosity towards morel brother guy disbelief community imam assistant community harassment people brother school guy whats god help brother mother father self evidence men head result feud arrest people service ceremony religion congregation justice service ceremony part crowd spot shooting place mayor bill city community harassment people mail
23177,The Wahabi Vote: Poll Shows 68 percent of Saudis prefer Hillary Clinton,"21st Century Wire says Another key swing state has gone to Hillary. The feudal theocratic dictatorship who is funding and supporting ISIS and al Qaeda terrorists groups groups globally   has chosen their candidate  According to one WikiLeaks email, Clinton herself discussed how Gulf monarchies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are  providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,  Clinton wrote. This effort will be enhanced by the stepped up commitment in the [Kurdish Regional Government]. The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. So the Clinton Foundation has been knowingly accepting millions of dollars in donations from the very same Gulf states that both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and many other known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations currently infesting Syria and Iraq.No wonder Clinton plays so well with Saudi Arabia Al Arabiya An opinion poll by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Washington and that included nine Arab countries revealed that 68 percent of the Saudis prefer that Hillary Clinton wins the presidential elections while 46 percent thought Donald Trump was bad.The nine countries included Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco, Jordan, Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza Strip), Saudi Arabia and Tunisia and an average of 400 people from each country participated in the questionnaire.Asked which of the candidates will positively influence the US policy towards the Arab region, 65 percent of the Saudis said Clinton s victory will positively impact the Arab region.The Arab public opinion prefers Clinton s win by 66 percent while 11 percent prefer Trump s victory. The highest percentage in support of Clinton winning the presidency was in Morocco and Tunisia while the least percentage in favor of Clinton s victory was in Palestine and Iraq. Meanwhile, the highest percentage in favor of Trump winning was in Iraq and Egypt Continue this story at Al ArabiyaREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2o16 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"November 8, 2016",century wire key state dictatorship al candidate support state para operation intelligence assets pressure support region effort commitment government position policy competition world pressure foundation millions gulf secretary president al front al wonder opinion poll center research policy percent percent trump morocco jordan west bank strip average people country questionnaire policy region percent victory region opinion win percent percent prefer trump victory percentage support presidency morocco percentage favor victory percentage favor trump winning story election news century wire subscribe member
3253, Trump Just Claimed He Beat Obama In The Election And Got RIPPED APART By Twitter (TWEETS),"Donald Trump can t let it go. A broken and antiquated system that exists solely to benefit slave-owning states by increasing the value of their residents  votes while devaluing everyone else s   the Electoral College   allowed him to become President despite his opponent trouncing him in the popular vote, and he still isn t satisfied because he failed to travel back in time and vanquish his true nemesis: President Obama.Ever since he recently claimed that he could have beaten the President if he ran against him, Trump has been the subject of mockery   but on Tuesday, his delusion came to a head when he claimed he had actually beaten Obama, who could not and did not run in 2016.

8912, Jeb Bush Blames Bad Parenting For Black Crime: Says His Own Kids’ Crimes ‘Not His Fault’ (VIDEO),"Earlier this year, Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, which were tied to predatory policing of African-Americans that led to murder-by-cop.Via Think Progress:During a Q & A with employees of the pharmaceutical company Nephron, his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. Kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning,  Bush said.  They ve never been challenged to achieve far better. They ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better. You see what happens in Baltimore and Ferguson. You see the tragedies play out. You see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific. Jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege-ridden Republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the African-American community   blame the parents.Fast forward 7 months later:During an interview with CBS Miami, the topic of Jeb s daughter Noelle came up. Jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs. The interviewer specifically asked if Jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as Governor,  if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems.Listen to Jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via CBS Miami:  I can t blame myself. That s not gonna solve any problems, and you just can t do that. Jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity. However, as you saw above, if you are black and live in a city that means it s YOUR family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity.Here is some history on Jeb s daughter. In 2002, Noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a Xanax prescription in Tallahassee. A judge sentenced her to rehab. In July 2002, she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program. In October 2002, Noelle was jailed again for 10 more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center. In 2003, she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since.These are 3 crimes that were drug related in less than one year. She spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it.It s relevant to know that during Jeb s first year as Florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors, including a 3-year minimum for as little as 4 grams of heroin. He also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses. Bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed 10,000 drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs. Somehow Jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield.One final bit of annoyance Jeb s son George P. Bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend s home while drunk when he was 18 years old. He walked when charges were not pressed.What an elitist Republican jerk   Jeb Bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems, while laying ALL the problems African-American people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",year hopeful bush question think progress company response question mass country bush kind sense people privilege response part community interview topic daughter interviewer daughter past interviewer time home tenure governor time family daughter response video family daughter drug activity city family fault activity history daughter prescription judge days probation program days possession crack cocaine center program job drug year jail total year governor law drug year minimum heroin implementation treatment jail drug bush ballot measure drug jail enroll treatment daughter bit annoyance son bush ex home drunk jerk bush capacity hypocrisy contempt people people life image
17545,JUST IN: “Pit Bull” Attorney For Special Counsel Robert Mueller Attended Hillary’s Election Night Party,"Is there a single person left on Robert Mueller s  Trump-Russian collusion  team who isn t in bed with Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton?An attorney for special counsel Robert Mueller attended Hillary Clinton s election night party in New York City, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.Andrew Weissmann s attendance at the party is one of many signs pointing to a troubling bias from the attorney. Weissmann has been described by The New York Times as Mueller s  lieutenant  and  pit bull. Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained an email Tuesday that revealed Weissmann praised former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates  defiance of Trump. I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects,  Weissmann wrote to Yates on Jan. 30. The email followed Yates  instruction to the DOJ not to defend an executive order banning immigration from seven nations, an act that led to her dismissal by President Trump.Weissmann is one of several Democratic donors that have been hired by Mueller, a registered Republican. The special counsel s  pit bull  donated a combined $6,600 to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.The special counsel s probe has been criticized by Trump s allies, but the White House maintains Trump has no intention to fire Mueller.

4380, BUSTED: Donald Trump Screwed Over American Steel Workers By Buying Metal From China Instead,"Donald Trump claims he will  make America great again,  but what he really means is he will continue helping China destroy America.In yet another example of how Trump has screwed over American workers in order to enrich himself and his own family, Newsweek has revealed that the Republican nominee purchased steel and other metals from China to use in the construction of his buildings instead of buying it from American companies. A Newsweek investigation has found that in at least two of Trump s last three construction projects, Trump opted to purchase his steel and aluminum from Chinese manufacturers rather than United States corporations based in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,  Kurt Eichenwald wrote.Eichenwald painstakingly discovered that Trump built his Trump International Hotel Las Vegas by ditching American steel companies in favor of cheaper steel produced by Chinese companies who pay their workers less. The Chinese entity chosen by Trump to provide steel for the Las Vegas property is a holding company called Ossen Innovation Co. Ltd. formerly known as Ultra Glory International Ltd,  Newsweek found under  layers upon layers of corporate shells and divisions  that ultimately led to Ossen (Jiujiang) Steel Wire & Cable Co. Ltd., which operates in Shanghai. Trump was apparently trying to hide where he purchased the steel by using this strategy.For his Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the Republican nominee acquired the vast amounts of aluminum material used from Chinese companies as well, which deprived American smelters of money that could have prevented producers in Ohio, West Virginia and Texas from closing their doors and putting Americans out of work. Newsweek estimates that  American companies lost out on more than $350 million in sales. Again, Trump tried to bury where he purchased the aluminum, but some digging revealed that the chain leads to Permasteelisa South China Factory and Permasteelisa Hong Kong Limited.Trump s actions put Americans out of work and helped foreign companies in China eliminate their American competitors. As Eichenwald explained, The losers are the American competitors like aluminum producers who cannot possibly compete with foreign companies that are willing to take losses on the sales of their building materials in hopes of driving companies in the United States out of business. And they succeeded in driving American companies out of business because greedy businessmen like Donald Trump care more about profit than they do about the American workers they hurt.Instead, Chinese companies reap the benefits. The Chinese economy is surpassing our own as the largest in the world. And Donald Trump is helping them do it without any remorse whatsoever.Eventually, as American companies are continually forced to shut down because they can t compete, these Chinese companies will likely raise their prices through the roof and create a shortage of steel here in the United States that will hurt construction companies and many others connected to them, resulting in more Americans losing their jobs. It s a vicious cycle that Donald Trump has helped perpetuate for years in the name of profit.But for some reason many conservatives still actually believe Donald Trump is going to somehow bring jobs back to America and make our economy stronger than ever, even though he is a huge part of the problem in the first place. In the end, China is not to blame for our weaker economy and jobs being outsourced to other countries. That s being made in America by selfish wealthy pricks like Donald Trump.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 3, 2016",trump destroy example trump order family nominee steel china construction investigation trump construction steel aluminum michigan trump hotel las steel favor steel entity trump steel las property company innovation glory steel wire cable trump steel strategy hotel tower nominee aluminum material money west work aluminum digging chain factory hong trump work china aluminum building business business trump care profit economy world trump remorse roof shortage steel construction cycle trump name profit reason trump bring economy part problem place end china economy pricks trump image
3081, Facebook Troll EXCITED For Obamacare Repeal Is On ‘Affordable Care Act’; Irony ABOUNDS (IMAGE),"It what can only be seen as a situation where you want to feel bad for a person, but really don t, one supporter of repealing Obamacare just learned the hard way that they re against their own healthcare.All names have been blacked out, so pardon the anonymity. However, Helen Kennedy from Twitter seemed to get her hands on the really sad conversation.It began with a post on Facebook from this someone who is against  Obamacare  and posted the vote and said: One step closer to fixing this mistake, and only a couple weeks left of Barry s regime. 2017 is already looking up. This is when it gets sad. Someone pointed out that repealing the Affordable Care Act will strip health aid from those who desperately need it. This is when the person responds:  First we re talking about Obamacare, not the ACA. Secondly, my health insurance is through the ACA, so I m definitely not the kind of person to look down on others for needing help This is when someone points out to this person that they re on Obamacare, which is just another name for the Affordable Care Act.This original posters replies: I m not on Obamacare. My health insurance is through the ACA (Affordable Care Act), which was what they had to come up with after Obamacare crashed and burned as bad as it did. So I m gonna be fine. Then response after response came in explaining that they are, in fact, the same thing. And as of the screengrab, the original poster hadn t responded.Here s the tweet:Facebook nitwit celebrating Obamacare repeal finds out Obamacare is another name for the ACA he depends on. pic.twitter.com/ehStqChXqq  Helen Kennedy (@HelenKennedy) January 9, 2017This makes you wonder how many people out there really don t know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing. And it s actually kind of sad. They ve been spoon fed lies by Republicans to hate the very thing they are now reliant on just by calling it another name that associates it with Obama. Which, by the way, is the only reason they want the repeal, so Obama doesn t have the legislative victory.This poor person.

The 51 year-old nurse, who has helped asylum seekers in the past, was shocked by the news.Bettina Halbey, who lives alone in the small town of Nieheim, received a letter from her landlord and the local municipality at the start of September, Die Welt newspaper reported on Thursday. I was completely shocked and I can t even begin to find the words to describe how the city has treated me,  Halbey told the German publication.  I have had to go through a lot of difficulties recently, and then I get this notice. It was like a kick in the teeth. Halbey will have until May 2016 to find a new place to live, along with her dog and her cat. The three-story building, where she rented a 90 sq/m flat will now be turned into accommodation for refugees, who are seeking to make Germany their new home.The mayor of Nieheim, Rainer Vidal, which has a population of just over 6,000, defended the decision to send the nurse packing, saying converting the building would be  the cheapest option. A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost  30,000 ($33,600). This solution will cost me nothing,  he told Die Welt.Over half the population of Germany lives in rented accommodation and the country has laws to defend the rights of tenants. Normally, only a private individual can terminate the terms of a contract for personal use. A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable,  Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants  Federation, told the Telegraph.

1613, Dan Rather Breaks The Internet With SEARING Rebuke Of Trump’s ‘Andrew Jackson’ Comment,"With Trump in the White House, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has an awful lot to say, probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times, and Trump is a dangerous buffoon, the likes of which we ve never seen. He doesn t comment on everything, and he apparently didn t want to comment on Trump s idea that Andrew Jackson was angry about the Civil War. But he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out.According to his Facebook post on the topic, the  sheer craziness of this obsession by Donald Trump with Andrew Jackson and the Civil War is a carnival act unlike anything I have ever seen at the White House. These are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing. Should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half-baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history? Trump, at the very least, has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history. He recently told Reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard. He also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.Sure, Trump. The only people who did know are, well, pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation.That isn t all Rather blasted Trump about. He also dropped this truth bomb, with hell of a burn at the end, on Trump: To be President of the United States is to part of the great American story. To not understand that story is to not understand the presidency. Maybe Frederick Douglass can give Mr. Trump some advice. Apparently, he s  an example of somebody who s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more.

2622, Trump Tweets Fake List Of ‘Fake News’ The Media Has Run And Gets STOMPED By Twitter (TWEETS),"On Wednesday, Donald Trump once again lashed out at the media with a scathing article about 16  fake news  stories that have been published since Trump became President*.'16 Fake News Stories Reporters Have Run Since Trump Won' https://t.co/0dHld5kiVc  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017The site featuring the list, The Federalist, is a known purveyor of right-wing hoaxes and is about as reliable as Betsy DeVos in any of the many bear attacks that occur in our schools year-round, but Trump saw a headline he liked and tweeted it out because, to him, fact-checking is a waste of time. Besides, Trump is in the middle of the largest anti-media campaign since Adolf Hitler went out of his way to discredit the media to allow him to more effectively consolidate power   and this article aids that goal nicely:We are in the midst of an epidemic of fake news. There is no better word to describe it than  epidemic,  insofar as it fits the epidemiological model from the Centers for Disease Control: this phenomenon occurs when  an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts. The  agent  in this case is hysteria over Trump s presidency, and the  susceptible hosts  are a slipshod, reckless, and breathtakingly gullible media class that spread the hysteria around like well, like a virus.It is difficult to adequately sum up the breadth of this epidemic, chiefly because it keeps growing: day after day, even hour after hour, the media continue to broadcast, spread, promulgate, publicize, and promote fake news on an industrial scale. It has become a regular part of our news cycle, not distinct from or extraneous to it but a part of it, embedded within the news apparatus as a spoke is embedded in a bicycle wheel.Whenever you turn on a news station, visit a news website, or check in on a journalist or media personality on Twitter or Facebook, there is an excellent chance you will be exposed to fake news. It is rapidly becoming an accepted part of the way the American media are run.The list that follows, unsurprisingly, contains stories with mostly minor errors that were all corrected quickly because that s how it works when initial reporting is incorrect. Others are simply stuff Donald Trump has done that The Federalist elected to simply say are  fake news    like his threat to send troops into Mexico, Trump s decision to ease sanctions on Russia, and the GOP rolling back Obama-era regulations that prevent the mentally ill from owning guns.Fortunately, not everyone is as stupid as Trump s followers and The Donald was quickly called out for sharing this list from such a disreputable source:Oh for Pete s sake.

Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 8, 2017Though he says the phrase a lot, even Trump likely doesn t actually believe the things he falsely calls  fake news  are fake news. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, explained Monday that the administration will keep using the term until the media realizes they are wrong for attacking Trump with facts. There is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media, not just the pollsters, the majority of the media to attack a duly elected President in the second week of his term,  he says. That s how unhealthy the situation is and until the media understands how wrong that attitude is, and how it hurts their credibility, we are going to continue to say,  fake news . Gorka is a former editor for white supremacist propaganda website Breitbart, which President Steve Bannon used to run.Yes, fake news exists. You usually see it on sites like nbc.com.co.qwdsff4wf.org. But none of these stories, even the ones with errors, earn that classification. What does qualify as  fake news  is President Asterisk s claim that President Obama was born in Kenya, that millions voted illegally for his opponent, and that anyone who disagrees with Donald Trump or says anything unflattering about him is pushing  fake news.

5740, ‘Never Trump’: Another Well-Known GOP Figure Endorses Hillary,"Despite some noises being made by some Republican detractors, for all intents and purposes the party is stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee and the choice will be official at the party s upcoming convention.While some major Republicans like George W. Bush and Mitt Romney have announced their opposition to Trump, not as many have gone all-in and endorsed Hillary Clinton for President, instead preferring to simply oppose Trump without offering up a serious alternative.Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has gone a step further, and in an op-ed published in the Washington Post, is now endorsing Clinton.He doesn t mince his words:The GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism. This troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough. It s time to put country before party and say it together: Never Trump.Paulson just absolutely blasts Trump s supposed business prowess noting,  he takes imprudent risks and, when his businesses fail, disavows his debts. Citing his first-hand experience with passing TARP after the economy began collapsing and the need to get Democrats and Republicans to agree on it, Paulson notes:  This requires a president who exhibits an ability to compromise   and basic civility   neither of which Trump displays. It isn t as if Paulson has become a liberal overnight. He points out that he still supports Republicans at the state level, and the overall tone of his essay is that he would support a standard-issue Republican if Trump were one.But he isn t, and as a result he lays out the case for Clinton as better for business even if he disagrees with some of her philosophy.He concludes:I ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world.

18796,SUPER BOWL CHAMP PLAYER Busts Into WH Press Briefing: “Need any help?”…Liberal Snowflakes Have A Meltdown! [Video],"IT S INTERESTING THAT A LIGHTHEARTED MOMENT LIKE THE ONE BELOW COULD CAUSE SUCH ANGER AND OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT!Rob Gronkowksi popped into today s White House press briefing to ask Sean Spicer if he needed any help. Spicer, a Patriots fan, declined the offer. Mild laughs were had. Gronkowski then disappeared, presumably to cause more mischief in other parts of the building.It s not surprising that the tight end performed a bit like this. That he was wearing a shirt while doing it was a bit of a shock.Right after this video was posted Facebook comments were brutal about how unprofessional it was to have this guy pop into the briefing. We had Obama s antics for 8 years and these people can t take one light moment like this?The left went nuts with faux outrage: We can think of many moments during the Obama administration where some  unprofessional  antics took place. The only problem is that these  antics  are much more serious Remember Jay Carney? Well, here are 6 big moments he s caught in BIG lies. We consider this to be much more important than what happened today.6 OF THE TOP  ANTICS  FROM WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS UNDER OBAMA   JAY CARNEY S NOT FUNNY BUT SERIOUS  GAFFES : 1. When he said he knows 3 people named  Hilary Rosen.  After Obama adviser Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney hadn t worked a day in her life, it was discovered Rosen had visited the White House numerous times. When questioned on it, Carney claimed he knew 3 separate women named  Hilary Rosen. 2. That one time he stumbled when asked why the Obama Administration withheld a crucial Benghazi email.3. That day when he called a reporter s repeated questions on Kathleen Sebelius  lame. 4. That time he admitted White House staff knew of the IRS scandal and didn t tell Obama.5. That time he admitted that the Obama Budget wouldn t balance.6. That moment when he finally admitted Obama s  Keep Your Plan  promise wasn t true.Shouldn t the liberal snowflakes be outraged at what Jay Carney did?

12030,SHERIFF CLARKE Destroys Idiocy Of Gun Control In Democrat Ghetto Hell-Holes Like BLOOD-SOAKED CHICAGO,"As usual Milwaukee s outspoken Sheriff David Clarke nails it Chicago has plunged ever further into chaos as gang violence gripped the city for yet another weekend.Under the rule of Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the city has seen some of its worst violence in over two decades. There have been more than 750 shooting deaths in 2016 alone. Over the Christmas weekend, 50 people were shot, and 12 were killed   double the number from last year. Gang violence accounts for most of the killings   nearly 90%   and the perpetrators all had long criminal histories. Most are  targeted attacks  between rival gangs, according to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. During his press conference on Monday, Johnson said they recovered 45 guns from the streets over the holiday weekend.These guns didn t come from law-abiding Chicagoans who face some of the strictest gun laws in the country, but from hardened criminals who don t obey laws. Johnson knows that stricter gun laws never stops violence:  These gun offenders have repeatedly shown us that they re not going to play by society s rules. So, he s calling for tougher penalties for repeat gun offenders. It s painfully obvious more gun laws will do nothing.It s time Democrat ghetto hellholes like Chicago pay attention to what s happening in their pro-gun controlled cities instead of learning the hard way that criminals don t care what laws are on the books. It s never acceptable to take away the rights of good people to offer the illusion of safety. Crack down on crime, make the punishments severe, and allow law-abiding citizens protect themselves.

17182,OBAMA’S RACE WAR: HATEFUL IMAGES EMERGE OF CLASH BETWEEN KKK AND BLACK PANTHERS IN SC…One Viral Photo Offers America Hope,"The fundamental transformation of America continues . But one photo emerges that defies Barack and Michelle Obama s hateful and divisive narrative.In the latest chapter of the outcry over the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina, an unexpected scene emerged from rallies involving the Ku Klux Klan and black supporters this weekend   a photo of a black police officer helping a white supremacist at the Capitol in Charleston.Members of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK were protesting the state s recent decision to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds. Black advocates held their own rally, and a clash among the two parties ensued.IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH HATE, ONE HOPEFUL PHOTO EMERGED: It didn t take long for the photograph   taken by Rob Godfrey, the deputy chief of staff for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley   to spread on the Internet. Not an uncommon example of humanity in SC: Leroy Smith helps white supremacist to shelter & water as heat bears down,  Godfrey wrote in posting the photo on Twitter.Officer Leroy Smith was helping the man find shade and water on a hot day in Charleston, when temperatures reached the upper 90s. About 2,000 people attended the rallies. He was assisting with crowd control on the stairs where the KKK was rallying,  spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said of Smith.As might be expected, the general public largely fell into one of two camps   applauding the photo, or questioning it. This kindness chokes me up. How do SC people find that well of caring in the midst of so much hatred?  one person replied in the photo s comment thread. Amazing! I couldn t find it in my heart and I am white,  another remarked. Just curious. Put this in reverse. Would that White Supremacist have done that for Officer Smith at a Black Panther rally?  countered one tweet. Being nice didn t save those 9 people [at the Charleston church shooting] though,  posted another.Thursday, Haley encouraged people to stay away from the KKK rally. The strength and grace the people of South Carolina have shown over the last three weeks have inspired our family, our neighbors and the entire world,  she wrote on her Facebook page.  Our family hopes the people of South Carolina will join us in staying away from the disruptive, hateful spectacle members of the Ku Klux Klan hope to create.

18109,LIBERALS HAVE NO BUSINESS Criticizing President Trump Until They Can Explain What Former President Obama Is Doing In This Photo,"The Democrats and their allies in the media have spent most of this entire week condemning President Trump for blaming both sides for the violent confrontations in Charlottesville, Va. The problem is, President Trump never once condoned the actions of the KKK or the Nazi sympathizers. Trump simply said that both sides (including the violent Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters) were at fault.Where was the condemnation from the media and the Democrat Party when President Barack Obama eulogized the former KKK Grand Dragon Robert Byrd?  In the early 1940s, a politically ambitious butcher from West Virginia named Bob Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to form a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. After Byrd had collected the $10 joining fee and $3 charge for a robe and hood from every applicant, the  Grand Dragon  for the mid-Atlantic states came down to tiny Crab Orchard, W.Va., to officially organize the chapter.As Byrd recalls now, the Klan official, Joel L. Baskin of Arlington, Va., was so impressed with the young Byrd s organizational skills that he urged him to go into politics.  The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation,  Baskin said.The young Klan leader went on to become one of the most powerful and enduring figures in modern Senate history. Throughout a half-century on Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) has twice held the premier leadership post in the Senate, helped win ratification of the Panama Canal treaty, squeezed billions from federal coffers to aid his home state, and won praise from liberals for his opposition to the war in Iraq and his defense of minority party rights in the Senate.   Washington PostWhen the KKK Grand Dragon died in July of 2010, President Barack Obama eulogized him, while Hillary Clinton sang the praises of the West Virginia Democrat Senator Robert Byrd she called her  mentor. During his eulogy, President Barack Obama expressed his admiration for the KKK Grand Dragon and later, the US Senator Robert Byrd: And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice,  Obama said.  Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.

17561,WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT To Recognize Jerusalem As Israel’s Capital,"After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.

20659,QUESTION: Which Presidential Candidate Spent The Most On Their Campaign So Far? The ANSWER May Surprise You…,"And the winner is the  Anti-Billionaire or the guy who detests rich people or how about the guy who made a LOT of people rich during his campaign, but did absolutely nothing for the less fortunate with his windfall. In fact, we reported about hundreds of homeless people who were kicked out of a venue they used as a warming hut on the coldest night of the year because socialist Bernie Sanders (who cares so much for the poor and underprivileged) was about to host a rally in that venue. Oh well the show must go on who has time for homeless people who likely won t vote .right hypocrite Bernie?The small-dollar fundraising juggernaut that has kept Bernie Sanders s insurgent White House bid afloat far longer than anticipated has generated another unexpected impact: a financial windfall for his team of Washington consultants.As donations surged this year, the Sanders campaign ratcheted up its spending each month, racing through an astounding $45 million in March alone.By the end of March, the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont had spent nearly $166 million on his campaign   more than any other 2016 presidential contender, including rival Hillary Clinton. More than $91 million went to a small group of admakers and media buyers who produced a swarm of commercials and placed them on television, radio and online, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Election Commission reports.While the vast majority of that money was passed along to television stations and websites to pay for the advertising, millions in fees were kept by the companies, The Post calculated. While it is impossible to determine precisely how much the top consultants have earned, FEC filings indicate the top three media firms have reaped payments of seven figures.Sanders s money blitz, fueled by a $27 average donation that he repeatedly touts, has improbably made the anti-billionaire populist the biggest spender so far in the election cycle. The campaign s wealth has been a surprising boon for vendors across the county who signed on to his long-shot bid.The large profits stem in part from the fact that no one in Sanders s campaign imagined he would generate such enormous financial support. So unlike Clinton, he did not cap how much his consultants could earn in commissions from what was expected to be a bare-bones operation, according to campaign officials.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether Sanders feels the high fees earned by his media consultants are appropriate.

Jimmy always wonders about whether people are really paying attention to those issues or not.

3679," Clinton Campaign Announces BAD News For Trump, Will Participate In Recount (TWEETS)","On Saturday morning, Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel posted a statement to Medium to announce that the campaign will back recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Green Party candidate Jill Stein follows through with reexamining the votes in those states.The post was written by attorney Marc Erik Elias, who said that the campaign had been questioning the results since the election ended, weighing different options. Elias said: It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. Since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia. TwitterTwitterTwitterElias said that although actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  was not found, Stein s successful movement to get votes recounted in Wisconsin has persuaded the Clinton campaign to support the initiative. Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states Michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. Echoing Stein s own words about making sure that America s elections maintain integrity, Elias said: We believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported. Elias  entire statement can be read here. On Friday afternoon, Stein had filed for a recount in Wisconsin, promising to also follow through in Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Trump is leading by narrow margins. The deadline Stein must file for recounts in those states is Monday and Wednesday.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2016",morning campaign counsel statement campaign party candidate stein post attorney marc campaign election heartbreak felt principle democracy vote day election data result campaign politics technology evidence voting technology movement campaign initiative recount order process proceeds manner sides stein michigan approach number trump margin recount regardless outcome principle campaign court ground order recount process integrity obligation vote count statement afternoon stein recount promising trump deadline stein image
4827," WATCH: Trump’s Infantile Reference To His D*ck Size REALLY Shows Great Strength, Says Fox News","Fox News  resident doctor, if, indeed, he can be called that, weighed in on the ancient, but immature reference that Trump made to the size of his penis after Marco Rubio made a crack about his tiny hands during a debate in Detroit, Michigan. Keith Ablow, who really has some questionable things to say on the air, let loose with the following verbal rubbish heap: When the  small hands  issue was raised during the debate that supposedly got the Clinton campaign very excited, they thought  Man, he s off his game he wasn t off his game at all. Freud would have been standing up, like applauding. Standing ovation. Ablow the Blowhard went on with: To be able to address such an intensely personal issue and say,  Listen, there s no problem in that department,  to me, that showed an incredible degree of psychological strength. Or it showed an incredible immaturity   something that s only been solidified as this election cycle has gone on. Trump could have, and really should have, just ignored the jab about his hands. Instead, he said: Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands   if they are small, something else must be small.I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee you. Because self defense. He missed a golden opportunity to make Rubio look like an immature, tasteless idiot. As is so common with Trump, though, he slipped into insecure teenage-boy mode and bragged about his penis size, which is literally relevant to nothing.

4288, That Time Donald Trump Said Bill Clinton Was The ‘Victim’ Of ‘Unattractive Women’,"Donald Trump is pledging to bring up Bill Clinton s sexual prowess at the second presidential debate. Now that Trump is in the hot seat over a hot mic leak that shows him gleefully admitting to sexual assault, he does what he knows best   deflect.In his half assed apology, Trump took responsibility for his comments, saying that a video from 10 years ago does not reflect the  man  he is now, but said Bill Clinton has done  much worse  and that Hillary Clinton was complacent in bullying and intimidating his victims.So that  the Trump strategy   deflect from his admissions of sexual assault by drumming up sins of Bill Clinton from the 1990s to smear Hillary (because women just love it when the wife is blamed for the husband s misgivings). There s only one teeny tiny problem with that, though.I don t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.That s Donald Trump, in August 1998, calling Bill Clinton the real victim. In an interview with Fox News  Neil Cavuto, the billionaire mogul also trashed Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg as a  really unattractive group  and an  unattractive cast of characters. The transcripts are as followed:The whole thing, it s just so unattractive. Linda Tripp may be one of the most unattractive human beings I ve ever seen not women, human beings. She s just an unattractive person. This [Lucianne] Goldberg person, her agent or whatever she is, is just a terrible woman. You look at Paula Jones, I mean the whole cast of characters. It s like it s from Hell. It s a terrible group of peopleBut Trump wasn t finished insulting their personal appearances:The whole group, it s truly an unattractive cast of characters Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg I mean, this woman I watch her on television, just vomiting. She is so bad. The whole group Paula Jones, Lewinsky it s just a really unattractive group. And I m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.Trump then went on to say that had Lewinsky and Jones been  supermodels,  they would be  more pleasant to watch. Once again, Trump proves that he does not care about women unless they are visually appealing (which is completely subjective).But now, all of a sudden, he s their unsung hero against  abuser  Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary?Gee, what changed?If one thinks Trump truly cares about Jones, Lewinsky, Brodderick, Flowers or any of Clinton s alleged victims, they should keep in mind that Trump only cares about their appearances   and their appearances discount them   and he thinks Bill is the real victim.Do not be deceived America.

10331,"HORRIFIC Human Trafficking Case: 8 PEOPLE FOUND DEAD, 38 Locked Inside Tractor-Trailer Outside Walmart…No A/C…101 Degrees [VIDEO]","Anyone who takes part in this type of sub-human criminal activity should never see the light of day again. The lawmakers who refuse to lock down our borders and stiffen the penalties for human traffickers who bring illegal aliens into the U.S. should also be held accountable by their constituents Eight people were found dead in a tractor-trailer outside a Walmart store in the stifling summer heat in what police called a horrific human trafficking case, and the driver was arrested.Several other people, possibly dozens, were found in the truck, which didn t have a working air conditioning system despite blistering temperatures that topped 100 degrees, and they were taken to hospitals, authorities said. The driver had been held, authorities said, but they didn t release the driver s identity.A person from the truck approached a Walmart employee in a parking lot and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said police in San Antonio, where temperatures on Saturday reached 101 degrees. The employee gave the person the water and then called police, and when officers arrived they found the eight people dead in the back of the trailer, police Chief William McManus said.Investigators checked store surveillance video, which showed vehicles had arrived and picked up other people from the tractor-trailer, police said. We re looking at a human trafficking crime this evening,  McManus said.He called the case  a horrific tragedy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was involved in the investigation into what happened, he said.The National Weather Service s local office said the temperature in San Antonio hit 101 degrees just before 5 p.m. Saturday and didn t dip below 90 degrees until after 10 p.m.Other cases of human trafficking in the United States have led to more deaths. In May 2003, 19 immigrants being transported from South Texas to Houston died inside a sweltering tractor-trailer.Prosecutors said the driver in the 2003 case heard the immigrants begging and screaming for their lives as they were succumbing to the stifling heat inside his truck but refused to free them. The driver was resentenced in 2011 to nearly 34 years in prison after a federal appeals court overturned the multiple life sentences he had received.  NYPMany of the human trafficking cases are related to human traffickers bringing illegal aliens into the United States:Jalopnik   In July 2013, Authorities in Mexico charged a truck driver with human trafficking after discovering 94 people in his vehicle headed to the United States.A report from Reuters says that the 94 people packed into a truck were found near the southern city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the state of Chiapas. Among them were 19 people from Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. They were detected in an X-ray scan Monday night outside Tuxtla Gutierrez.Officials say the migrants were kept in inhumane conditions.

14864,Hillary’s Latest Ad Pushes Muslim Agenda Of Submission To Men,"So the irony isn t lost on me when I saw the still shot of Hillary wearing the Muslim symbol of submission to men in her new ad. This woman wants to be seen as strong and knowledgeable on foreign policy but obviously doesn t understand the message she s sending out. Does Hillary Clinton not know what wearing a hijab means or is she just that stupid to throw one on for votes? It s like when she puts on the phony Southern accent when she s in South Carolina. Pandering to the Muslims and those that think it s just so great that she s so diverse tells us all we need to know about this hag. She d do anything to get elected even wear a symbol of oppression how ironic! Daniel Greenfield gives us the lowdown on the symbolism of wearing a hijab:Hillary s latest campaign video tries to build up her non-existent foreign policy experience. That means making as much as possible out of her feminist speech in China  which avoided criticizing a Communist regime that forces women to have abortions. (Or as her Planned Parenthood pals call it, health care outreach.) And showing her travel photo slideshow.It s basically like those travel videos friends force you to watch  except this is a really expensive commercial and no one can force you to watch it.But in odd contrast to touting Hillary s feminism and strength, is this shot of her wearing a Hijab; an Islamic garment of submission.Not only has the Hijab consistently been a source of Muslim violence against women, both in punishing women who don t wear it and punishing women who take it off, but its origins lie in an Islamic commandment distinguishing Muslim women, who couldn t be raped, from non-Muslim slave women captured by Mohammed s rampaging gang.It s really quite explicit.The Koranic verse that mandates covering states,  O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies that they may thus be distinguished and not molested  (Koran 33:59)That s not modesty. The covering is being worn to avoid rape.The key words here are  distinguished and not molested . Whom are these women being distinguished from? Women who don t cover up and can be molested.Hillary s  cloak  is incomplete by Saudi or Taliban standards, but all these coverings are meant to be a symbolic form of Purdah, the physical confinement of a woman, even within her home.In her commercial, Hillary Clinton, by wearing the Hijab, is advertising that she is the property of a man and therefore  not to be molested . Of course since Islamic law doesn t recognize the marriages of non-Muslim peoples it is at war with, enabling Jihadis to sexually assault even married non-Muslim women, as the Islamic prophet Mohammed allowed his Muslim followers to do, it s also a meaningless gesture.Is it really a feminist gesture to voluntarily accept the Islamic distinction between women who can be assaulted and women who can t?Either way it s certainly a step back for a female politician who wants to be seen as a leader and a fighter for women.Via: Front Page Magazine",politics,"Nov 30, 2015",irony shot symbol submission men ad woman policy message accent hag anything symbol oppression symbolism campaign video policy experience speech china communist regime parenthood health care outreach travel photo force one contrast feminism strength shot garment submission source violence commandment gang verse covering rape key cover cloak form purdah confinement woman home property man course law war non prophet gesture gesture distinction way step politician leader fighter page magazine

15379,THE FIX IS IN: JUDGE QUICKLY BLOCKS ABORTION VIDEOS AND NOW WE KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY,"Judge William H. Orrick, III joins Obama in his desire to keep the Planned parenthood abortion videos from coming out. He quickly granted a restraining order against the release of the videos. Did anyone else think it was really fast and very unusual that a judge would take such swift action? Well, we thought so too and now we know why. Orrick is an Obama appointee and was a bundler for the Obama campaign!A federal judge late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers. The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama. He was also a major donor to and bundler for President Obama s presidential campaign. He raised at least $200,000 for Obama and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him, according to Public Citizen.Even though the National Abortion Federation filed its claim only hours before, Orrick quickly decided in their favor that the abortionists they represent would, ironically, be  likely to suffer irreparable injury, absent an ex parte temporary restraining order, in the form of harassment, intimidation, violence, invasion of privacy, and injury to reputation, and the requested relief is in the public interest.
